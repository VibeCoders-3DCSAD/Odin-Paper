# Notes

1. All *italicized statements* (including their subsections) are suggestions that may be modified with justification.

2. Article flow is hierarchical; if a system module, component, or general feature has dependencies, all of those must be discussed fully and completely first before it.

   2.1. The discussion of said dependencies must be as close to the dependent module as possible. For example, three dependency features for dependent feature A must be discussed in order of Article I, II, III (dependencies), then IV (dependent). Feature B whose dependencies are not the exact same must not be Article IV.

3. A system feature or topic merits its own article if it is depended upon by at least two other features or topics. If a feature is used by only one other feature or is self‑contained, it shall be described within that dependent feature's article as a section.

4. Cross‑cutting dependencies, or dependencies with two or more dependents, provided that they qualify as articles, shall be defined in dedicated articles before any module that uses them. These articles appear in order of conceptual dependency (e.g. User → Account → Transaction → Category).

## ===== Article II. Users =====

### Section 1. Target Users

1. The System is designed exclusively for the following users.

    1.1. Demographic requirement. The user shall be a Filipino working young adult aged twenty to forty years inclusive.

    1.2. Geographic requirement. The user shall live or work in Metro Manila, covering any of its sixteen cities and one municipality.

    1.3. Employment requirement. The user shall *classify their primary employment in* any of the following capacities:

        1.3.1 Regular Employees. This employment type is entitled to security of tenure, and usually entitled to statutory benefits (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, 13th month pay) on a pro-rata basis. This employment type supports the Stable income dimension.

            1.3.1.1. Full‑time Employee

            1.3.1.2. Part‑time Employee

        1.3.2. Independent Contractors. This employment type has variable security of tenure, and usually no employer-employee relationship. The individuals are responsible for their own taxes and governmental contributions as voluntary members. This employment type supports the Variable income dimension.

            1.3.2.1. Self‑employed Individual
            
            1.3.2.2. Freelancer
            
            1.3.2.3. Business Owner

            1.3.2.4. Entrepreneur

        1.3.3. Fixed-Term and Project Employees. This employment type has variable or low security of tenure. The individuals are employed only for the length of their contractual obligations (project completion dates, termination dates). This employment type supports the Variable income dimension.

            1.3.4. Contractual/project‑based employee or similar

            1.3.5. Business owner/entrepreneur

            1.3.6. Gig economy worker

    > NOTE: Primary employment is emphasized since the user can have more than one job (side hustles, freelancing). In the financial behavioral profile classification module, employment shall not bear more influence than other more appropriate features like income sources, income amount, income frequency, etc., which better defines the user's income stability.

    > NOTE: The "This employment type supports..." parts could probably be moved to the Financial Behavioral Profile Article/Section.

    > Employment classifications are based on the Department of Labor and Employment's own standards (Labor Code of the Philippines).

## ===== Article III. App Installation =====

### Section 1. Installation Site

1. *The System shall be distributed as a mobile‑first application for Android devices via an Android Package Kit.*

2. *The desktop web version shall be accessible via a standard web browser at a domain designated accordingly.*

### Section 2. Installation Guide

> NOTE: Add installation guide for the user starting from installation site all the way to working mobile app.

---

## ===== Article IV. Financial Behavioral Profile Structure =====

### Section 1. Financial Behavioral Dimensions

1. There are two binary dimensions that define the four financial behavioral profiles: **Income Stability** and **Obligation Level**.

2. Income stability is the capacity of the user's inflow to maintain a stable amount and frequency in regular intervals.

3. Depending on the user's income stability, they can be classified as either **Stable** or **Variable**.
    
4. Income stability shall be derived initially from the user’s *employment status and income variability as declared during onboarding*.

    4.1. Afterwards, income stability shall be derived from the user's actual transaction history.

5. Obligation level is the proportion of the user's necessary expenses (sum of Essential and Obligatory expenses; see Article X) and their total expenses.

6. Depending on the user's obligation level, they can be classified as either **Flexible** or **Obligated**.

7. Obligation level shall be derived from *declared fixed obligations, dependents, debt payments, and protected expenses as declared during onboarding*.

    7.1. Afterwards, obligation level shall be derived from the user's actual transaction history.

### Section 2. Financial Behavioral Profile

1. The financial behavioral profiles are derived from a combination of the user's income stability and obligation ratio.

2. The four financial behavioral profiles are:

    2.1. **Stable‑Flexible**

    2.2. **Stable‑Obligated**

    2.3. **Variable‑Flexible**

    2.4. **Variable‑Obligated**

> NOTE: Outline the process of executing the Random Forest classification model, namely its input phase, process phase, and output phase. 

### Section 1. Manual Classification

> NOTE: Manual classification is when the user opts to select their profile instead of having the system assign it for them. This is when they have rejected their assigned profile during onboarding, or when they wish to change their profile via selection instead of retaking the questionnaire.

### Section 2. Questionnaire Classification

> NOTE: Questionnaire is different from the other classification processes, since the user invokes it during their registration or when they want to change their profile via the questionnaire.

### Section 3. Cold Start Classification

> NOTE: Cold start classification is when the system is due for its periodic reclassification check, but the user does not have sufficient transactions for the system to perform the standard classification.

    > Transaction Record (also known as "Add Transaction" or "Record Transaction")
        > Single
            > Income/Expense/Transfer
            > Manual/Recurring
        > Template
    > Template
        > Income/Expense/Transfer
        > Manual/Recurring

---

## ===== Article XI. Expense Structure =====

### Section 1. Expense

> NOTE: This discusses the Expense Item (or just Item) and its properties. 

> NOTE: Obviously, the user is in charge of creating the expense items. Items do not necessarily have to be one single individual object; they can be a collection of objects (e.g., Groceries: a collection of ingredients, goods, hygiene products) AS LONG AS that Item falls under one expense group ONLY (e.g., Groceries Item usually contains objects all classified as Essential). This is crucial for the forecasting and budget recommendation. In the event that a single expense item falls under more than one group, its costs must be split.

### Section 2. Expense Categories and Subcategories

> NOTE: This discusses the Subcategories to which Items are classified under (e.g. Ingredients under Food, Milk under Non-Alcoholic Beverages). This also discusses the Categories to which Subcategories are classified under (e.g. Food Subcategory under Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages Category).

> NOTE: Categories and Subcategories are based on the PSA PCOICOP.

> NOTE: Users can also create their own custom categories and subcategories, but they must classify it under an expense group. 

### Section 3. Expense Groups

> NOTE: This discusses the Groups to which Categories are classified under (e.g. Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages under Essentials).

> NOTE: Users cannot create a custom expense group. 

### Section 4. Expense Restrictions

> NOTE: Expense Categories and Subcategories have Restriction Levels that can be set by the user. The system also creates default levels for each. They can be Free, meaning their floors and ceilings can be set to whatever; Protected, meaning their floors are set; and Locked, meaning both the floor and ceiling are one, AKA there's a set amount that must be reached, no more and no less.

## ===== Article XII. Transaction Entry Module =====

### Section 1. Manual Transaction Entry

### Section 2. Recurring Transaction Entry

---

## ===== Article XIII. Transaction History Module =====

### Section 1. Transaction Records

### Section 2. Transaction Records Searching Operations

> NOTE: Includes searching, sorting, and filtering.

### Section 3. Transaction Editing & Deletion

> NOTE: Idk if it's more appropriate to discuss this topic here or in the intelligent modules that are affected by it, like the forecasting module. Or maybe an exact "Transaction Editing & Deletion" section in those modules as well?

### Section 2. Transaction Record Retention

> NOTE: The retention limit must be validated official guidelines, like from the BSP.

> NOTE: Should discuss floors and ceilings.

### Section 6. Budget Feasibility

---

## ===== Article XV. Budget Strategy Structure =====

### Section 1. Budget Strategy

> NOTE: Should discuss the components of a budget strategy, like hierarchy and stuff. Here's what I'm thinking. The given budget strategies (e.g. 50/30/20) need to be distilled into a set of configurations, such that the user, with the custom budget strategy feature, can replicate the given budget strategies.
> There needs to be a restriction configuration (for the 50% needs portion of 50/30/20 that cannot be reduced, for example). There also needs to be a hierarchy configuration, for the order of allocation.
> We can brainstorm

> NOTE: The given budget strategies should be sourced from those mentioned in the RRL.

### Section 4. Output

### Section 6. Details

> NOTE: Should discuss posterior things like algorithm evaluation, explainability, fallback, etc., preferably as sections.

> NOTE: Maybe move all expainability sections/subsections of algorithm articles to their process articles isntead.

## ===== Article XVI. Budget Recommendation Process =====

### Section 1. Cold-Start Budget Recommendation

> NOTE: Can cold-start budget recommendations be affected by budget infeasibility? 

### Section 2. Standard Budget Recommendation

### Section 3. Budget Infeasibility & Reduction

> NOTE: This section is for when budget size exceeds current balance plus foreseeable income streams. Discuss which allocations are reduced; in what order, and by how much per. Also need to discuss what to do when, after all legal reductions are performed, the budget is still infeasible. It may be important to consider not to tell the user outright that they don't have enough money for the budget period, as that can invoke panic and despair. This is an unfortunate occurence that is a reality to some Filipinos today, so our system must also be sensitive aside from being intelligent and ethical.

### Section 1. Budget Recommendation

### Section 2. Budget Health

> NOTE: Should include a health indicator and prescribed vs. actual tracker

### Section 3. Budget Surplus and Deficit

> NOTE: Should also discuss Budget Surplus Strategies (e.g., move surplus to balance or savings goal?)

> NOTE: We can justify allotting surplus to the currently most prioritized savings goal, justified by the Zero-Based Budget Strategy.

> NOTE: We also have to consider, what if the user does not have any savings goals at all?

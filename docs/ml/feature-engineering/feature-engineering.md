# Feature Engineering Pipeline

**Module:** Feature Engineering
**Script:** `BUDI-ML/training/scripts/feature_engineering.py`
**Input:** `BUDI-ML/training/datasets/processed/` (preprocessed raw data)
**Output:** `BUDI-ML/training/datasets/engineered/` (engineered feature matrices)

---

## Purpose

The feature engineering pipeline transforms preprocessed raw data into enriched feature matrices ready for model training. It is a separate step from preprocessing, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

Key design principles:
1. **Features computed incrementally** — each month uses only historical data (months 1..M)
2. **Select/transform fit on train only** — no data leakage to val/test
3. **Two computation modes** — incremental (full synthesis data) or direct (preprocessed rows)
4. **Drop-in redundant feature removal** — addresses multicollinearity identified in EDA
5. **Feature selection + PCA** — dimensionality reduction options

### New Features Added in Phase 5

### Redundant Features (auto-dropped when `--drop-redundant` is enabled)

Based on EDA correlation analysis (|r| > 0.98 threshold):

| Kept | Dropped | Correlation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `obligation_ratio` | `essential_ratio` | r = 1.000 |
| `savings_rate` | `savings_income_ratio` | r = 0.999 |
| `category_entropy` | `expense_regularity` | r = 0.992 |

## Normalization Strategy

The preprocessor exports scalers (`scalers.json`) fitted on the raw training data. These scalers are carried forward to `BUDI-ML/training/datasets/engineered/` unchanged.

Future work: Move normalization into this module once the separation is fully validated.

## Two Computation Modes

### Mode A: Incremental (preferred)

Requires synthesis data in `BUDI-ML/training/synth/`. Computes features per persona per month using only historical data (months 1..M). This is the same methodology as the original preprocessor.

```bash
python BUDI-ML/training/scripts/feature_engineering.py --synth-dir BUDI-ML/training/synth/
```

### Mode B: Direct (fallback)

Works without synthesis data. Computes features directly from each row's cumulative raw columns in the preprocessed data. Less accurate for trend/volatility features but useful when synth data is unavailable.

*Automatic fallback when `monthly_summaries.parquet` is missing.*

## Output Files

### `train.parquet`, `val.parquet`, `test.parquet`

Feature matrices with metadata, raw, and engineered columns. Schema includes:
- `user_id`, `month`, `pfp_label`, `is_anomalous`, `anomaly_type`
- `total_income`, `total_expenses`, `food_expense`, ... (raw)
- All selected engineered features (derived + cyclical + interaction)

### `feature_columns.json`

Column metadata including feature names, ranges, selection scores, and redundant drop info.

### `pipeline_report.json`

Quality report with feature counts, selection info, PCA variance, and split sizes.

### Carried Forward from Preprocessor

- `scalers.json` — normalization parameters (train-fitted)
- `split_metadata.json` — persona assignments per split
- `temporal_folds.json` — walk-forward validation folds

## Missing Value Handling

| Feature Type | Imputation Strategy |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Critical (CV, obligation_ratio) | Median from training set |
| Other derived features | 0 |
| Interaction features | computed from imputed inputs |

## Outlier Handling

| Feature | Method |
|---------|--------|
| `debt_to_income` | Capped at 99th percentile (from training set) |
| `savings_rate` | Capped at 99th percentile (from training set) |

## Leakage Prevention

| # | Check | Implementation |
|---|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Incremental features | Each month's features use only months 1..M |
| 2 | Train-only imputation | Medians computed from train only |
| 3 | Train-only outlier caps | 99th percentile from train only |
| 4 | Train-only selection | Feature selection fit on train only |
| 5 | Train-only PCA | PCA fit on train only |
| 6 | No lookahead | Features never use future data |

# Verify outputs
python -c "
import pandas as pd
for split in ['train', 'val', 'test']:
    df = pd.read_parquet(f'BUDI-ML/training/datasets/engineered/{split}.parquet')
    print(f'{split}: {df.shape[0]} rows, {df[\"user_id\"].nunique()} personas, {len(df.columns)} columns')
"

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Separate module | Feature engineering decoupled from preprocessing | Separation of concerns, independent development |
| Two computation modes | Incremental + direct | Flexibility for different data availability scenarios |
| Cyclical encoding | Sin/cos for month | Preserves cyclic nature (month 12 adjacent to month 1) |
| Redundant feature drop | |r| > 0.98 threshold | Based on EDA findings; prevents multicollinearity |
| Mutual info selection | Default feature selection method | Handles non-linear relationships |
| PCA as optional | Variance threshold or component count | User chooses based on model requirements |
| Parquet output | Columnar, compressed | Fast I/O for large datasets |

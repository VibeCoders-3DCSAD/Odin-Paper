# **Crosswalk**

This section serves to map the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 2021 Consumer Finance Survey (CFS) fields to the Philippine Statistics Authority 2023 FIES microdata, document the unit-of-analysis equivalence assumptions, and formally justify the 12-archetype roster against BSP segmentation.

## **Unit-of-Analysis Mapping**

### **Survey Units**

| Survey Unit | Unit Definition | Implication |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **BSP CFS 2021** |  |  |
| Individual respondent (18+) | One respondent per household; questions about personal financial behavior, attitudes, and inclusion | Behavioral/attitudinal data is individual-level but reported per household |
| **PSA FIES 2023** |  |  |
| Household aggregate | One row per household; income and expenditure totals summed across all household members | Financial numerical data is household-level, not individual |
| **BUDI Target** |  |  |
| Individual user (18+) | One PFP classification per user; transaction history is individual-level | Target user is a single individual within a household |

### **Disaggregation Assumption**

FIES data is household-aggregate, but BUDI targets individual users. The persona-generation pipeline applies the following disaggregation:

1. Income disaggregation: Household income *(TOINC)* is divided by household size *(FSIZE)* to produce a per-capita income proxy. For archetypes with known employment status, income is further adjusted by employment-type multipliers (e.g., regular salaried \= 1.0× per-capita, freelance \= 0.7× per-capita reflecting irregular receipts).  
2. Expense disaggregation: Household expense categories *(FOOD, HOUSING\_WATER, TRANSPORT, etc.)* are divided by household size to produce per-capita expense proxies. Archetype-specific adjustments are applied (e.g., single-person households absorb 100% of food costs; multi-person households split costs).  
3. Savings rate: Computed as *(TOINC \- TOTEX) / TOINC* at the household level, then applied directly to the individual persona as the savings rate parameter.  
4. Emergency runway: Computed as *savings\_balance / monthly\_expenses* using the archetype's savings rate and expense level. Not directly available in FIES; derived from savings rate × months of accumulation.

### **Threat to Validity**

This disaggregation assumes that per-capita income and expense shares are reasonable proxies for individual financial profiles. In reality, household spending is not evenly distributed (e.g., primary earners bear disproportionate obligation weight). This mismatch is a known limitation, documented in each MDD's Section 13 under "Key Assumption (BSP-FIES crosswalk)."

| G | Freelancer, low obligations, healthy emergency fund | Variable·Flexible·Tolerant | Irregular income \+ no debt \+ strong savings | BSP: 32.7% entrepreneurial; low debt; 2.0% have 3+ months (top tier); high risk tolerance | Yes — canonical octant |
| H | Irregular earner, variable income, no emergency fund | Variable·Flexible·At-Risk | Informal income \+ no debt \+ no savings | BSP: 22.1% remittances; informal sector; no deposit account; minimal financial services | Yes — canonical octant |
| I | Recovering from financial shock | Variable·Obligated·At-Risk | Recently re-employed \+ depleted savings \+ debt from unemployment | BSP: 16.4% past-due bills; 29.3% debt; emergency credit during job loss; transitional state | Yes — edge case (shares octant with F; distinguished by temporal trajectory) |
| J | Variable income, low obligations, borderline tolerance | Variable·Flexible·At-Risk | Part-time \+ occasional income \+ borderline savings | BSP: 19.6% seasonal; borderline emergency fund (2.5 months); low debt | Yes — edge case (borderline Tolerant/At-Risk threshold) |

### **Edge-Case vs Canonical Distinction**

The 8 canonical archetypes (A–H) map one-to-one to the 8 PFP octants. The 4 edge-case archetypes (I–L) each share an octant with a canonical archetype but are distinguished by:

* I (shares Variable·Obligated·At-Risk with F): Temporal trajectory — recovering from financial shock rather than chronically paycheck-to-paycheck  
* J (shares Variable·Flexible·ight with H): Borderline threshold — financial tolerance near the 3-month boundary, not chronically zero  
* K (shares Stable·Obligated·Tolerant with A): Threshold proximity — obligation ratio near the 0.6 boundary, not deep into Obligated territory  
* L (shares Stable·Flexible·At-Risk with D): Behavioral distinction — stable income but deliberately low savings, not low-income with minimal savings

For Classifier training, all 12 archetypes resolve to one of the 8 PFP octants. Edge cases are included in training (not excluded) because they represent realistic within-octant variation that the Classifier must handle. The deterministic ground-truth formula labels them by their octant, regardless of edge-case status.

### **Out-of-Scope Archetypes (Not Included)**

| Archetype | Reason Excluded | BSP Overlap |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| OFW Dependent | Primarily a household composition type, not a financial behavior archetype; remittance income is captured by archetypes E, F, G, H | BSP: 22.1% receive remittances — captured by existing archetypes |
| Senior Citizen | Age-based, not behavior-based; pension income captured by existing archetypes | BSP: 17.4% receive pension — captured by existing archetypes |
| Retired Couple | Household composition, not financial behavior; pension \+ low obligations captured by archetype C or G | BSP: pension income \+ low obligations — captured by existing archetypes |

## **Assumptions & Limitations**

### **Explicit Assumptions**

1. BSP≈FIES≈BUDI-user equivalence: Archetype segmentation from BSP CFS (behavioral/attitudinal) is mapped to FIES NCR (financial numerical) as if both describe the same population. In reality, BSP CFS is nationwide (not NCR-specific) and FIES NCR is NCR-specific. Any mismatch between BSP-defined archetypes and FIES-derived income/expense profiles is a threat to validity, not a confirmed equivalence.  
2. Household-to-individual disaggregation: FIES data is household-aggregate; BUDI targets individual users. Per-capita disaggregation assumes roughly even income/expense distribution within households, which is known to be imperfect.  
3. Temporal mismatch: BSP CFS is 2021; FIES NCR is 2023\. Income and expense levels may have shifted due to inflation and economic changes. The 2-year gap is accepted as unavoidable given data availability.  
4. Behavioral features are injected, not observed: Emergency fund adequacy, deposit account ownership, debt levels, credit card ownership, financial risk tolerance, and digital financial services usage are assigned to archetypes based on BSP aggregate statistics, not observed in FIES microdata. Any performance gap between Tier 1 and learned classifiers is only as trustworthy as these injection rules.  
5. Archetype count is fixed at 12: The 8 canonical \+ 4 edge-case roster is a design decision, not an empirical finding. Additional archetypes may be needed if BSP segmentation reveals groups not captured by the current 12\.

### **Limitations**

1. BSP CFS is nationwide; FIES data is NCR-only. Archetype behavioral patterns are drawn from nationwide data but applied to NCR-specific financial profiles. Urban/rural differences in financial behavior may not transfer cleanly.  
2. FIES does not capture behavioral/attitudinal data. Fields like "emergency fund adequacy" or "financial risk tolerance" are not available in FIES and must be injected from BSP statistics or expert judgment.  
3. Archetype assignment is deterministic, not probabilistic. Each synthetic persona is assigned to exactly one archetype. In reality, individuals may exhibit mixed behaviors across archetypes.  
4. Income disaggregation is simplified. Per-capita income is a crude proxy; household income distribution is typically skewed (primary earners receive more). The pipeline does not model intra-household income distribution.  
5. Savings rate is computed from FIES aggregates. FIES reports total income and total expenditure; savings is derived as the residual. This does not distinguish between voluntary savings and forced savings (e.g., mandatory contributions).

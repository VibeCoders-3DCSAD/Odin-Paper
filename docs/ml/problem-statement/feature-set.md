# **Final Feature Set**

This document defines the final feature set for all three BUDI models:

1. **PFP Classifier** — 8-class financial behavior classification (3 binary dimensions)  
2. **Forecaster** — Monthly spending prediction  
3. **Anomaly Detector** — Unusual transaction detection

Features are derived from:

- **FIES 2023 data dictionary** (\~90 variables, 405 columns)  
- **RRL benchmarked algorithms** (XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM, etc.)

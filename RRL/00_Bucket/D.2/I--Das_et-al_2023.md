Abstract

Recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs)  are  neural  network  architectures  with  hidden  state  and  which  use
feedback  loops  to  process  a  sequence  of  data  that  ultimately  informs  the  ﬁnal  output.  Therefore,  RNN
models  can  recognize  sequential  characteristics  in  the  data  and  help  to  predict  the  next  likely  data  point  in
the  data  sequence.  Leveraging  the  power  of  sequential  data  processing,  RNN  use  cases  tend  to  be

architectures  have  been  introduced  in  the  ﬁeld,  starting  from  SimpleRNN  and  LSTM  to  deep  RNN,  and
applied  in  different  experimental  settings.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  present  six  distinct  RNN  architectures  and

Introduction

Recurrent  neural  network  (RNN)  is  a  specialized  neural  network
with  feedback  connection  for  processing  sequential  data  or  time-
series  data  in  which  the  output  obtained  is  fed  back  into  it  as  input
along  with  the  new  input  at  every  time  step.  The  feedback  connec-
tion  allows  the  neural  network  to  remember  the  past  data  when
processing  the  next  output.  Such  processing  can  be  deﬁned  as  a
recurring  process,  and  hence  the  architecture  is  also  known  as
recurring  neural  network.

RNN  concept  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by  Rumelhart  et  al.  [1] in a
letter  published  by  Nature  in  1986  to  describe  a  new  learning
procedure  with  a  self-organizing  neural  network.  Another  impor-
tant  historical  moment  for  RNNs  is  the  (re-)discovery  of  Hopﬁeld

networks  which  is  a  special  kind  of  RNN  with  symmetric  connec-
tions  where  the  weight  from  one  node  to  another  and  from  the
latter  to  the  former  are  the  same  (symmetric).  The  Hopﬁeld  net-
work  [2]  is  fully  connected,  so  every  neuron’s  output  is  an  input  to
all  the  other  neurons,  and  updating  of  nodes  happens  in  a  binary
way  (0/1).  These  types  of  networks  were  speciﬁcally  designed  to
simulate  the  human  memory.

The  other  types  of  RNNs  are  input-output  mapping  networks,
which  are  used  for  classiﬁcation  and  prediction  of  sequential  data.
In  1993,  Schmidhuber  et  al.  [3]  demonstrated  credit  assignment
across  the  equivalent  of  1,200  layers  in  an  unfolded  RNN  and
revolutionized  sequential  modeling.  In  1997,  one  of  the  most
popular  RNN
short-term  memory
(LSTM)  network  which  can  process  long  sequences,  was  proposed.
In  this  chapter,  we  summarize  the  six  most  popular  contempo-
rary  RNN  architectures  and  their  variations  and  highlight  the  pros
and  cons  of  each.  We  also  discuss  real-life  tips  and  tricks  for  training
the  RNN  models,  including  various  skip  connections  and  gradient
clipping.  Finally,  we  highlight  four  popular  language  modeling
applications  of  the  RNN  models  –text  classiﬁcation,  summariza-
tion,  machine  translation,  and  image-to-text  translation–  thereby

2  Popular  RNN  Architectures

2.1  SimpleRNN

In  addition  to  the  SimpleRNN  architecture,  many  variations  were
proposed  to  address  different  use  cases.  In  this  section,  we  will
unwrap  some  of  the  popular  RNN  architectures
like  LSTM,
GRU,  bidirectional  RNN,  deep  RNN,  and  attention  models  and
discuss  their  pros  and  cons.

SimpleRNN  architecture,  which
is  also  known  as  SimpleRNN,
contains  a  simple  neural  network  with  a  feedback  connection.  It
has  the  capability  to  process  sequential  data  of  variable  length  due
to  the  parameter  sharing  which  generalizes  the  model  to  process
sequences  of  variable  length.  Unlike  feedforward  neural  networks
which  have  separate  weights  for  each  input  feature,  RNN  shares  the
same  weights  across  several  time  steps.  In  RNN,  the  output  of  a
present  time  step  depends  on  the  previous  time  steps  and
is
obtained  by  the  same  update  rule  which  is  used  to  obtain  the
previous  outputs.  As  we  will  see,  the  RNN  can  be  unfolded  into  a
deep  computational  graph  in  which  the  weights  are  shared  across
time  steps.

The  RNN  operating  on  an  input  sequence  x(t)  with  a  time  step
index  t  ranging  from  1  to  τ  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The  time  step
index  t  may  not  necessarily  refer  to  the  passage  of  time  in  the  real
world;  it  can  refer  to  the  position  in  the  sequence.  The  cycles  in  the

computational  graph  represent  the  impact  of  the  past  value  of  a
variable  on  the  present  time  step.  The  computational  graph  has  a
repetitive  structure  that  unfolds  the  recursive  computation  of  the
RNN  which  corresponds  to  a  chain  of  events.  It  shows  the  ﬂow  of
the  information,  forward  in  the  time  of  computing  the  outputs  and
losses  and  backward  when  computing  the  gradients.  The  unfolded
computational  graph
equation
corresponding  to  the  computational  graph  is  h(t)  = f(h(t-1) ,  x(t) ;
W),  where  h  is  the  hidden  state  of  the  network,  x  is  the  input,  t  is
the  time  step,  and  W  denotes  the  weights  of  the  network  connec-
tions  comprising  of
input-to-hidden,  hidden-to-hidden,  and
hidden-to-output  connection  weights.

Training  is  performed  by  gradient  computation  of  the  loss  function
with  respect  to  the  parameters  involved  in  forward  propagation
from
followed  by  back-
propagation  moving  from  right  to  left  through  the  graph.  Such
gradient  computation  is  an  expensive  operation  as  the  runtime
cannot  be  reduced  by  parallelism  because  the  forward  propagation
is  sequential  in  nature.  The  states  computed  in  the  forward  pass  are
stored  until  they  are  reused  in  the  back-propagation.  The  back-
propagation  algorithm  applied  to  RNN  is  known  as  back-propa-
gation  through  time  (BPTT)  [4].

The  following  computational  operations  are  performed
in
RNN  during  the  forward  propagation  to  calculate  the  output  and

calculated  recursively  starting  with  the  nodes  preceding  the  ﬁnal

ents  through  time.  tanh  is  a  popular  choice  for  activation  function

2.1.3
Architecture  Variations
Based  on  Inputs  and

Variations  of  SimpleRNN  can  be  designed  depending  upon  the
style  of  graph  unrolling  and  parameter  sharing  [5]:

(cid:129) Connection  between  hidden  units.  The  RNN  produces  outputs  at
every  time  step,  and  the  parameters  are  passed  between  hidden-
to-hidden  units  (Fig.  2a).  This  corresponds  to  the  standard
SimpleRNN  presented  above  and  is  widely  used.

(cid:129) Connection  between  outputs  to  hidden  units.  The  RNN  produces
outputs  at  every  time  step,  and  the  parameters  are  passed  from
an  output  at  a  particular  time  step  to  the  hidden  unit  at  the  next
time  step  (Fig.  2b).

(cid:129) Sequential  input  to  single  output.  The  RNN  produces  a  single
output  at  the  end  after  reading  the  entire  sequence  and  has
connections  between  the  hidden  units  at  every  time  step
(Fig.  2c).

Different  variations  also  exist  depending  on  the  number  of  inputs
and  outputs:
(cid:129) One-to-one:  The  traditional  RNN  has  one-to-one  input  to  out-

put  mapping  at  each  time  step  t  as  shown  in  Fig.  3a.

(cid:129) One-to-many:  One-to-many  RNN  has  one  input  at  a  time  step
for  which  it  generates  a  sequence  of  outputs  at  consecutive  time
steps  as  shown  in  Fig.  3b.  This  type  of  RNN  architecture  is  often
used  for  image  captioning.

put,  at  each  time  step  as  shown  in  Fig.  3c.  This  type  of  RNN
architecture  is  used  for  text  classiﬁcation.

(cid:129) Many-to-many:  Many-to-many  RNN  architecture  can  be
designed  in  two  ways.  First,  the  input  is  taken  by  the  RNN  and
the  corresponding  output  is  given  at  the  same  time  step  as
illustrated  in  Fig.  3d.  This  type  of  RNN  is  used  for  named  entity
recognition.  Second,  the  input  is  taken  by  the  RNN  at  each  time
step  and  the  output  is  given  by  the  RNN  at  the  next  time  step

2.1.4  Challenges  of
Long-Term  Dependencies
in  SimpleRNN

SimpleRNN  works  well  with  the  short-term  dependencies,  but
when  it  comes  to  long-term  dependencies,  it  fails  to  remember
the  long-term  information.  This  problem  arises  due  to  the  vanish-
ing  gradient  or  exploding  gradient  [6].  When  the  gradients  are
propagated  over  many  stages,  it  tends  to  vanish  most  of  the  times
or  sometimes  explodes.  The  difﬁculty  arises  due  to  the  exponen-
tially  smaller  weight  assigned  to  the  long-term  interactions  com-
pared  to  the  short-term  interactions.  It  takes  very  long  time  to  learn
the  long-term  dependencies  as  the  signals  from  these  dependencies
tend  to  be  hidden  by  the  small  ﬂuctuations  arising  from  the  short-
term  dependencies.

To  address  this  long-term  dependency  problem,  gated  RNNs  were
proposed.  Long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  is  a  type  of  gated
RNN  which  was  proposed  in  1997  [7].  Due  to  the  property  of
remembering  the  long-term  dependencies,  LSTM  has  been  a  suc-
cessful  model
recognition,
machine  translation,  image  captioning,  etc.  LSTM  has  an  inner
self  loop  in  addition  to  the  outer  recurrence  of  the  RNN.  The
gradients  in  the  inner  loop  can  ﬂow  for  longer  duration  and  are
conditioned  on  the  context  rather  than  being  ﬁxed.  In  each  cell,  the
input  and  output  is  the  same  as  that  of  ordinary  RNN  but  has  a
system  of  gating  units  to  control  the  ﬂow  of  information.  Figure  4
shows  the  ﬂow  of  the  information  in  LSTM  with  its  gating  units.
There  are  three  gates  in  the  LSTM—the  external  input  gate,
the  forget  gate,  and  the  output  gate.  The  forget  gate  at  time  t  and
ðtÞ
state  si  (f
i  )  decides  which  information  should  be  removed  from
the  cell  state.  The  gate  controls  the  self  loop  by  setting  the  weight
between  0  and  1  via  a  sigmoid  function  σ.  When  the  value  is  near  to
1,  the  information  of  the  past  is  retained,  and  if  the  value  is  near  to

2.3  Gated  Recurrent
Unit  (GRU)

In  LSTM,  the  computation  time  is  large  as  there  are  a  lot  of
parameters  involved  during  back-propagation.  To  reduce  the  com-
putation  time,  gated  recurrent  unit  (GRU)  was  proposed  in  the
year  2014  by  Cho  et  al.  with  less  gates  than  in  LSTM  [8].  The
functionality  of  the  GRU  is  similar  to  that  of  LSTM  but  with  a
modiﬁed  architecture.  The  representation  diagram  for  GRU  can  be
found  in  Fig.  5.  Like  LSTM,  GRU  also  solves  the  vanishing  and
exploding  gradient  problem  by  capturing  the  long-term  dependen-
cies  with  the  help  of  gating  units.  There  are  two  gates  in  GRU,  the
reset  gate  and  the  update  gate.  The  reset  gate  determines  how
much  of  the  past  information  it  needs  to  forget,  and  the  update
gate  determines  how  much  of  the  past  information  it  needs  to  carry
forward.

When  the  reset  gate  value  is  close  to  0,  the  previous  hidden
state  value
is  discarded  and  reset  with  the  present  value.  This
enables  the  hidden  state  to  forget  the  past  information  that  is
irrelevant  for  future.  The  update  gate  determines  how  much  of
the  relevant  past  information  to  carry  forward  for  future.

The  property  of  the  update  gate  to  carry  forward  the  past
information  allows  it  to  remember  the  long-term  dependencies.
For  short-term  dependencies,  the  reset  gate  will  be  frequently
active  to  reset  with  current  values  and  remove  the  previous  ones,
while,  for  long-term  dependencies,  the  update  gate  will  be  often
active  for  carrying  forward  the  previous  information.

The  LSTM  and  GRU  can  handle  the  vanishing  gradient  issue  of
SimpleRNN  with  the  help  of  gating  units.  The  LSTM  and  GRU
have  the  additive  feature  that  they  retain  the  past  information  by
adding  the  relevant  past  information  to  the  present  state.  This
additive  property  makes  it  possible  to  remember  a  speciﬁc  feature
in  the  input  for  longer  time.  In  SimpleRNN,  the  past  information
loses  its  relevance  when  new  input  is  seen.  In  LSTM  and  GRU,  any
important  feature  is  not  overwritten  by  new  information.  Instead,  it
is  added  along  with  the  new  information.

There  are  a  few  differences  between  LSTM  and  GRU  in  terms  of
gating  mechanism  which  in  turn  result  in  differences  observed  in
the  content  generated.  In  LSTM  unit,  the  amount  of  the  memory
content  to  be  used  by  other  units  of  the  network  is  regulated  by  the
output  gate,  whereas  in  GRU,  the  full  content  that  is  generated  is
exposed  to  other  units.  Another  difference  is  that  the  LSTM  com-
putes  the  new  memory  content  without  controlling  the  amount  of
previous  state  information  ﬂowing.  Instead,  it  controls  the  new
memory  content  that  is  to  be  added  to  the  network.  On  the  other
hand,  the  GRU  controls  the  ﬂow  of  the  past  information  when
computing  the  new  candidate  without  controlling  the  candidate
activation.

In  SimpleRNN,  the  output  of  a  state  at  time  t  only  depends  on  the
information  of  the  past  x(1) , .. . .,  x (t-1)  and  the  present  input  x(t) .
However,  for  many  sequence-to-sequence  applications,  the  present
state  output  depends  on  the  whole  sequence  information.  For
example,  in  language  translation,  the  correct  interpretation  of  the
current  word  depends  on  the  past  words  as  well  as  the  next  words.
To  overcome  this  limitation  of  SimpleRNN,  bidirectional  RNN
(BRNN)  was  proposed  by  Schuster  and  Paliwal
in  the  year

2.5  Deep  RNN

Deep  models  are  more  efﬁcient  than  their  shallow  counterparts,
and,  with  the  same  hypothesis,  deep  RNN  was  proposed  by
Pascanu  et  al.  in  2014  [10].  In  “shallow”  RNN,  there  are  generally
three  blocks  for  computation  of  parameters:  the  input  state,  the
hidden  state,  and  the  output  state.  These  blocks  are  associated  with
a  single  weight  matrix  corresponding  to  a  shallow  transformation
which  can  be  represented  by  a  single-layer  multilayer  perceptron
(MLP).  In  deep  RNN,  the  state  of  the  RNN  can  be  decomposed
into  multiple  layers.  Figure  7  shows  in  general  a  deep  RNN  with
multiple  deep  MLPs.  However,  different  types  of  depth  in  an  RNN
can  be  considered  separately
input-to-hidden,  hidden-to-
like
hidden,  and  hidden-to-output  layer.  The  lower  layer  in  the  hierar-
chy  can  transform  the  input  into  an  appropriate  representation  for
higher  levels  of  hidden  state.  In  hidden-to-hidden  state,  it  can  be
constructed  with  a  previous  hidden  state  and  a  new  input.  This
introduces  additional  non-linearity
the  architecture  which
becomes  easier  to  quickly  adapt  changing  modes  of  the  input.  By
introducing  deep  MLP  in  hidden-to-output  state  makes  the  layer
compact  which  helps  in  summarizing  the  previous  inputs  and  helps
in  predicting  the  output  easily.  Due  to  the  deep  MLP  in  the  RNN
architecture,

Encoder–

2.6
Decoder

Encoder–decoder  architecture  was  proposed  by  Cho  et  al.  (2014)
[8]  to  map  a  variable  length  input  sequence  to  a  variable  length
output  sequence.  Therefore,
is  also  known  as  sequence-to-
it
sequence  architecture.  Before  encoder–decoder  was  introduced,
there  were  RNN  models  which  were  used
for  sequence-to-
sequence  applications,  but  they  had  limitations  as  the  input  and
output  sequences  had  to  have  the  same  length.  Encoder–decoder
was  used  for  addressing  variable  length  sequence-to-sequence  pro-
blems  such  as  machine  translation  or  speech  recognition  where  the
input  sequence  and  output  sequence  lengths  may  not  be  the  same
in  most  of  the  cases.  Encoder  and  decoder  are  both  RNNs  where
the  encoder  RNN  encodes  the  whole  input  X  = x ð1Þ,  . . .::, x ðnx Þ
into  a  context  vector  c  and  outputs  the  context  vector  c  which  is
fed  as  an  input  to  the  decoder  RNN.  The  decoder  RNN  generates
an  output  sequence  Y  = y ð1Þ,  . . .::, y ðny Þ.  In  the  encoder–decoder
model,  the  input  length  xðnx Þ  and  the  output  length  y ðny Þ  can  be
different  unlike  the  previous  RNN  models.  The  number  of  hidden
layers  in  encoder  and  decoder  are  not  necessarily  be  the  same.  The
limitation  of  this  architecture  is  that  it  fails  to  properly  summarize  a

128

long  sequence  if  the  context  vector  is  too  small.  This  problem  was
solved  by  Bahdanau  et  al.  (2015)  [11]  by  making  the  context  vector
a  variable  length  sequence  with  added  attention  mechanism.

2.7  Attention  Models
(Transformers)

to

Due  to  the  sequential
learning  mechanism,  the  context  vector
generated  by  the  encoder  (see  Subheading  2.6)  is  more  focused
on  the  later  part  of  the  sequence  than  on  the  earlier  part.  An
the  encoder–decoder  model  was  proposed  by
extension
Bahdanau  et  al.  [11]  for  machine  translation  where  the  model
generates  each  word  based  on  the  most  relevant  information  in
the  source  sentence  and  previously  generated  words.  Unlike  the
previous  encoder–decoder  model  where  the  whole  input  sequence
is  encoded  into  a  single  context  vector,  this  extended  encoder–
decoder  model  learns  to  give  attention  to  the  relevant  words  pres-
ent
in  the
sequence  by  encoding  the  input  sequence  into  sequences  of  vectors
and  chooses  selectively  while  decoding  each  word.  This  mechanism
of  paying  attention  to  the  relevant  information  that  are  related  to
each  word  is  known  as  attention  mechanism.

in  the  source  sequence  regardless  of  the  position

Although  this  model  solves  the  problem  for  ﬁxed-length  con-
text  vectors,  the  sequential  decoding  problem  still  persists.  To
decode  the  sequence  in  less  time  by  introducing  parallelism,  self-
attention  was  proposed  by  Google  Brain  team,  Ashish  Vaswani  et  al.
[12].  They  invented  the  Transformer  model  which  is  based  on  self-
attention  mechanism  and  was  designed  to  reduce  the  computation
time.  It  computes  the  representation  of  a  sequence  that  relates  to
different  positions  of  the  same  sequence.  The  self-attention  mech-
anism  was  embedded  in  the  Transformer  model.  The  Transformer
model  has  a  stack  of  six  identical  layers  each  for  encoding  the
sequence  and  decoding  the  sequence  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  8.  Each
layer  of  the  encoder  and  decoder  has  sub-layers  comprising  multi-
head  self-attention  mechanisms  and  position-wise  fully  connected
layers.  There  is  a  residual  connection  around  the  two  sub-layers
followed  by  normalization.  In  addition  to  the  two  sub-layers,  there
is  a  third  layer  in  the  decoder  that  performs  multi-head  attention
over  the  output  of  the  encoder  stack.  In  the  decoder,  the  multi-
head  attention  is  masked  to  prevent  the  position  from  attending  the
later  part  of  the  sequence.  This  ensures  that  the  prediction  for  a
position  p  depends  only  on  the  positions  less  than  p  in  the  sequence.
The  attention  function  can  be  described  as  mapping  a  query  and
key-value  pairs  to  an  output.  All  the  parameters  involved  in  the
computation  are  all  vectors.  To  calculate
the  output,  scalar
dot  product  operation  is  performed  on  the  query  and  all  keys,
and  divide  each  key  by
is  the  dimension  on
it  to  obtain  the

Tips  and  Tricks  for  RNN  Training

As  previously  stated,  the  vanishing  gradient  and  exploding  gradient
problems  are  well-known  concerns  when
it  comes  to  properly
training  RNN  models  [13,  14].  The  fundamental  challenge  arises
from  the  fact  that  RNNs  can  be  naturally  unfolded,  allowing  their
recurrent  connections  to  perform  feedforward  calculations,  which
result  in  an  RNN  with  the  same  number  of  layers  as  the  number  of
elements  in  the  sequence.  Two  major  issues  arise  as  a  result:

130

Susmita Das et al.

3.1  Skip  Connection

(cid:129) Gradient  vanishing  problem.  It  becomes  difﬁcult  to  effectively
learn  long-term  dependencies  in  sequences  due  to  the  gradient
vanishing  problem  [6].  As  a  result,  a  prospective  model  predic-
tion  will  be  essentially  unaffected  by  earlier  layers.

(cid:129) Exploding  gradient  problem.  Adding  more  layers  to  the  network
ampliﬁes  the  effect  of  large  gradients,  increasing  the  risk  of  a
learning  derailment  since  signiﬁcant  changes  to  the  network
weights  can  be  performed  at  each  step,  potentially  causing  the
gradients  to  blow  out  exponentially.  In  fact,  weights  that  are
closer  to  the  input  layer  will  obtain  larger  updates  than  weights
that  are  closer  to  the  output  layer,  and  the  network  may  become
unable  to  learn  correlations  between  temporally  distant  events.

To  overcome  these  limitations,  we  need  to  create  solutions  so
that  the  RNN  model  can  work  on  various  time  scales,  with  some
sections  operating  on  ﬁne-grained  time  scales  and  handling  small
details  and  others  operating  on  coarse  time  scales  and  efﬁciently
transferring  information  from  the  distant  past  to  the  present.  In  this
section,  we  discuss  several  popular  strategies  to  tackle  these  issues.

The  practice  of  skipping  layers  effectively  simpliﬁes  the  network  by
using  fewer  direct  connected  layers  in  the  initial  training  stages.
This  speeds  learning  by  reducing  the  impact  of  vanishing  gradients,
as  there  are  fewer  layers  to  propagate  through.  As  the  network
learns  the  feature  space  during  the  training  phase,  it  gradually
restores  the  skipped  layers.  Lin  et  al.  [15]  proposed  the  use  of
such  skip  connections,  which  follows  from  the  idea  of  incorporating
delays  in  feedforward  neural  networks  from  Lang  et  al.  [16].  Con-
ceptually,  skip  connections  are  a  standard  module  in  deep  architec-
tures  and  are  commonly  referred  to  as  residual  networks,  as
described  by  He  et  al.  [17].  They  are  responsible  to  skip  layers  in
the  neural  network  and  feeding  the  output  of  one  layer  as  the  input
to  the  next  layers.  This  technique  is  used  to  allow  gradients  to  ﬂow
through  a  network  directly,  without  passing  through  non-linear
activation  functions,  and  it  has  been  empirically  proven  that  these
additional  steps  are  often  beneﬁcial  for  the  model  convergence
[17].  Skip  connections  can  be  used  through  the  non-sequential
layer  in  two  fundamental  ways  in  neural  networks:
(cid:129) Additive  Skip  Connections.  In  this  type  of  design,  the  data
from  early  layers  is  transported  to  deeper  layers  via  matrix  addi-
tion,  causing  back-propagation
to  be  done  via  addition
(Fig.  9b).  This  procedure  does  not  require  any  additional  para-
meters  because  the  output  from  the  previous  layer  is  added  to
the  layer  ahead.  One  of  the  most  common  techniques  used  in
this  type  of  architecture  is  to  stack  the  skip  residual  blocks
together  and  use  an  identity  function  to  preserve  the  gradient
[18].  The  core  concept  is  to  use  a  vector  addition  to  back-

sum  of  the  output  of  previous  layer  and  skip  connection

propagate  through  the  identity  function.  The  gradient  is  then
simply  multiplied  by  one,  and  its  value  is  preserved  in  the  earlier
layers.

(cid:129) Concatenative  Skip  Connections.  Another  way  for  establish-
ing  skip  connections  is  to  concatenate  previous  feature  maps.
The  aim  of  concatenation  is  to  leverage  characteristics  acquired
in  prior  layers  to  deeper  layers.  In  addition,  concatenating  skip
connections  provides  an  alternate  strategy  for  assuring  feature
reusability  of  the  same  dimensionality  from  prior  layers  without
the  need  to  learn  duplicate  maps.  Figure  9(a)  illustrates  a  dia-
gram  example  of  how  the  architecture  looks  like.  The  primary
concept  of  the  architecture  is  to  allow  subsequent  layers  to  reuse
intermediary  representations,  allowing  them  to  maintain  more
information  and  enhance  long-term  dependency  performance.

3.2

Leaky  Units

One  of  the  major  challenges  when  training  RNNs  is  capturing
long-term  dependencies  and  efﬁciently  transferring  information
from  distant  past  to  present.  An  effective  method  to  obtain  coarse
time  scales  is  to  employ  leaky  units  [19],  which  are  hidden  units
with  linear  self-connections  and  a  weight  on  the  connections  that  is
close  to  one.  In  a  leaky  RNN,  hidden  units  are  able  to  access  values
from  prior  states  and  can  be  utilized  to  obtain  temporal  representa-
tions.  Formula  ht = α  ht-1 + (1 - α)  ht  expresses  the  state  update

3.3  Clipping
Gradients

rule  of  a  leaky  unit,  where  α ∈ (0,  1)  is  an  example  of  a  linear  self-
connection  from  ht-1  to  ht,  and  it  is  a  parameter  to  be  learned
during  the  training  stage.  Essentially,  α  controls  the  information
ﬂow  in  the  state.  When  α  is  near  one,  the  state  is  almost  unchanged,
and  information  about  the  past  is  retained  for  a  long  time,  and
when  α  is  close  to  zero,  the  information  about  the  past  is  rapidly
discarded,  and  the  state  is  largely  replaced  by  a  new  state  ht.

Gradient  clipping  is  a  technique  that  tries  to  overcome  the  explod-
ing  gradient  problem  in  RNN  training,  by  constraining  gradient
norms  (element-wise)  to  a  predetermined  minimum  or  maximum
threshold  value  since  the  exploding  gradients  are  clipped  and  the
optimization  begins  to  converge  to  the  minimum  point.  Gradient
clipping  can  be  used  in  two  fundamental  ways:

(cid:129) Clipping-by-value.  Using  this  technique,  we  deﬁne  a  minimum
clip  value  and  a  maximum  clip  value.  If  a  gradient  exceeds  the
threshold  value,  we  clip  the  gradient  to  the  maximum  threshold.
If  the  gradient  is  less  than  the  lower  limit  of  the  threshold,  we
clip  the  gradient  to  the  minimum  threshold.

(cid:129) Clipping-by-norm.  The

idea  behind  this  technique

is  very
similar  to  clipping-by-value.  The  key  difference  is  that  we  clip
the  gradients  by  multiplying  the  unit  vector  of  the  gradients  with
the  threshold.  Gradient  descent  will  be  able  to  behave  properly
even  if  the  loss  landscape  of  the  model  is  irregular  since  the
weight  updates  will  also  be  rescaled.  This  signiﬁcantly  reduces
the  likelihood  of  an  overﬂow  or  underﬂow  of  the  model.

4  RNN  Applications  in  Language  Modeling

Language  modeling  is  the  process  of  learning  meaningful  vector
representations  for  language  or  text  using  sequence  information
and  is  generally  trained  to  predict  the  next  token  or  word  given  the
input  sequence  of  tokens  or  words.  Bengio  et  al.  [20]  proposed  a
framework  for  neural  network-based  language  modeling.  RNN
architecture  is  particularly  suited  to  processing  free-ﬂowing  natural
language  due  to  its  sequential  nature.  As  described  by  Mikolov  et  al.
[21],  RNNs  can  learn  to  compress  a  whole  sequence  as  opposed  to
feedforward  neural  networks  that  compress  only  a  single  input
item.  Language  modeling  can  be  an  independent  task  or  be  part
of  a  language  processing  pipeline  with  downstream  prediction  or
classiﬁcation  task.  In  this  section,  we  will  discuss  applications  of
RNN  for  various  language  processing  tasks.

Many  interesting  real-world  applications  concerning  language  data
can  be  modeled  as  text  classiﬁcation.  Examples  include  sentiment
classiﬁcation,  topic  or  author  identiﬁcation,  and  spam  detection
from  marketing  to  query-answering
with  applications  ranging
[22,  23].  In  general,  models  for  text  classiﬁcation  include  some
RNN  layers  to  process  sequential  input  text  [22,  23].  The  embed-
ding  of  the  input  learnt  by  these  layers  is  later  processed  through
varying  classiﬁcation  layers  to  predict  the  ﬁnal  class  label.  Many-to-
one  RNN  architectures  are  often  employed  for  text  classiﬁcation.

As  a  recent  technical  innovation,  RNNs  have  been  combined
with  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs),  thus  combining  the
strengths  of  two  architectures,  to  process  textual  data  for  classiﬁca-
tion  tasks.  LSTMs  are  popular  RNN  architecture  for  processing
textual  data  because  of  their  ability  to  track  patterns  over  long
sequences,  while  CNNs  have  the  ability  to  learn  spatial  patterns
from  data  with  two  or  more  dimensions.  Convolutional  LSTM
(C-LSTM)  combines  these  two  architectures  to  form  a  powerful
architecture  that  can  learn  local  phrase-level  patterns  as  well  as
global  sentence-level  patterns  [24].  While  CNN  can  learn  local
and  position-invariant  features  and  RNN  is  good  at  learning  global
patterns,  another  variation  of  RNN  has  been  proposed  to  introduce
position-invariant  local  feature  learning  into  RNN.  This  variation  is
Information  ﬂow

parameter  called  window  size,  allowing  the  developer  to  choose  the
width  of  the  context  to  be  considered  while  processing  text.  This
architecture  has  shown  better  performance  than  both  RNN  and
CNN  on  several  text  classiﬁcation  tasks  [25].

(DRNN)  [25].

Text  summarization  approaches  can  be  broadly  categorized  into
(1)  extractive  and  (2)  abstractive  summarization.  The  ﬁrst  approach
relies  on  selection  or  extraction  of  sentences  that  will  be  part  of  the
summary,  while  the  latter  generates  new  text  to  build  a  summary.
RNN  architectures  have  been  used  for  both  types  of  summarization
techniques.

Extractive  summarization  frameworks  use  many-to-one  RNN  as  a
classiﬁer  to  distinguish  sentences  that  should  be  part  of  the  sum-
mary.  For  example,  a  two-layer  RNN  architecture  is  presented  in
[26]  where  one  layer  processes  words  in  one  sentence  and  the  other
layer  processes  many  sentences  as  a  sequence.  The  model  generates
sentence-level  labels  indicating  whether  the  sentence  should  be  part
of  the  summary  or  not,  thus  producing  an  extractive  summary  of
the  input  document.  Xu  et  al.  have  presented  a  more  sophisticated
extractive  summarization  model  that  not  only  extracts  sentences  to
be  part  of  the  summary  but  also  proposes  possible  syntactic  com-
pressions  for  those  sentences  [27].  Their  proposed  architecture  is  a

combination  of  CNN  and  bidirectional  LSTM,  while  a  neural
classiﬁer  evaluates  possible  syntactic  compressions  in  the  context
of  the  sentence  as  well  as  the  broader  context  of  the  document.

Abstractive  summarization  frameworks  expect  the  RNN  to  process
input  text  and  generate  a  new  sequence  of  text  that  is  the  summary
of  input  text,  effectively  using  many-to-many  RNN  as  a  text  gener-
ation  model.  While  it  is  relatively  straightforward  for  extractive
summarizers  to  achieve  basic  grammatical  correctness  as  correct
sentences  are  picked  from  the  document  to  generate  a  summary,
it  has  been  a  major  challenge  for  abstractive  summarizers.  Gram-
matical  correctness  depends  on  the  quality  of  the  text  generation
module.  Grammatical  correctness  of  abstractive  text  summarizers
has
in  contextual  text
processing,  language  modeling,  as  well  as  availability  of  computa-
tional  power  to  process  large  amounts  of  text.

improved  recently  due  to  developments

Handling  of  rare  tokens/words  is  a  major  concern  for  modern
abstractive  summarizers.  For  example,  proper  nouns  such  as  speciﬁc
names  of  people  and  places  occur  less  frequently  in  the  text;  how-
ever,  generated  summaries  are  incomplete  and  incomprehensible  if
such  tokens  are  ignored.  Nallapati  et  al.  proposed  a  novel  solution
composed  of  GRU-RNN
layers  with  attention  mechanism  by
including  switching  decoder  in  their  abstractive  summarizer  archi-
tecture  [28]  where  the  text  generator  module  has  a  switch  which
can  enable  the  module  to  choose  between  two  options:  (1)  generate
a  word  from  the  vocabulary  and  (2)  point  to  one  of  the  words  in  the
input  text.  Their  model  is  capable  of  handling  rare  tokens  by
pointing  to  their  position  in  the  original  text.  They  also  employed
large  vocabulary  trick  which  limits  the  vocabulary  of  the  generator
module  to  tokens  of  the  source  text  only  and  then  adds  frequent
tokens  to  the  vocabulary  set  until  its  size  reaches  a  certain  thresh-
old.  This  trick  is  useful  in  limiting  the  size  of  the  network.

Summaries  have  latent  structural  information,  i.e.,  they  convey
information  following  certain  linguistic  structures  such  as  “What-
Happended”  or  “Who-Action-What.”  Li  et  al.  presented  a  recur-
rent  generative  decoder  based  on  variational  auto-encoder  (VAE)
[29].  VAE  is  a  generative  model  that  takes  into  account  latent
variables,  but  is  not  inherently  sequential  in  nature.  With  the  his-
torical  dependencies  in  latent  space,  it  can  be  transformed  into  a
sequential  model  where  generative  output  is  taking  into  account
history  of  latent  variables,  hence  producing  a  summary  following
latent  structures.

Neural  machine  translation  (NMT)  models  are  trained  to  process
input  sequence  of  text  and  generate  an  output  sequence  which  is
language.  As

architecture  was  proposed  where  one  RNN  encodes  the  input
sequence  of  text  to  a  ﬁxed-length  vector  representation,  while
another  RNN  decodes  the  ﬁxed-length  vector  to  the  target  trans-
lated  sequence  [30].  Both  RNNs  are  jointly  trained  to  maximize
the  conditional  probability  of  the  target  sequence  given  the  input
sequence.  Later,  attention-based  modeling  was  added  to  vanilla
encoder–decoder  architecture
for  machine  translation.  Luong
et  al.  discussed  two  types  of  attention  mechanism  in  their  work
on  NMT:  (i)  global  and  (ii)  local  attention  [31].  In  global  atten-
tion,  a  global  context  vector  is  estimated  by  learning  variable  length
alignment  and  attention  scores  for  all  source  words.  In  local  atten-
tion,  the  model  predicts  a  single  aligned  position  for  the  current
target  word  and  then  computes  a  local  context  vector  from  atten-
tion  predicted  for  source  words  within  a  small  window  of  the
aligned  position.  Their  experiments  show  signiﬁcant  improvement
in  translation  performance  over  models  without  attention.  Local
attention  mechanism  has  the  advantage  of  being  computationally
less  expensive  than  global  attention  mechanism.

Image-to-text  translation  models  are  expected  to  convert  visual
data  (i.e.,  images)  into  textual  data  (i.e.,  words).  In  general,  the
image  input  is  passed  through  some  convolutional  layers  to  gener-
ate  a  dense  representation  of  the  visual  data.  Then,  the  embedded
representation  of  the  visual  data  is  fed  to  an  RNN  to  generate  a
sequence  of  text.  Many-to-one  RNN  architectures  are  popular  for
this  task.

In  2015,  Karpathy  et  al.  [32]  presented  their  inﬂuential  work
on  training  region  convolutional  neural  network  (RCNN)  to  gen-
erate  representation  vectors  for  image  regions  and  bidirectional
RNN  to  generate  representation  vectors  for  corresponding  caption
in  semantic  alignment  with  each  other.  They  also  proposed  novel
multi-modal  RNN  to  generate  a  caption  that  is  semantically  aligned
with  the  input  image.  Image  regions  were  selected  based  on  the
ranked  output  of  an  object  detection  CNN.

Xu  et  al.  proposed  an  attention-based  framework  to  generate
image  caption  that  was  inspired  by  machine  translation  models
[33].  They  used  image  representations  generated  by  lower  convo-
lutional
last  fully
layers  from  a  CNN  model  rather  than  the
connected  layer  and  used  an  LSTM  to  generate  words  based  on
hidden  state,  last  generated  word,  and  context  vector.  They  deﬁned
the  context  vector  as  a  dynamic  representation  of  the  image  gener-
ated  by  applying  an  attention  mechanism  on  image  representation
vectors  from  lower  convolutional  layers  of  CNN.  Attention  mech-
anism  allowed  the  model  to  dynamically  select  the  region  to  focus
image  caption.  An  additional

model’s  focus  for  generation  of  each  word.  Their  visualization
experiments  showed  that  their  model  was  focused  on  the  right
part  of  the  image  while  generating  each  important  word.

Such  inﬂuential  works  in  the  ﬁeld  of  automatic  image  caption-
ing  were  based  on
image  representations  generated  by  CNNs
designed  for  object  detection.  Some  recently  proposed  captioning
models  have  sought  to  change  this  trend.  Biten  et  al.  proposed  a

[34].  Their  caption  generation  LSTM  takes  into  account  both
CNN-generated  image  features  and  semantic  embeddings  to  the
text  of  corresponding  new  articles  to  generate  a  template  of  a
caption.  This  template  contains  spaces  for  the  names  of  entities
like  organizations  and  places.  These  places  are  ﬁlled  in  using  atten-
tion  mechanism  on  the  text  of  the  corresponding  article.

4.5  ChatBot  for
Mental  Health  and
Autism  Spectrum
Disorder

ChatBots  are  automatic  conversation  tools  that  have  gained  vast
popularity  in  e-commerce  and  as  digital  personal  assistants  like
Apple’s  Siri  and  Amazon’s  Alexa.  ChatBots  represent  an  ideal  appli-
cation  for  RNN  models  as  conversations  with  ChatBots  represent
sequential  data.  Questions  and  answers  in  a  conversation  should  be
based  on  past  iterations  of  questions  and  answers  in  that  conversa-
tion  as  well  as  patterns  of  sequences  learned  from  other  conversa-
tions  in  the  dataset.

Recently,  ChatBots  have  found  application  in  screening  and
intervention  for  mental  health  disorders  such  as  autism  spectrum
disorder  (ASD).  Zhong  et  al.  designed  a  Chinese-language  Chat-
Bot  using  bidirectional  LSTM  in  sequence-to-sequence  framework
which  showed  great  potential  for  conversation-mediated  interven-
tion  for  children  with  ASD  [35].  They  used  400,000  selected
sentences
in  many
cases.  Rakib  et  al.  developed  similar  sequence-to-sequence  model
based  on  Bi-LSTM  to  design  a  ChatBot  to  respond  empathetically
to  mentally  ill  patients  [36].  A  detailed  survey  of  medical  ChatBots
is  presented  in  [37].  This  survey  includes  references  to  ChatBots
built  using  NLP  techniques,  knowledge  graphs,  as  well  as  modern
RNN  for  a  variety  of  applications  including  diagnosis,  searching
through  medical  databases,  dialog  with  patients,  etc.

and  new  architectures  are  being  proposed,  this  chapter  summarizes
fundamentals  of  RNN  including  different  traditional  architectures,
training  strategies,  and  inﬂuential  work.  It  may  serve  as  a  stepping
stone  for  exploring  sequential  models  using  RNN  and  provides
reference  pointers.

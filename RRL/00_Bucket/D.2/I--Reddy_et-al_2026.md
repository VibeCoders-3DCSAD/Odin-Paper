ABSTRACT

The AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform is designed to address the
increasing  complexity  of  decentralized  applications  and  digital  asset
management  systems.  As  blockchain  ecosystems  expand,  users  often
struggle  to  interpret  detailed  transaction  data,  understand  staking
mechanisms,  or navigate  complex on-chain  information.  This platform
leverages  advancements  in  Artificial  Intelligence,  real-time  blockchain
indexing,  and  decentralized  protocols  to  convert  unintuitive  data  into
easily  interpretable  financial  insights  while  maintaining  security  and
trust.  By  utilizing  the  Cardano  network  as  its  foundation,  the platform
provides a research-driven, layered architecture that ensures scalability
and  sustainability  as  separate  principles.  This  platform  represents  a
paradigm  shift
in  wealth  management  and  fiscal  oversight  by
transitioning  from  reactive  reporting  to  predictive  intelligence.  At  its
core,  the  system  utilizes  a  sophisticated  multi-agent  AI  architecture
designed  to  ingest,  normalize,  and  analyze  massive  volumes  of
heterogeneous  financial data.  By  synthesizing  information  from global
market  indices,  real-time  news  sentiment,  and  individual  spending
patterns,  the  platform  constructs  a  360-degree  financial  profile.  It
employs  advanced  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  networks  and
Transformer-based  models  to  forecast  cash  flow  trajectories  and
identify  potential  liquidity  risks  before  they  manifest.  This  proactive
approach  allows  users—whether  institutional  investors  or  private
individuals—to  navigate  volatile  markets  with  a  data-backed  roadmap

I. INTRODUCTION
Financial management currently remains a highly significant challenge
for a vast majority of individuals residing in India, with this issue being
particularly acute and noticeable among the working-class demographic
as well as the broader student population. In recent years, there has been
a  massive  proliferation  and  widespread  adoption  of  various  digital
banking  solutions  and  digital  payment  platforms  across  the  country.
Despite  this  rapid  technological  advancement  in  basic  transaction
capabilities,  a  critical  gap  persists:  most  users  still  completely  lack
access  to  personalized,  highly  affordable  financial  advisory  services.
This  absence  of  accessible  guidance  means  that  everyday  individuals
struggle to find expert systems capable of actively guiding their crucial
savings,  investment,  and  budgeting  decisions  in  a  manner  that  is
specifically  tailored  to  their  unique,  individual  income  profiles.  The
existing landscape  leaves  a  void  where  middle-income  individuals  are

left  without  the  necessary  personalized  financial  advisory  tools  required  to
navigate  their  economic  lives  effectively.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  distinctly
low  level  of  general  financial  literacy  and  a  pervasive  lack  of  awareness
concerning  critical  wealth-building  and
instruments,
including mutual funds, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), and various tax-
saving mechanisms.

tax-management

To directly bridge this substantial gap in the financial services ecosystem, an
AI-powered  personal  finance  platform  named  "Welth"  (stylized  as  Welth)
was conceived and developed as a comprehensive Final Year Project. Welth
is  meticulously  designed  to  function  as  a  fully  unified  platform,  thereby
solving  the  absence  of  a  single  system  capable  of  simultaneously  covering
budgeting,  investment  tracking,  EMI  management,  and  proactive  tax
planning. By consolidating these disparate financial necessities, the platform
brings  together  everyday  financial  tracking,  advanced  AI-driven  advisory
functions,  targeted  investment  recommendations,  comprehensive  loan  EMI
management, and intelligent receipt automation into one single, cohesive, and
user-friendly  web  application.  A  major  differentiating  factor  that  elevates
Welth above standard, generic finance applications is its deep integration of
the  user's  actual,  real-world  transactional  data.  Instead  of  relying  on
generalized  financial  platitudes,  the  platform  processes  this  specific  data  to
deliver  highly  contextual,  real-time  financial  advice.  This  guidance  is
delivered  exclusively  through  a  sophisticated  conversational  AI  interface,
which takes on the persona of "CA Arjun"—an AI specifically modeled after
the expertise and professional demeanor of a Chartered Accountant. Prior to
Welth, users suffered from the total absence of any intelligent, context-aware
chatbot  capable  of  utilizing  their  own  deeply  personal  financial  data  to
generate actionable, bespoke advice.

The  fundamental  motivation  behind  Welth  also  stems  from  the  frustrations
associated  with  time-consuming,  manual  expense  logging,  a  tedious process
that inherently results in poor tracking accuracy over time. Consequently, the
project  established  several  rigorous,  technically  ambitious  objectives  to
completely overhaul the personal  finance  experience. The primary objective
is  the  fundamental  design  and  development  of  a  full-stack,  end-to-end  AI-
integrated personal finance web application. Central to this ecosystem is the
implementation  of  the  conversational  CA  AI  advisor,  powered  by  the
advanced  LLAMA  3.1  model  accessed  via  Groq,  which  continuously
operates  utilizing  user-specific  financial  context.  To  address  investment
oversight, the platform aims to build a live, real-time portfolio tracker capable
of  monitoring  both  stocks  and  mutual  funds  by  pulling  data  directly  from
Yahoo Finance and MFAPI.in. Furthermore, to eliminate the inaccuracies of
manual entry, the system integrates an automated receipt scanner leveraging
the  multimodal  capabilities  of  Google  Gemini  Vision.  Beyond  everyday
expenses,  the  platform  is  designed  to  provide  robust,  mathematical  EMI
calculation  tools,  complete  amortization  scheduling,  and  detailed  loan
payment  tracking  features.  All  of  this  complex  data  is  finally  visualized
through  the  creation  of  a  comprehensive  analytics  dashboard  featuring

determines  whether  this  newly  generated  insight  requires  a  formal  audit
before being presented to the user.

If the system determines that the AI-generated insight requires verification to
maintain  absolute  security  and  trust,  the  workflow  transitions  to  the  final
Masumi  Verification  Layer.  Here,  the  specialized  Masumi  Protocol  takes
over  to  generate  a  secure  cryptographic  proof,  commonly  referred  to  as  a
hash.  To  ensure  permanent,  immutable  record-keeping,  this  cryptographic
proof is recorded directly into the Masumi Audit Log, which utilizes secure
on-chain storage. This ultimate layer guarantees that the intelligence provided
to  the  user  is  not  only  accurate  but  also  cryptographically  verifiable  and
logged.

Figure 1: OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

is  structurally  divided

The  operational  methodology  of  the  AI-Powered  Financial  Insights
Platform  follows  a  highly  systematic  workflow  that  seamlessly
bridges  user  queries  with  on-chain  data  and  cryptographic
into  four
verification.  This  workflow
interconnected  operational  layers,  beginning  fundamentally  with  the
User Interaction layer. In this initial stage, the user submits a natural
language  query  through  the  dedicated  Chat  UI,  asking  specific
financial questions such as, "What are my staking rewards?". Once the
entire  backend  process  concludes,  this  layer  is  also  responsible  for
presenting the final, verified response back to the user, complete with
a transparent audit trail, such as a cryptographic hash, to guarantee the
integrity of the provided information before concluding the process.
To  ensure  the  platform's  responses  are  completely  accurate  and
contextually relevant, the system relies heavily on the Blockchain Data
Access  layer.  During  the  initial  Data  Acquisition  phase,  the  system
actively  retrieves  highly  accurate  and  current  blockchain  data
specifically tied to the user's public wallet address. This operational step
involves fetching live wallet data through a specialized Cardano Indexer
and  meticulously  retrieving  the  user's  exact  staking  status  and  current
balances.  All  of  this  critical  financial  information  is  sourced  directly
from the foundational Cardano Blockchain database to ground the AI's
knowledge in reality.

The core intelligence of the platform resides within the Backend & AI
Reasoning  layer,  where  raw  data  is  transformed  into  actionable
intelligence.  The  process  begins  with  Query  Interpretation,  a  crucial
step  where  advanced  natural  language  techniques  are  deployed  to
accurately  recognize  the  user's  underlying  intent.  The  AI  evaluates
whether the response needs to be grounded directly on-chain, generating
a  general  explanation  if  necessary.  Following  this,  the  Context
Formation  stage  merges  the  original  natural  language  query  with  the
freshly  retrieved  live  wallet  data  to  construct  a  comprehensive
contextual  representation.  This  enriched  context  is  then  processed  by
the AI Reasoning Engine, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM),
which  generates  a  highly  detailed,  grounded  financial  insight  or  a
human-readable summary, such as a transaction overview or a detailed
explanation  of  staking  rewards.  Finally,  an  automated  decision  node

1.1  Problem Statement
The core problem motivating the development of the Welth platform is rooted
in  the  reality  that  financial  management  remains  a  highly  significant
challenge  for  a  majority  of  individuals  in  India,  particularly  among  the
working-class  and  student  population.  Despite  the  rapid  proliferation  of
modern  digital  banking  and  digital  payment  platforms  across  the  country,
most  users  still  critically  lack  access  to  personalized,  affordable  financial
advisory  services  capable  of  guiding  crucial  savings,  investment,  and
budgeting  decisions  tailored  specifically  to  their  individual  income  profiles.
This  ongoing  struggle  is  heavily  compounded  by  a  general  environment  of
low  financial  literacy  and  a  pervasive  lack  of  awareness  regarding  essential
wealth-building  and  management  tools,  including  mutual  funds,  Systematic
Investment  Plans  (SIPs),  and  various  tax-saving  instruments.  Furthermore,
users  suffer  from  the  complete  absence  of  a  single,  unified  platform  that
comprehensively  covers  all  necessary  personal  finance  aspects,  spanning
from everyday budgeting and investment to dedicated EMI tracking and tax
planning.  Existing  commercial  solutions  consistently  fail  to bridge  this  gap;
for instance, while established platforms like Mint and YNAB pioneered the
automated  categorization  of  financial
lack
advanced  AI  advisory  capabilities  and  remain  geographically  restricted
strictly  to  the  US  market.  Similarly,  prominent  Indian  investment  platforms
such  as  Zerodha  Kite  and  Groww  offer  robust  market  access  but  fail  to
integrate everyday budgeting, dedicated advisory, or basic expense tracking.
Consequently,  individuals  are  continuously  burdened  by  time-consuming
manual  expense  logging,  an  outdated  process  that  inherently  results  in  poor
tracking  accuracy  over  time.  Beyond  traditional  fiat  finance,  modern
investors  also  face  the  rapidly  increasing  complexity  associated  with
decentralized  applications  and  digital  asset  management  systems.  As
blockchain ecosystems actively expand, users frequently struggle to interpret
detailed  transaction  data,  understand  intricate  staking  mechanisms,  or
successfully navigate complex on-chain information. Whether engaging with
traditional  domestic  markets  or  decentralized  global  assets,  private
individuals and institutional investors alike are frequently forced to navigate
volatile  environments  by  relying  heavily  on  lagging  indicators  rather  than
proactive  guidance.  Ultimately,  these  varied  technological  and  educational
shortfalls culminate in one primary overarching problem: there is currently no
intelligent,  context-aware  chatbot  or  unified  system  available  that  actually
utilizes a user's own specific, real-world financial data to deliver actionable,
personalized advice.

1.2  Objectives

Welth — AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform

To thoroughly fulfill the core mission of the Welth platform, the project
established a comprehensive set of highly technical and functional goals
designed  to  revolutionize  personal  finance  management.  The  primary
and overarching objective is to fundamentally design and develop a full-
stack,  AI-integrated  personal  finance  web  application.  To  directly
counter the widespread lack of personalized guidance, a key objective is
to  actively  implement  a  conversational  CA  AI  advisor  utilizing  the
advanced  LLAMA  3.1  model  accessed  via  Groq,  which  is  specifically
engineered  to  operate  using  user-specific  financial  context.  Another
major developmental goal is to build a live, real-time portfolio tracker
capable  of  meticulously  monitoring  both  stocks  and  mutual  funds  by
pulling  data  directly  from  the  Yahoo  Finance  API  and  MFAPI.in.
Recognizing the severe friction caused by manual expense logging, the
project  aims  to  develop  an  automated  receipt  scanner  leveraging  the
multimodal  capabilities  of  Google  Gemini  Vision  to  significantly
reduce  manual  data  entry.  Beyond  day-to-day  tracking,  the  system's
objectives  expand  into  long-term  financial  structuring  by  aiming  to
provide
tools,  complete  amortization
scheduling, and detailed payment tracking features. All of this complex,
multi-faceted data must be visualized effectively; thus, a core objective
is  to  create  a  highly  comprehensive  analytics  dashboard  featuring

Beyond traditional fiat systems, the platform's objectives also explicitly
encompass  addressing  the  increasing  complexity  associated  with
decentralized  applications  and  digital  asset  management  systems.  By
leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence, real-time blockchain
indexing,  and decentralized  protocols,  a  critical  objective  is to  convert
unintuitive  on-chain  transaction  data  into  easily  interpretable  financial
insights  while  strictly  maintaining  security  and  trust.  To  ensure  long-
term  viability,  the  platform  aims  to  provide  a  research-driven,  layered
architecture  that  guarantees  both  scalability  and  sustainability  as
separate,  foundational  principles.  This  involves  an  objective  to  ingest,
normalize,  and  analyze  massive  volumes  of  heterogeneous  financial
data  while  synthesizing  information  from  global  market  indices,  real-
time  news  sentiment,  and  individual  spending  patterns  to  construct  a
360-degree  financial  profile.  To  make  this  data  actionable,  the  system
targets  the  employment  of  advanced  Long  Short-Term  Memory
(LSTM) networks and Transformer-based models to forecast cash flow
trajectories  and  identify  potential  liquidity  risks  before  they  manifest.
Finally,  by  utilizing  Natural  Language  Generation  (NLG)  to  translate
complex  algorithmic  outputs  into  high-level  executive  summaries,  the
grand  objective  of  the  Welth  platform  is  to  democratize  access  to
professional-grade  financial  analysis  and  represent  a  paradigm  shift  in
wealth  management  by  transitioning  the  entire  user  experience  away
from traditional reactive reporting and toward a system defined entirely
by predictive intelligence.

the  foundational  automated  categorization  of
financial  transactions.  However,  these  established  commercial  platforms
exhibit notable limitations; most prominently, they completely lack advanced
AI-driven advisory capabilities and remain geographically restricted entirely
to  the  United  States  market.  Conversely,  within  the  specific  context  of  the
Indian financial ecosystem, prominent investment platforms such as Zerodha
Kite  and  Groww  offer  highly  robust  market  access  but  fail  to  integrate
essential,  holistic  personal  finance  features  such  as  everyday  budgeting,
dedicated  advisory  services,  or  basic  expense  tracking  functionalities.  To
address  these  industry-wide  gaps,  recent  academic  research  has  provided
crucial  foundational  methodologies;  specifically,  comprehensive  research
conducted  by  Chen  et  al.  (2023)  focusing  on  LLM-based  financial  advisory
systems  clearly  demonstrated  that  large  language  models  are  highly  capable
of providing accurate, deeply personalized financial guidance. Crucially, this
research  established  that  such  accuracy  is  achieved  specifically  when  these
models  are  actively  augmented  with  user-specific  context  through  the
implementation  of  Retrieval-Augmented  Generation  (RAG)  techniques  or
through  careful,  specialized  prompt  engineering.  Further  validating  the
technological methodologies employed in the Welth platform's architecture, a
study  by  Reddy  et  al.  (2022)  illustrated  that  image-based  Optical  Character
Recognition  (OCR)  designed  for  complex  receipt  processing  can  reliably
achieve an impressive accuracy rate exceeding 92% when utilizing advanced
multi-modal  transformer  models,  such  as  Google  Gemini.  Additionally,

foundational  mathematical  basis  for  the  LSTM  prediction  module  that  is
natively  integrated  into  the  Welth  application.  To  make  the  deployment  of
such  advanced,  computationally  heavy  processing  viable  in  a  real-time,
consumer-facing  web  application,  the  system  strategically  leverages  Groq's
highly  optimized  inference  infrastructure,  which  enables  the  powerful
LLAMA  3.1  70B  model  to  operate  continuously  with  sub-second  response
latency.  Ultimately,  Welth  significantly  differentiates  itself  from  all  prior
academic  work  and  existing  commercial  platforms  by  uniquely  combining

3.  System Architecture

The  Welth  platform  is  engineered  upon  a  modern  full-stack  serverless
architecture  that  comprehensively  utilizes  server-side  rendering  (SSR)  and
API routes, all of which are managed by the Next.js 15 framework. The core
application  is  structurally  designed  around  the  Next.js  App  Router  pattern,
strategically  deploying  React  Server  Components  to  efficiently  handle  data-
heavy  pages  alongside  Client  Components  that  manage  interactive  user
interface  elements.  The  frontend  rendering  and  routing  are  powered  by
Next.js 15 and React 18, while the user interface components are extensively
styled and visualized using a combination of Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and
Recharts to ensure accessible components and dynamic data visualization. To
maintain  strict  security  and  session  management,  the  platform  integrates
Clerk to provide robust JWT-based authentication and OAuth capabilities.

The  integration of  artificial  intelligence  within  the  domain  of personal
finance  has  been  the  subject  of  several  rigorous  academic  studies  and
the  focus  of  numerous  commercial  product  developments.  Early
pioneers in the financial technology sector, specifically platforms such
as  Mint  (developed  by  Intuit)  and  YNAB  (You  Need  A  Budget),

User authentication is seamlessly handled by Clerk, which explicitly provides
session tokens that are rigorously validated by Next.js middleware on every
single  protected  route  within  the  application.  The  system's  relational  data  is
securely  housed  in  a  cloud-hosted  PostgreSQL  database  managed  through
Supabase, with Prisma ORM deployed to handle type-safe database queries,

Welth — AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform

schema  management,  and  database  migrations.  The  database  schema
itself is meticulously designed around a central User model, which is a
Clerk-authenticated  profile  that  maintains  cascading  relations  to  all
associated  financial  entities.  This  core  database  schema  incorporates
multiple  specific  models,  including  Bank/Savings  Accounts  with
balance  and  default  flags,  Transactions  recording  all  income  and
expenses  with  recurring  flags,  customizable  Budgets  with  alert
thresholds,  and
target-based  Savings  Goals  encompassing  target
amounts  and  monthly  calculations.  Furthermore,  the  schema  integrates
detailed  Loan  models
tracking  principal  and  amortization,  an
EmiPayment  model  for  individual  installment  statuses,  and  a  Holding
model for managing stock and mutual fund portfolios with average buy
prices.  The  database  heavily  utilizes  enums  for  strict  data  typing,
defining  specific  constraints  for  Transaction  Types,  Account  Types,
Loan Statuses, and Holding Types among others.

To drive the platform's advanced functionalities, the AI Advisory layer
employs  Groq's  infrastructure,  specifically  utilizing  LLAMA  3.1  8B
and  70B  models  for  conversational  AI,  intent  parsing,  and  investment
advice.  Concurrently,  Google  Gemini  1.5  Flash  powers  the  Vision  AI
for  multimodal  receipt  scanning  and  complex  OCR  extraction.  For
advanced  analytics,  a  dedicated  Python  microservice  utilizing  FastAPI
alongside TensorFlow and Keras hosts the LSTM prediction service for
analyzing  time-series  spending  and  balance  data.  Real-time  financial
market  data  is  dynamically  pulled  using  the  unofficial  Yahoo  Finance
API for live NSE/BSE stock prices and MFAPI.in for live mutual fund
NAVs  and  scheme  searches.  In  terms  of  application  flow,  Server
Actions and API Route Handlers are tasked with fetching data directly
from  PostgreSQL  via  Prisma,  applying  necessary  business  logic,  and
passing  serializable  props  back  to  the  React  Server  Components.
Finally,  Client  Components  take  over  to  handle  all  interactivity,
including  charts,  forms,  and  the  conversational  chatbot,  by  utilizing
React  state  and  standard  fetch()  calls  directed  to  the  API  layer.  The
entire ecosystem is reliably hosted via Vercel for the serverless frontend
deployment  and  Supabase  for  the  database,  with  Arcjet  integrated  to
optionally  provide  essential  rate-limiting,  bot  protection,  and  route

guards.  Background  tasks,  such  as  scheduled  email  alerts  and  recurring
transaction processing, are seamlessly offloaded to Inngest.

3.2  Database Schema

Core Architecture

•  Central  Design:  The  database  is  designed  around  a  central  User
model  that  has  cascading  relations  to  all  of  the  system's  financial
entities.

Key Data Models

•  User:  Acts  as  a  Clerk-authenticated  user  profile  that  is  linked

directly to all of the user's financial data.

•  Account: Tracks bank and savings accounts, storing details like the

balance and a default flag.

•  Transaction:  Records  all  income  and  expense  entries,  noting  the

category, type, and whether it has a recurring flag.

•  Budget:  Defines  a  monthly  spending  limit  per  user  and  includes

specific alert thresholds.

•  Goal:  Manages  target-based  savings  goals,  tracking  the  target
amount, the timeline in months, and the necessary monthly savings
calculation.

•  Loan:  Stores  complete  loan  records,  including  the  principal
amount, interest rate, tenure, calculated EMI, and amortisation.

•  EmiPayment:  Tracks  individual  EMI  installments,  specifically

noting their status as paid, missed, or upcoming.

•  Holding:  Manages  the  user's  stock  and  mutual  fund  portfolio,
recording  the  quantity  held,  the  average  buy  price,  and  the  total
invested amount.

Defined  Enums  To  maintain  strict  data  structures,  the  schema  defines  the
following Enums:

•  Transaction Type: Restricted to INCOME or EXPENSE.

•  AccountType: Restricted to CURRENT or SAVINGS.

•  Transaction  Status:  Restricted  to  PENDING,  COMPLETED,  or

ensure  seamless,  secure,  and  highly  performant  data  processing  from  the

Welth — AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform

moment  a  user  initiates  a  session.  The  entire  operational  sequence
begins  strictly  at  the  security  perimeter,  where  user  authentication  is
comprehensively  handled  by  Clerk.  Clerk  actively  provides  robust
JWT-based authentication, complete with extensive support for OAuth
providers, generating secure session tokens that are rigorously validated
by Next.js middleware across every single protected route. To maintain
absolute data integrity and privacy, all API routes and dedicated server
actions  strictly  begin  with  an  auth()  call,  ensuring
that  any
unauthenticated  requests  immediately  receive  a  401  unauthorized
response.  Once  a  session  is  securely  established,  all  user-owned  data
remains  fundamentally  scoped  by  their  unique  user  ID,  completely
preventing  any  potential  cross-user  data  access  even  if  an  API  route
happens  to  be  called  directly  by  an  external  source.  Following
successful  authentication,  the  backend  architecture  heavily  utilizes
Next.js React Server Components specifically for initial data loading on
pages  such  as  the  dashboard,  effectively  eliminating  the  need  for
loading  states  for  static,  non-interactive
cumbersome  client-side
sections. In these backend environments, dedicated Server Actions and
API Route Handlers are tasked with fetching raw data directly from the
PostgreSQL  database  via
the  Prisma  ORM.  These  handlers
systematically  apply  the  necessary  business  logic  and  cleanly  pass
highly  optimized,  serializable  props  down  to  the  React  Server
Components.

4.  Core Features

The  Welth  platform
integrates  a  massive  array  of  advanced
functionalities  designed  to  automate  and  elevate  personal  financial
management.  At  the  heart  of  the  application  is  the  conversational  AI
advisor known as CA Arjun, which is meticulously designed to emulate
a senior Chartered Accountant with deep expertise in personal finance,
sophisticated  investment  strategies,  and  complex  taxation.  This  central
chatbot  operates  dynamically  across  four  distinct  modes:  CA  Advisor
Mode for holistic financial health analysis and spending reviews; Invest
Mode  for  targeted  stock  and  mutual  fund  recommendations  complete
with specific allocation plans; Tax Mode for detailed advice on Indian
income  tax  (specifically  FY  2024-25)  encompassing  80C,  80D,  and
HRA  deductions;  and  a  highly  efficient  Quick  Add  Mode  that  allows
for natural  language  transaction logging,  such  as  simply  typing  "spent
₹300 on food today". The underlying intent parser leverages the speed
of  LLAMA  3.1  8B  to  instantly  classify  incoming  messages  into  six
specific
investment,
budget_analysis, tax_advice, and general analysis. To minimize latency
during interactions, the user's specific financial context—including their
top  spending
3-month
categories, customized budget, and active goals—is fetched entirely in
parallel with this intent parsing. For more complex inquiries, investment
recommendations  are  generated  utilizing  the  higher  accuracy  of  the
LLAMA  3.1  70B  model,  which  returns  heavily  structured  JSON  data
detailing  specific  fund  names,  precise  allocation  percentages,  required
monthly amounts, expected market returns, comprehensive risk ratings,
and  step-by-step  how-to-start  guidance.  To  further  optimize  platform
performance, a smart response cache utilizing an in-memory Map stores

intent  categories:  add_transaction,  add_goal,

income,  overall  expenses,  savings  rate,

read-only  query  results  to  eliminate  redundant  API  calls,  while  vital  write
operations  like  transaction  additions  strictly  bypass  this  cache  to  ensure
absolute data consistency.

To handle complex debt, the dedicated EMI Calculator and Tracker module
provides  a  highly  interactive  calculator  where  users  can  manipulate  the
principal,  annual  interest  rate,  and  tenure  via  visual  sliders.  The  platform
evaluates  the  standard  reducing-balance  mathematical  formula  $P\times
r\times(1+r)^{\wedge  n}/((1+r)\wedge  n-1)$  entirely  client-side  for  instant
preview  capabilities,  outputting  the  exact  monthly  EMI, total  interest,  and  a
12-month area chart detailing the reducing interest component.

4.2  CA Arjun — AI Financial Advisor

CA  Arjun  is  the  central  AI  persona  of  the  Welth  platform,  designed  to
emulate  a  senior  Chartered  Accountant  with  expertise  in  personal  finance,
investment, and taxation. The chatbot operates in four modes: • CA Advisor
Mode — Financial health analysis, spending review, savings advice

•  Invest  Mode  —  Stock  and  mutual  fund  recommendations  with  specific
allocation plans

• Tax Mode — Indian income tax (FY 2024-25) advice including 80C, 80D,
HRA deductions

• Quick Add Mode — Natural language transaction logging (e.g. 'spent ₹300
on food today')

The  intent  parser  uses  LLaMA  3.1  8B  to  classify  messages  into  six  intent
categories:
budget_analysis,
add_goal,
tax_advice, and analysis. User financial context (3-month income, expenses,
savings  rate,  top  categories,  budget,  goals)  is  fetched  in  parallel  with  intent
parsing  to  minimise  latency.  Investment  recommendations  are  generated
using  LLaMA 3.1  70B  for  higher  accuracy,  returning  structured  JSON  with
fund names, allocation percentages, monthly amounts, expected returns, risk
ratings, and how-to- start guidance.A smart response cache (in-memory Map)
stores read-only query results to avoid redundant API calls. Write operations
(transaction addition, goal creation) always bypass the cache to maintain data
consistency.

4.3  Receipt Scanner

The Receipt Scanner is a core feature of the Welth platform designed to
significantly  reduce  manual  data  entry  and  minimize  friction  in
everyday  financial  management  tasks.  The  automated  scanner  enables
users to conveniently photograph, upload, or drag and drop a bill image
directly  into  the  application.  Under  the  hood,  this  multi-modal
extraction  capability  is  powered  by  Google  Gemini  1.5  Flash,  which
processes  the  receipt  images  utilizing the  @google/generative-ai SDK.
When  an  image  is  submitted,  a  highly  specialized  multimodal  prompt
instructs the vision model to accurately extract critical financial details,
including the total amount, merchant name, purchase date, and specific
item  descriptions.  Furthermore,  the  model  automatically  assigns  a
suggested  expense  category  selected  from  15  predefined  enum  values,
structuring the output entirely in JSON format.Once processed—a task
that  averages  a  highly  efficient  response  time  of  approximately  2.1
seconds—the  extracted  data  is  seamlessly  pre-filled  into  an  editable
review  form,  allowing  users  to  verify  the  information  before  it  is
formally  saved  as  a  transaction  via  the  chat  API.  To  handle  image
uploads robustly, the scanner employs a FormData-based POST request
directed  to  a  dedicated  /api/scan-receipt  route,  which  cleverly  avoids
Vercel's standard 4MB server body limit restrictions. Data privacy and
security  are  strictly  enforced  throughout  this  workflow;  the  base64-
encoded image data is processed entirely in-memory and sent directly to
the  Gemini  API  without  any  intermediate  disk  or  object  storage,
ensuring that only the finalized, structured data is actually saved to the
database.  Finally,  the  system  includes  a  reliable  fallback  error  handler
that  successfully  detects  blurry  or  non-receipt
images,  actively
preventing  application  crashes  in  favor  of  returning  a  graceful,  user-
friendly  error  message.  This  implementation  is  supported  by  research
indicating  that  image-based  OCR  utilizing  multi-modal  transformer
models like Google Gemini can achieve accuracy rates exceeding 92%,
reinforcing the technical reliability of this automated feature.

4.4  Live Portfolio Tracker

to  bring

institutional-grade

The  Live  Portfolio  Tracker  is  a  sophisticated  core  feature  within  the
Welth  platform  designed
investment
tracking  capabilities  directly  to  individual  users  at  zero  marginal  cost.
Through this dedicated module, users are empowered to actively search
for  and  add  specific  NSE  and  BSE  stocks,  as  well  as  various  mutual
fund schemes, directly into their personal financial portfolios. To ensure
that  this  tracking  reflects  real-world  market  conditions,  the  system
dynamically  fetches  live  stock  prices  utilizing  the  unofficial  Yahoo
Finance  Chart  API,  which  operates  efficiently  with  a  short-lived  5-
minute  cache.  Concurrently,  real-time  mutual  fund  Net  Asset  Values
(NAVs)  are  continuously  retrieved  from  the  free  MFAPI.in  service,
utilizing  a  slightly  longer  1-hour  cache  to  optimize  performance.
Because these prices and NAVs are pulled from public APIs at runtime,
the  platform  inherently  protects  user  privacy,  as  no  sensitive  financial
market  credentials  are  ever  required  or  permanently  stored  within  the
system.  As  these  real-time  data  streams  are  ingested,  the  platform’s
backend automatically performs complex computations for every single
recorded  holding—which  the  database  formally  tracks  by  quantity,
average  buy  price,  and  total  invested  amount.  Specifically,  the  system
mathematically calculates the current total value, the absolute Profit and
Loss (P&L), the overall percentage return, the specific day change, and
the critical 52-week high and low metrics for each asset. To maintain a
clean and accurate ledger, any duplicate holdings added by the user are
automatically  merged  by  the  system,  which  then  calculates  a  unified
average  buy  price.  All  of  this  complex,  real-time  data  is  visually
communicated to the user through highly interactive UI elements, most
notably displaying  the  overall  portfolio  asset  allocation via  a  dynamic

Recharts PieChart. Furthermore, the module features a dedicated Analysis tab
that provides users with a comprehensive breakdown of their top gainers and
top  losers,  alongside  a  detailed  asset  class  distribution  that  categorizes
investments  precisely  across  Stock,  Mutual  Fund,  and  ETF  holding  types.
Extensive functional testing of this feature confirmed that NSE stock searches
and  mutual  fund  scheme  queries  successfully  return  accurate  results,
including  precise  scheme  codes  and  critical  price  metrics.  Finally,
performance  evaluations  demonstrated  the  high  efficiency  of  this  serverless
architecture,  successfully  executing  a  parallel  live  portfolio  fetch  for  10
distinct holdings via Yahoo Finance in approximately 1.4 seconds.

4.5  EMI Calculator and Tracker

The EMI module within the Welth platform is comprehensively designed to
provide  two  core,  interrelated  functions  for  robust  debt  management:  an
interactive  Calculator  and  a  detailed  Tracker.  The  Calculator  function
empowers users to input their loan's principal amount, the annual interest rate
expressed  as  a  percentage,  and  the  overall  tenure  in  months  through  highly
interactive  visual  sliders.  To  provide  an  instant  preview  without  server
latency,  the  platform  evaluates  the  standard  reducing-balance  EMI  formula,
expressed  as  $P\times  r\times(1+r)^{\wedge  n}/((1+r)\wedge  n-1)$,  entirely
on the client side. The immediate output of this calculation includes the exact
monthly EMI amount, the total interest accrued over the lifespan of the loan,
and  the  total  payable  amount,  all  of  which  are  visually  supported  by  a
dynamically  generated  donut  chart  comparing  the  principal  versus  interest,
alongside a 12-month area chart detailing the progressively reducing interest
component.

Once a user is satisfied with the calculation, the Tracker function allows them
to save the specific loan directly to the database. This action instantly triggers
the server-side amortisation engine to generate a complete, full amortisation
schedule,  systematically  creating  one  distinct  EmiPayment  record  for  every
single installment. To guarantee data integrity, this entire schedule is written
to the database in a single Prisma nested create call—encompassing both the
primary  loan  and  all  associated  EmiPayments—ensuring  atomic  creation.
During  this  generation,  the  amortisation  engine  meticulously  calculates  that
for each specific installment, the principal component strictly equals the EMI
minus  the  product  of  the  outstanding  balance  and  the  monthly  interest  rate.
Furthermore, the engine intelligently adjusts the final installment to account
for  any  mathematical  rounding  drift  by  forcing  the  remaining  balance  to
strictly  zero.  Consequently,  each
installment
permanently  records  its  specific installment  number,  the  exact  due  date,  the
overall  EMI  amount, the  distinct  principal  and  interest  components,  and the
resulting remaining balance.

independently

stored

The  operational  status  of  these  individual  installments  is  intelligently  auto-
derived by the system, classifying them precisely as UPCOMING for future
payments,  PENDING  if  they  are  overdue  but  currently  unpaid,  MISSED  if
they  remain  overdue  after  a  specific  cutoff,  or  fully  PAID.  To  facilitate
seamless  ongoing  management,  users  can  simply  mark  individual  EMIs  as
paid with a single click, an action which accurately records the exact payment
date  within  the  database.  On  the  frontend  UI,  the  associated  loan  card
provides  a  comprehensive  overview  by  displaying  a  visual  progress  bar,
precise  counts  of  paid,  missed,  and  upcoming  installments,  and  explicitly
highlights  the  next  upcoming  EMI  complete  with  a  convenient  "Mark  as
Paid"  button.  Finally,  rigorous  functional  and  performance  evaluations
confirmed
this  atomic  schedule  generation,
demonstrating  that  creating  a  comprehensive  60-month  EMI  schedule
functions  flawlessly  and  requires  a  minimal  database  round-trip  time  of
merely ~180ms.

4.6  Dashboard Analytics

Welth — AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform

The Dashboard Analytics module serves as the primary visual interface
of the Welth platform, specifically designed to fulfill the core objective
of  creating  a  comprehensive  analytics  dashboard  equipped  with  multi-
dimensional  financial  charts.  Functioning  as  a  holistic  center  for
predictive  analytics  ,  the  dashboard  is  technically  engineered  using
Next.js React Server Components for its initial data loading, a strategic
architectural  choice  that  effectively  eliminates  jarring  client-side
loading  states  for  the  page's  static  sections.  To  guarantee  rapid
performance,
the  dashboard  actively  utilizes  Promise.all()
functions  to  fetch  multiple  database  queries  concurrently,  significantly
reducing  overall  server  response  times.  As  data  is  retrieved,  the  UI
employs  Suspense  boundaries  paired  with  BarLoader  fallbacks,  which
explicitly  allow  for  the  independent,  progressive  streaming  of  distinct
data  sections,  such  as  the  budget,  score,  and  goals.  This  highly
optimized Server-Side Rendering (SSR) approach yields an impressive
initial load time of approximately 420ms to the first meaningful content.
Furthermore,  the  system  architecture  ensures  high  availability;  for
example,  if  the  backend  LSTM  prediction  service  goes  offline,  the
system executes a graceful fallback, allowing the dashboard to display a
secure placeholder rather than experiencing a complete crash.

At  the  center  of  this  interface  is  the  DashboardCharts  client
component, which strategically organizes complex financial data across
three interactive tabs. The first tab, labeled "6M Trend," provides long-
term  visualization  through  an  income  versus  expense  area  chart paired
directly with a monthly savings bar chart spanning a six-month period.
The  second  tab,  "Categories,"  breaks  down  immediate  spending habits
by featuring a Donut chart (or category pie chart) alongside horizontal
progress  bars  that  track  the  current  month's  spending  categorized  by
distinct  expense  types.  The  final  tab,  "Daily,"  offers  a  micro-level
perspective  by  deploying  a  30-day  income  and  expense  bar  chart
complemented by a net flow line chart. To ensure these metrics are both
aesthetically  pleasing  and  easily  interpretable,  all  charts  are  built
utilizing  the  Recharts  library  (specifically  React  client  charts)  and  are
heavily  customized  with  interactive  tooltips,  visual  gradients,  and
intuitive  color-coded  data  keys. Finally,  positioned  immediately above
these  graphical  elements,  the  dashboard  features  quick-reference
summary  stat  pills  that  instantly  display  the  user's  current  month
income,  total  expenses,  and  overall  savings,  enhanced  with  month-on-
month  percentage  change  indicators  to  provide  immediate  context
regarding their financial trajectory.\

Performance testing shows that this parallel fetching and generation
process takes an average of approximately 1.8 seconds to complete

5.  AI Integration Architecture

The  AI  Integration  Architecture  of  the  Welth  platform  is  divided  into  three
primary components that handle distinct processing and analytical workloads:

5.1 Groq Inference

The  platform's  core  intelligence  relies  on  Groq's  Language  Processing  Unit
(LPU) inference engine to handle all conversational and analytical AI tasks.
The  system  strategically  utilizes  two  distinct  model  tiers  depending  on  the
complexity of the operation. The llama-3.1-8b-instant model operates
with  a  rapid  sub-200ms  latency  and  is  tasked  with  handling  intent  parsing,
budget  analysis,  tax  advice,  and  generating  general  CA  responses.  For
operations  that  demand  higher  accuracy  and  specialized  financial  domain
knowledge,  such  as  generating  detailed  investment  recommendations,  the
platform employs the more powerful  llama-3.1-70b-versatile model.
To  guarantee  that  the  AI's  guidance  is  firmly  grounded  in  reality,  all  Groq
inject  structured  user  financial  context,  specifically
prompts  actively
aggregating 3 months of data. Furthermore, the system rigorously enforces its
output  format  through  JSON-only  prompts  that  feature  explicit  schema
definitions,  a  structural  constraint
reduces  model
hallucination and parse errors.

For  multi-modal  data  extraction,  the  platform  integrates  Google  Gemini  1.5
Flash
the
@google/generative-ai  SDK.  The  system  sends  a  specialized
multimodal  prompt  that  explicitly  instructs  the  vision  model  to  return
structured JSON data containing predefined fields alongside specific category
enum  values.  To  maintain  strict  user  privacy  and  security,  the  base64-
encoded  image  data  is  transmitted  directly  to  the  Gemini  API  without
utilizing any intermediate disk or object storage mechanisms. Additionally, a
robust  fallback  error  handler  is  natively  implemented  to  safely  detect  non-
receipt  images;  rather  than  crashing,  the  system  intercepts  the  issue  and
returns a graceful, user-friendly error message.

5.3 LSTM Prediction Service

Advanced predictive forecasting is managed by a dedicated LSTM prediction
module. This operates as a completely separate Python microservice running
on  FastAPI  via  port  8000,  hosting  a  specialized  TensorFlow/Keras  LSTM
model that has been actively trained on time-series financial data. The main
application  interacts  with  this  mathematical  model  through  the  Next.js  API
route  /api/ml/Istm-predict,  which  seamlessly  proxies  requests  to  the

Welth — AI-Powered Financial Insights Platform

microservice.  This  specific  API  route  features  a  critical  graceful
fallback mechanism; if the Python service ever becomes unavailable, it
returns  a  structured  error  response  rather  than  a  fatal  500  crash,
allowing  the  frontend  dashboard  to  simply  display  a  placeholder
without breaking the overall user experience.

6.3 Data  Privacy  :Receipt  images  are  processed  in-memory  and  never
persisted  to  disk  or  object  storage  —  only  the  extracted  structured  data
(amount, category, date) is stored in the database. Stock prices and MF NAVs
are fetched from public APIs at runtime with short-lived caches; no sensitive

The  security  and  privacy  architecture  of  the  Welth  platform  is
rigorously structured across multiple layers to protect sensitive user data
and ensure strict access control. At the foundational level of user access,
JWT-based
the  platform
authentication,  which  also  includes  full  support  for  various  OAuth
providers. To maintain an impenetrable security perimeter, every single
API  route  and  server  action  within  the  application  strictly  begins with
an  explicit  auth() call.  If  a  request  is  unauthenticated,  the  system  is
designed to immediately reject it by returning a 401 response.
Furthermore,  absolute  data  isolation  is  guaranteed  because  all  user-
owned  data  is  perpetually  scoped  by  a  unique  userId.  This  vital
architectural  constraint  actively  prevents  any  possibility  of  cross-user
data  access,  effectively  securing  the  data  even  in  scenarios  where  an
API  route  might  be  called  directly  outside  the  standard  frontend
interface.

To  defend  the  platform  against  malicious  traffic  and  abuse,  Arcjet  is
seamlessly integrated to provide essential, albeit optional, rate limiting
and  bot  protection.  The  developers  implemented  a  sophisticated  null-
guard pattern for this integration; specifically, if the ARCJET_KEY is not
set within the environment, all rate limit checks are gracefully bypassed.
This  design  choice  deliberately prevents  the  application  from  crashing
during  development  or  when  deployed  in  environments  lacking  the
specific  API  key.  However,  when  actively  enabled,  Arcjet  rigorously
enforces  strict  per-IP  request  limits  on  the  application's  most  sensitive
routes,  most  notably  shielding  transaction  creation  endpoints  and  the
computationally expensive AI inference endpoints.

Finally, the platform enforces strict data privacy protocols, particularly
concerning  the  handling  of  user-uploaded  files  and  external  financial
data.  When  users  utilize  the  receipt  scanner,  the  uploaded  receipt
images  are  processed  entirely  in-memory  and  are  never  permanently
persisted  to  any  disk  or  external  object  storage.  Only  the  finalized,
extracted structured data—such as the transaction amount, category, and
date—is actually stored within the PostgreSQL database. Additionally,
live  market  data,  including  stock  prices  and  mutual  fund  NAVs,  are
actively  fetched  from  public  APIs  entirely  at  runtime  utilizing  short-
lived  caches.  Because  of  this  runtime  fetching  strategy,  the  platform
ensures that no sensitive financial market credentials are ever required
from the user, nor are any such credentials stored anywhere within the
Welth system.

6.1 Authentication  :  Clerk  provides  JWT-based  authentication  with
support for OAuth providers. All API routes and server actions begin
with  an  auth()  call;  unauthenticated  requests  receive  a  401  response
immediately. User-owned data is always scoped by userId, preventing
cross-user data access even if an API route is called directly.

7.  User Interface Design

The  User  Interface  Design  of  the  Welth  platform  is  meticulously  crafted  to
provide a highly modern and intuitive user experience, strictly adhering to a
dark-mode-first  design  system  that  is  comprehensively  built  upon  Tailwind
CSS and augmented with ShadCN UI components. To establish a strong and
cohesive  visual  identity,  the  application  utilizes  a  specific  color  palette
anchored  by  a  deep  navy  background,  specifically  utilizing  the  hex  code
#030712.  Against  this  dark  canvas,  the  interface  strategically  deploys  an
emerald  green  accent  (#10b981)  to  clearly  highlight  positive  financial
indicators,  while  simultaneously utilizing  a  distinct  amber gold  (#fbbf24)  to
represent  and  brand  the  CA  Arjun  AI  persona.  Typography  also  plays  a
crucial  role  in  the  platform's  professional  feel;  the  Sora  typeface  is
exclusively selected for all headings and critical financial figures, a deliberate
design  choice  intended  to  convey  a  sense  of  absolute  authority  and
mathematical precision.

Navigation  is  streamlined  through  a  primary  header  that  contains  four
distinct,  color-coded  buttons  to  aid  in  rapid  user  orientation:  the  standard
Dashboard, a gold-tinted CA Report button, a blue EMI module button, and a
green  Portfolio  tracker  button.  To  ensure  continuous  access  to  financial
guidance,  the  "Ask  CA"  conversational  chatbot  is  made  universally
accessible  from  absolutely  all  pages  via  a  fixed  pill  button  deliberately
positioned  just  below  the  main  header.  This  specific  chatbot  button  utilizes
engaging  green  glow  and  continuous  pulse  animations  to  visually  signal  to
the user that the AI is actively available and ready to assist. Furthermore, to
maintain  a  consistent  and  highly  modern  fintech  aesthetic  across  the  entire
application, all internal modals, data cards, and informational panels employ
sophisticated glass-morphism styling, which is characterized by the extensive
use of backdrop-blur effects, semi-transparent backgrounds, and highly subtle
borders.  Finally, to  ensure  maximum  relevance  and  readability  for  its  target
demographic,  all  financial  values  displayed  throughout  the  entirety  of  the
application  are  strictly  localized  using  Indian  locale  formatting,  specifically
utilizing  the  Intl.NumberFormat for  'en-IN'  to  display  the  Indian  Rupee
(INR).

8.  Results and Evaluation

data  containing  3-4  specific  mutual  fund  suggestions,  while  the
specialized  tax  advice  module  accurately  cited  relevant  Section  80C
deductions  complete  with
respective  monetary  amounts.
Furthermore,  the  CA  Report  generation  passed  its  evaluation  by
correctly  computing  a  comprehensive  financial  health  score  between  0
and  100,  which  was  appropriately  accompanied  by  an  assigned  grade
and specific, actionable items.

The  multimodal  receipt  scanner  was  subjected  to  rigorous  testing
utilizing  varying  image  qualities  to  ensure  real-world  viability.  When
processing  clear  photos,  the  module  successfully  extracted  the  correct
total  amount,  merchant  name,  and  appropriate  expense  category.
Crucially, when presented with blurry or non-receipt images, the vision
system  did  not  crash  but  instead  successfully  detected  the  issue  and
returned  a  graceful,  user-friendly  error  message.  The  platform's
complex  financial  calculation  and  tracking  modules  also  performed
flawlessly:  the  server-side  EMI  schedule  generation  successfully
created  all  60  individual  installments  atomically  for  a  simulated  60-
month  loan,  while  the  EMI  mark-as-paid  function  accurately  updated
the  installment's  status  and  successfully  recorded  the precise  paid  date
within the database.

The  live  portfolio  tracking  features  demonstrated  seamless,  highly
accurate  integration  with  external  financial  APIs.  Portfolio  stock
searches  strictly  targeting  the  NSE  correctly  returned  accurate  Yahoo
Finance  results,  and  mutual  fund  searches  successfully  retrieved
MFAPI.in  results  complete  with  the  necessary  unique  scheme  codes.
Additionally,  the  live  stock  price  fetch  function  was  tested  and
accurately  retrieved  the  current  asset  price,  the  specific  day  change
percentage, and the vital 52-week high and low metrics.

Finally,  the  system's  architectural  resilience  and  automated  error-
handling  capabilities  were  strictly  tested  to  ensure  maximum  uptime
and  system  stability.  The  Arcjet  null-guard  security  implementation
successfully  passed  its  evaluation;  when  the  system  was  intentionally

tested without a provided API key, the application continued to run smoothly
without  crashing,  successfully  and gracefully  skipping  the  rate  limit  checks.
Similarly, when the backend LSTM prediction microservice was intentionally
taken offline to simulate a server outage, the system successfully executed a
graceful fallback protocol, ensuring that the primary frontend dashboard did
not crash and the user experience remained entirely uninterrupted.

third-party  services  such  as  Yahoo  Finance,  MFAPI.in,  and
Google  Gemini;  any  downtime  or  changes  to  these  APIs
could  impact  core  features  like  live  tracking  or  receipt
scanning.

•  Connectivity Requirements: As a serverless web application
requiring live blockchain indexing and real-time AI inference,
the platform requires a stable, high-speed internet connection
to function effectively.

•  Experimental Features: Certain advanced components, such
as the LSTM prediction service, are currently implemented as
separate microservices and may require a graceful fallback if
the service is unavailable.

tasks.  In

The development and implementation of the Welth project successfully
demonstrates  that  a  highly  comprehensive,  fully  AI-powered  personal
finance platform can be effectively built and deployed utilizing modern
web technologies in conjunction with publicly available AI APIs. At the
core of this technological achievement is the conversational AI persona,
CA  Arjun,  which  successfully  provides  users  with  highly  contextual,
data-driven financial guidance that significantly surpasses the utility of
standard,  generic  financial  advice.  Furthermore,  the  integration  of
advanced,  automated  features  within  the  platform,  specifically  the
multi-modal  receipt  scanner  and  the  dedicated  EMI  tracker,  actively
succeeds  in  reducing  the  inherent  friction  traditionally  associated  with

capabilities directly to individual users at absolutely zero marginal cost.
From  a  fundamental  technical  standpoint,  the  platform  relies  on  a
strictly  modular  architecture  that  meticulously  separates  operational
concerns  across  dedicated  server  actions,  specific  API  routes,  and
interactive  client  components.  This  deliberate,  separated  architectural
design  successfully  ensures  the  system's  long-term  maintainability  and
technical  extensibility  for  future  updates.  Finally,  the  project  strongly
validates  the  practical  application  of  advanced  inference  hardware;
specifically,  the  strategic  use  of  Groq's  Language  Processing  Unit
(LPU)  infrastructure  successfully  enables  the  delivery  of  real-time  AI
responses. This rapid processing capability is a critical achievement for
the platform, as such low-latency conversational AI interactions would
otherwise  be  entirely  impractical  to  implement  and  sustain  within  a
standard consumer web application.

The  Welth  project  successfully  demonstrates  that  a  comprehensive,  AI-
powered personal finance platform can be effectively built using modern web
technologies  and  publicly  available  AI  APIs.  The  "CA  Arjun"  advisor
provides  highly  contextual,  data-driven  guidance  that  goes  significantly
beyond generic financial advice, while specialized features like the automated
receipt  scanner  and  EMI  tracker  effectively  reduce  friction  in  everyday
financial  management  tasks.  By  integrating  a  live  portfolio  tracker,  the
platform brings institutional-grade investment monitoring to individual users
at zero marginal cost.

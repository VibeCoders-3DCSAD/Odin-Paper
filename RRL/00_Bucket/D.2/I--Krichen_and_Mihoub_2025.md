Abstract

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have revolutionized the field of deep learning,
particularly in applications that require the modeling of sequential data. Originally de-
signed to overcome the limitations of traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs
effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequences, making them suitable for a wide
array of tasks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LSTM architec-
tures, detailing their unique components, such as cell states and gating mechanisms, which
facilitate the retention and modulation of information over time. We delve into the various
applications of LSTMs across multiple domains, including the following: natural language
processing (NLP), where they are employed for language modeling, machine translation,
and sentiment analysis; time series analysis, where they play a critical role in forecasting
tasks; and speech recognition, significantly enhancing the accuracy of automated systems.
By examining these applications, we illustrate the versatility and robustness of LSTMs
in handling complex data types. Additionally, we explore several notable variants and
improvements of the standard LSTM architecture, such as Bidirectional LSTMs, which en-
hance context understanding, and Stacked LSTMs, which increase model capacity. We also
discuss the integration of Attention Mechanisms with LSTMs, which have further advanced
their performance in various tasks. Despite their strengths, LSTMs face several challenges,
including high Computational Complexity, extensive Data Requirements, and difficulties
in training, which can hinder their practical implementation. This survey addresses these
limitations and provides insights into ongoing research aimed at mitigating these issues. In
conclusion, we highlight recent advances in LSTM research and propose potential future
directions that could lead to enhanced performance and broader applicability of LSTM
networks. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners

inability to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This problem arises during the training of RNNs, where gradients diminish
exponentially through time, making it difficult for the network to learn from long sequences
of data.

In response to these challenges, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were
introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 [7,8]. LSTMs are a specialized kind
of RNN designed to remember information for long periods, making them particularly
effective for tasks that require the retention of contextual information over time [9]. Their
architecture incorporates memory cells and gating mechanisms, which regulate the flow
of information, allowing the network to learn which data to keep or discard. This capabil-
ity has made LSTMs a powerful tool for numerous applications, resulting in significant
advancements in various fields.

LSTMs have been successfully applied in natural language processing, where they facil-
itate tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis [10,11].
By maintaining contextual information across sentences, LSTMs improve the quality of
generated text and enhance understanding in conversational agents. In time series analysis,
LSTMs excel at forecasting future events based on historical data, proving invaluable in
industries like finance, healthcare, and meteorology [12,13]. Moreover, in speech recogni-
tion systems, LSTMs have improved the accuracy of automatic speech-to-text conversion,
enabling more efficient communication and interaction with technology [14,15].

Despite their strengths, LSTMs are not without challenges. Training LSTM networks
can be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources and large volumes of
labeled data [16,17]. Additionally, issues such as overfitting and model complexity can
hinder their performance in real-world applications. Researchers continue to explore
various enhancements and adaptations of the LSTM architecture, including Bidirectional
LSTMs that provide context from both past and future inputs, and the integration of
Attention Mechanisms that allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
It is worth noting that this survey follows a narrative (descriptive) review approach,
with the aim of synthesising and thematically organizing the most relevant research on
LSTM architectures and applications rather than conducting a protocol-based systematic
review. In line with this, the review adopts a broad perspective across multiple domains
rather than focusing on a single use-case (e.g., finance or healthcare). The objective is to
provide readers with a comprehensive overview that highlights the commonalities and
differences of LSTM usage, thereby serving as a general entry point into the field. Hence,

2. Fundamentals of LSTM

LSTM networks are a specialized type of RNNs designed to effectively learn long-term
dependencies in sequential data [18]. Traditional RNNs often struggle with the vanishing
gradient problem, which limits their ability to capture information from distant elements
in a sequence. LSTMs address this challenge through their unique architecture and gating
mechanisms. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the LSTM architecture, the
mechanisms that facilitate its functionality, and a comparison with traditional RNNs [19].

2.1. LSTM Architecture and Mechanism

The LSTM architecture is a sophisticated structure designed to manage and preserve
information over long sequences. It consists of several key components that facilitate its
enhanced performance:

•

Cell State (Ct): The cell state serves as the memory unit of the LSTM, carrying relevant
information throughout the sequence. It is updated at each time step, allowing the
LSTM to retain information over long periods. The cell state is crucial for maintaining
context, as it can store information from previous time steps without significant
degradation. This attribute enables LSTMs to remember essential details over long
sequences, making them suitable for applications like language modeling and time
series prediction.

• Hidden State (ht): The hidden state is the output of the LSTM at time step t and is
used for making predictions. It encapsulates information about the input sequence
thus far and is passed to subsequent LSTM cells. The hidden state can be interpreted
as the filtered version of the cell state, representing the relevant information needed
for the current prediction. This dynamic nature of the hidden state allows the model
to adapt its outputs based on the evolving context of the input sequence.
Gates: LSTMs utilize three types of gates to control the flow of information, each
serving a distinct purpose:

•

AI 2025, 6, 215

–

–

Input Gate (it): This gate determines how much of the new information from the
current input should be added to the cell state. The input gate uses a sigmoid
activation function to output values between 0 and 1, effectively acting as a filter.
The formula for the input gate is

it = σ(Wi · [ht−1, xt] + bi).

(1)

A value obtained by Formula (1) close to one indicates that the information should
be fully added to the cell state, whereas a value close to zero implies that little
to no information should be added. Here, it is the input gate activation, Wi is
the weight matrix, ht−1 is the hidden state from the previous time step, xt is the
current input, and bi is the bias term.
Forget Gate ( ft): The forget gate decides which information from the cell state
should be discarded. Similar to the input gate, it employs a sigmoid function:

ft = σ(Wf · [ht−1, xt] + b f ).

(2)

The forget gate obtained by Formula (2) enables the LSTM to remove irrelevant
information, helping to prevent the cell state from becoming cluttered. This
mechanism is essential for maintaining the model’s ability to focus on relevant
patterns over time. In this formula, ft is the forget gate activation, Wf is the weight
matrix, b f is the bias term, and the other variables are as previously defined.
Output Gate (ot): This gate controls what part of the cell state will be output as
the hidden state. It dictates the information passed to the next LSTM cell:

ot = σ(Wo · [ht−1, xt] + bo).

(3)

The output gate calculated by applying Formula (3) ensures that the hidden state
reflects only the most pertinent information from the cell state, which is crucial
for making accurate predictions at each time step. Here, ot is the output gate
activation, Wo is the weight matrix, bo is the bias term, and the other variables are
as defined earlier.

The updates to the cell state and hidden state are governed by the following equations:

˜Ct = tanh(WC · [ht−1, xt] + bC).

(4)

In Formula (4), ˜Ct represents the candidate values for the cell state, WC is the weight

matrix, and bC is the bias term.

Ct = ft ⊗ Ct−1 + it ⊗ ˜Ct.

(5)

In Equation (5), Ct is the updated cell state, Ct−1 is the previous cell state, and ⊗

denotes element-wise multiplication.

ht = ot ⊗ tanh(Ct).

(6)

In Equation (6),

ht is the updated hidden state.
σ is the sigmoid activation function, which outputs values in the range (0, 1).

•
•
• Wf , Wi, WC, Wo are weight matrices, and b f , bi, bC, bo are bias vectors, which are learned

during training.

The architecture of the LSTM cell is visualized in Figure 2, which illustrates the
connectivity between the gates, cell state, and hidden state. To complement this, Figure 3
presents a schematic of three successive LSTM cells across time steps (t − 1, t, t + 1),

the sequence.

To further clarify how long-term information is preserved, we provide a more detailed
explanation of the LSTM gating mechanisms, as each gate plays a crucial role in controlling
the flow of information. The forget gate evaluates the previous cell state and the current
input to decide what information to discard. This selective forgetting is essential to prevent
the cell state from becoming cluttered with irrelevant data, which helps maintain the
integrity of the learning process. The output of the forget gate can be interpreted as a mask
that determines which parts of the cell state should be preserved. The input gate assesses
the new input and the previous hidden state to determine how much new information
to add to the cell state. This gate allows the model to dynamically incorporate relevant
information while ignoring noise, thereby improving learning efficiency. New candidate
values are created using a hyperbolic tangent function, which helps in scaling the new
information and ensures that the LSTM can adapt to new information in a controlled
manner. Finally, the output gate filters the cell state to generate the hidden state, which is
used for predictions and passed to the next time step. This ensures that only the relevant
information is exposed to the output, allowing the model to produce contextually relevant
outputs based on the entire sequence.

2.2. Comparison with Traditional RNNs

To illustrate the advantages of LSTMs over traditional RNNs, we summarize the key

differences in Table 1.

The table highlights that while LSTMs are more complex, they are significantly better at
retaining information over longer sequences compared to traditional RNNs. This capability
makes LSTMs particularly suitable for tasks such as natural language processing, where
context and meaning can span long distances in text. Furthermore, the enhanced learning
capability of LSTMs is attributed to their ability to adaptively learn which information
is relevant over time, whereas traditional RNNs often struggle to maintain this context.
In practical applications, this translates to improved performance in tasks involving long
sequences, such as language translation and speech recognition. The architecture and
mechanisms of LSTMs enable them to effectively manage long-term dependencies, making
them a robust choice for a variety of sequence modeling tasks. The unique properties of
LSTMs have led to their adoption across various fields, demonstrating their versatility and
effectiveness in handling complex sequential data. Although LSTM is a relatively mature
architecture, it is still widely used in both applied and comparative studies due to its proven
effectiveness and the availability of well-established implementations, which make it a
strong and reliable baseline for evaluating more recent sequence modeling techniques.

2.3. Feature Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization

Feature selection (FS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) are central to achieving
reliable LSTM performance, though their relative impact depends on data characteristics
and task constraints [20,21]. Filter-style FS (e.g., mutual-information criteria) helps reduce
redundancy and noise in high-dimensional sequences and has been shown to improve
downstream modeling in time series settings [22,23]. Beyond filtering, representation-
learning approaches such as autoencoders can provide compact, informative inputs for
sequence models, effectively acting as data-driven feature selectors [24]. Attention Mecha-
nisms likewise reweight informative temporal signals and have demonstrated benefits in
multivariate time series forecasting [25].

On the optimization side, modern HPO encompasses Bayesian methods and
evolutionary/population-based search, with recent studies documenting consistent gains
over manual tuning and ad hoc heuristics [20,26]. Practical workflows often combine
surrogate-based search with resource-aware scheduling to explore architectures and train-
ing settings efficiently (e.g., depth/width, look-back window, learning rate, dropout, batch
size) [20]. Crucially, evaluation protocols must respect temporal order to avoid infor-
mation leakage; recent analyses emphasize blocked/rolling validation and warn against
random splits for time series [27,28]. In applied LSTM studies, pairing principled FS with
systematic HPO has yielded measurable accuracy and robustness gains in forecasting
tasks, underscoring the value of treating FS and HPO as first-class components of the
modeling pipeline [29].

3. Applications of LSTM

LSTM networks have gained prominence due to their effectiveness in handling se-
quences and time-dependent data. This section explores various applications of LSTMs
across different domains, highlighting their versatility and impact.

3.1. Natural Language Processing

LSTMs play a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where understanding
context and maintaining long-term dependencies are essential [30]. Key applications include
the following:

•

• Machine Translation [31]: LSTMs are employed in translating text from one language
to another. For instance, Google Translate utilizes LSTMs to process sequences of
words effectively, improving translation quality across diverse languages. The model
captures contextual relationships, allowing it to handle idiomatic expressions and
complex grammatical structures, leading to translations that are not only accurate but
also contextually relevant.
Sentiment Analysis [32–34]: LSTMs analyze sentiments in text data, such as product
reviews or social media posts, and are frequently evaluated on public benchmark
datasets, such as the IMDB movie review corpus. Consider a scenario where a com-
pany analyzes Twitter data to gauge customer sentiment about a new product launch.
By using an LSTM model, the company can accurately classify tweets as positive,
negative, or neutral, enabling it to respond promptly to customer feedback and adjust
marketing strategies accordingly.
Text Generation [35,36]: In applications such as creative writing and chatbots, LSTMs
are used to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, early
text generation systems relied on Stacked LSTM architectures to model long-range
dependencies in language. More recent models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2, are based on
the Transformer architecture but still highlight the importance of sequence learning
for generating human-like text from a given prompt. Businesses can leverage these
capabilities to create automated customer support chatbots that provide accurate and
contextually appropriate responses to user inquiries.

•

• Named Entity Recognition [37–40]: LSTMs help identify and classify entities in text,
such as names of people, organizations, and locations. For example, in healthcare,
extracting patient information from clinical notes is crucial. An LSTM-based model
can accurately identify and extract entities like drug names, dosages, and medical
conditions, facilitating better data management and research.

3.2. Time Series Analysis

LSTMs are particularly effective in analyzing time series data due to their ability to

capture temporal dependencies [41]. Applications include the following:

•

Financial Forecasting [42,43]: LSTMs are widely used in predicting stock prices and
market trends by analyzing historical data. For instance, hedge funds employ LSTM
models to forecast stock prices based on historical trading data, economic indicators,
and news sentiment. By learning patterns from past data, LSTMs help traders make
informed decisions about buying or selling stocks at optimal times.

• Weather Forecasting [44–46]: Meteorological models utilize LSTMs to predict weather
conditions by analyzing historical weather data. An example is using LSTMs to
forecast temperature and precipitation based on past climatic data, enabling more
accurate predictions. This capability is crucial for agriculture, where farmers can better
plan planting and harvesting times based on expected weather patterns.

AI 2025, 6, 215

• Anomaly Detection [47,48]: In fields such as manufacturing and finance, LSTMs can
identify anomalies in time series data, such as fraudulent transactions or equipment
failures. For example, a bank might use LSTMs to monitor transaction patterns and
detect unusual activities that could indicate fraud. The system can automatically flag
these transactions for further investigation, enhancing security and reducing losses.

3.3. Speech Recognition

LSTMs have significantly improved the accuracy of automatic speech recognition

(ASR) systems. Their applications include the following:

•

•

•

Voice Assistants [49]: Technologies like Siri and Google Assistant use LSTMs to
understand and process spoken commands. For instance, when a user asks their voice
assistant to set a reminder, the LSTM model processes the spoken input, maintaining
context across the conversation to provide accurate responses. This enhances user
experience by enabling more natural interactions.
Transcription Services [50]: LSTMs facilitate the conversion of spoken language into
written text. Companies like Otter.ai utilize LSTMs to provide real-time transcription
services for meetings and lectures; in this field, LibriSpeech is one of the most com-
monly used benchmark datasets for training and evaluation. The model can handle
various accents and speech patterns, ensuring that transcriptions are accurate and
contextually relevant, which is invaluable for professionals needing precise records
of discussions.
Emotion Recognition [51,52]: By analyzing speech patterns and intonations, LSTMs
can identify emotional states, which is useful in applications such as mental health
monitoring and customer service. Understanding emotions can lead to improved
user experiences and interactions, as customer service representatives can tailor their
responses based on the detected emotional tone.

3.4. Other Emerging Applications

Beyond traditional applications, LSTMs are being explored in various emerging fields:

•

• Healthcare [53–56]: LSTMs analyze patient data over time, predicting health outcomes
and personalizing treatment plans. For instance, hospitals can use LSTM models to
track vital signs of patients in real-time, predicting potential health deteriorations.
This enables timely interventions that can significantly improve patient outcomes,
such as early detection of sepsis.
Robotics [57–59]: In robotics, LSTMs help in path planning and decision-making
by predicting future states based on past movements and sensory inputs. Consider
autonomous vehicles, which use LSTMs to analyze traffic patterns and make real-
time navigation decisions. This enhances the vehicle’s ability to operate safely and
efficiently in dynamic environments.
Video Analysis [60–63]: LSTMs are used in analyzing video sequences for applications
such as action recognition and event prediction. For example, security systems can
utilize LSTMs to detect unusual activities in surveillance footage. By analyzing
sequences of frames, the system can identify potential security threats, enhancing
safety in public spaces.

•

Table 2 summarizes the various applications of LSTMs across different domains,
highlighting their key features and benefits.
To sum up, LSTMs have shown strong
performance in a variety of application domains. For example, in speech processing and
traffic prediction, their ability to capture temporal dependencies has yielded better results
than traditional machine learning models. In financial forecasting, LSTMs demonstrated
robustness to noisy and highly dynamic sequential data. However, several limitations have

AI 2025, 6, 215

9 of 21

also been reported in the literature. In IoT scenarios, the high training and inference costs
of LSTMs often make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
In healthcare, long and irregular time series sequences frequently cause performance
degradation. Moreover, the limited interpretability of LSTM models has been identified as
a critical issue in safety-critical domains, such as medical diagnosis. These observations
suggest that further improvements are required, particularly to enhance model efficiency,
increase robustness to long and irregular sequences, and integrate interpretability methods
or hybrid architectures (e.g., attention-based extensions) into LSTM models.

4. Variants and Improvements

While LSTM networks have proven to be highly effective for sequence modeling,
several variants and improvements have emerged to enhance their performance in various
applications. This section discusses three significant advancements: Bidirectional LSTMs,
Stacked LSTMs, and Attention Mechanisms. It is worth noting that, unlike the application
section above, this section provides a systematic overview of three main LSTM variants
independently of their application domains, in order to clearly distinguish architectural
differences from use-case specific deployments.

4.1. Bidirectional LSTMs

Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) are an extension of the standard LSTM architecture
that allow the network to learn from both past and future contexts in a sequence [64–67].
In a traditional LSTM, information flows in one direction, typically from past to future.
However, BiLSTMs process the input sequence in both forward and backward directions:

AI 2025, 6, 215

10 of 21

•

•

Architecture: A BiLSTM consists of two LSTM layers for each time step: one processes
the sequence from the beginning to the end (forward) and the other processes it from
the end to the beginning (backward). The outputs of both layers are concatenated or
combined, providing a richer representation that captures context from both sides.
This architecture is particularly useful in scenarios where the context surrounding a
word is critical for understanding its meaning.
Example: In a sentence like “The bank of the river,” understanding the word “bank”
requires context from both directions to determine whether it refers to a financial
institution or the side of a river. A BiLSTM uses the forward layer to gather context
from preceding words and the backward layer to gather context from subsequent
words, enhancing its ability to disambiguate meaning effectively.

• Applications: This approach is particularly useful in tasks such as named entity
recognition, where the model needs to identify proper nouns in context, and machine
translation, where syntax and semantics from both directions are critical for accurate
translations. For instance, BiLSTMs have been shown to improve the performance of
systems like Google Translate, which need to understand entire phrases rather than
isolated words.
Benefits: By leveraging information from both past and future states, BiLSTMs im-
prove the model’s ability to make accurate predictions. This dual-context learning
often results in better performance on tasks that require a comprehensive understand-
ing of input sequences, leading to more reliable outputs in applications like sentiment
analysis and text generation.

•

Paper [64] presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiDLSTM)-based intru-
sion detection system that significantly enhances detection accuracy while reducing false
alarm rates for various network attacks, particularly User-to-Root (U2R) and Remote-to-
Local (R2L) threats, when compared to conventional models. This model effectively learns
long-term visual–language interactions, achieving competitive performance in caption
generation and superior results in image–sentence retrieval through innovative hierar-
chical embeddings and data augmentation techniques. Moreover, article [65] develops
and evaluates both unidirectional and Bidirectional LSTM models for short-term traffic
prediction. The findings reveal that the Bidirectional LSTM outperforms its unidirectional
counterpart, achieving over 90% accuracy in speed predictions for up to 60 min, as well
as high accuracy in traffic flow predictions across various horizons, thereby providing
reliable AI tools for road operators. In addition, the study by Huang et al. [66] introduces a
novel prognostic method that utilizes Bidirectional LSTM networks to effectively integrate
sensor and operational condition data for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of
engineered systems. This approach demonstrates superior performance in a case study that
focused on aircraft turbofan engines compared to existing AI-based methods. Finally, the
article by Mahadevaswamy et al. [67] summarizes the application of a Bidirectional LSTM
network for sentiment analysis, successfully classifying Amazon product reviews into
positive and negative categories. This achievement is attributed to the network’s capability
to manage long-term dependencies, based on a comprehensive dataset of 104,975 reviews
of mobile electronics.

4.2. Stacked LSTMs

Stacked LSTMs refer to the architecture where multiple LSTM layers are stacked on
top of each other [68–71]. This deep architecture allows the model to learn more complex
representations of the data:

• Architecture: In a Stacked LSTM, the output of one LSTM layer serves as the input
to the next layer. This hierarchical structure enables the model to capture high-level

AI 2025, 6, 215

11 of 21

•

features at deeper layers while retaining the temporal dynamics in the lower layers.
Typically, the first few layers might focus on capturing simple patterns, while deeper
layers can learn more complex relationships in the data.
Example: In speech recognition, lower layers of a Stacked LSTM might focus on
phonetic features, such as phonemes and intonation, while higher layers can capture
linguistic structures and context. For instance, a model might first learn to recognize
the sounds of words and then understand them in the context of sentences, leading to
more accurate transcriptions.

• Applications: Stacked LSTMs are effective in tasks requiring intricate feature extrac-
tion, such as video analysis, natural language processing, and handwriting recognition.
For example, in video analysis, lower layers might extract motion patterns, while
higher layers could recognize actions like running or jumping. This capability allows
for sophisticated applications, such as action recognition in sports or surveillance
footage analysis.
Benefits: The increased capacity of Stacked LSTMs allows them to model more com-
plex relationships within the data, leading to improved performance on challenging
tasks. However, this complexity requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid
overfitting, particularly when working with smaller datasets.

•

The study by Ma et al. [68] develops a Stacked LSTM neural network model designed
to predict daily quality control records for radiotherapy machines with remarkable accuracy.
This model not only outperforms the ARIMA model but also demonstrates robustness
in forecasting potential machine failures, thereby facilitating preventive maintenance. In
a comprehensive review, Ghimire et al. [69] present modeling techniques and introduce
a hybrid SAELSTM framework that combines deep learning with Manta Ray Foraging
Optimization. This innovative framework constructs accurate prediction intervals for
daily Global Solar Radiation, showcasing superior performance compared to conventional
machine learning models and significantly enhancing solar energy monitoring systems.
Wang et al. [70] introduce a stacked residual LSTM model aimed at predicting sentiment
intensity. By incorporating residual connections, this model effectively addresses the chal-
lenges associated with training deeper networks, resulting in improved optimization and
prediction accuracy compared to traditional lexicon-based, regression, and neural network
methods. Finally, Yu et al. [71] introduce a novel hierarchical fault diagnosis algorithm
based on Stacked LSTM networks for rolling bearings, achieving an impressive accuracy
of over 99%. This algorithm automatically extracts features from raw temporal signals
without preprocessing, surpassing traditional methods and state-of-the-art intelligent fault
diagnosis techniques.

4.3. Attention Mechanisms

Attention Mechanisms have revolutionized the way sequence-to-sequence models op-
erate, particularly in conjunction with LSTMs [72–77]. These mechanisms allow the model
to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output
sequence. These variants and improvements—Bidirectional LSTMs, Stacked LSTMs, and
Attention Mechanisms—enhance the capabilities of traditional LSTM networks, making
them more effective for a wider range of applications. By leveraging these advancements,
researchers and practitioners can achieve better performance and more accurate results in
complex sequence modeling tasks:

•

Concept: Instead of treating all input tokens equally, Attention Mechanisms weigh the
importance of different tokens for each output token. This selective focus enables the
model to capture relevant context more effectively, which is particularly beneficial in
long sequences where not all parts of the input are equally important for every output.

Example: In machine translation, when translating a long sentence, the model can
focus on the relevant words that contribute to the meaning of the current output
word. For instance, in translating “The cat sat on the mat,” the model might focus on
“cat” when generating the word “it,” improving the coherence of the translation. This
capability helps in generating more fluent and accurate translations, particularly in
complex sentences.
Applications: Attention Mechanisms are widely used in tasks such as machine transla-
tion, text summarization, image captioning, and even video analysis. For example,
in text summarization, attention helps the model identify key sentences in a docu-
ment to create concise summaries that encapsulate the main ideas without losing
important context.
Benefits: The integration of attention with LSTMs leads to significant improvements
in performance, particularly for long sequences. It reduces the burden on the LSTM
to remember all previous states, allowing it to concentrate on relevant information
dynamically. This has led to the development of models like the Transformer, which
relies heavily on Attention Mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art results in various
NLP tasks.

The study by Sang et al. [72] introduces the Attention Mechanism Variant LSTM
(AMV-LSTM), which significantly improves stock price prediction accuracy. This model
enhances traditional LSTM frameworks by coupling the forget and input gates, adding a
simple forget gate to the long-term state, and incorporating an Attention Mechanism. As
a result, it effectively addresses stability and overfitting challenges commonly associated
with conventional LSTM models. In a related effort, Lin et al. [73] present a dual-stage
attention-based LSTM network tailored for short-term zonal electricity load probabilis-
tic forecasting. This innovative approach enhances feature selection through a feature
attention encoder and captures temporal dependencies via a decoder, yielding improved
accuracy and generalization over existing models, particularly on the GEFCom2014 dataset.
Moreover, Xiang et al. [74] propose a novel fault detection method for wind turbines
that integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an attention-enhanced Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). By utilizing SCADA data, this method effectively
extracts dynamic changes, improves learning accuracy, and provides early warnings for
anomalies, thereby enabling the prediction of early failures in wind turbine components.
In the realm of environmental monitoring, Yang et al. [75] introduce a water quality pre-
diction model known as CNN-LSTM with Attention (CLA). This model forecasts pH and
NH3-N levels in the Beilun Estuary by employing linear interpolation for missing data
and wavelet techniques for denoising. The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture effectively
addresses nonlinear time series prediction, with the Attention Mechanism enhancing long-
term dependencies. Experimental findings demonstrate that CLA outperforms existing
models and maintains stable predictions across various time lags. Furthermore, Ran et
al. [76] propose an LSTM method augmented with an Attention Mechanism for travel time
prediction. This model addresses the limitations of traditional LSTMs by incorporating
departure time and modeling long-term dependencies through a tree structure. Utilizing
datasets from Highways England, the experimental results indicate that the proposed
model achieves superior accuracy compared to standard LSTM and other baseline meth-
ods, effectively leveraging the Attention Mechanism to enhance predictions. Finally, Liu
et al. [77] introduce the attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with a
convolution layer (AC-BiLSTM) architecture. By combining a convolutional layer with
BiLSTM and an Attention Mechanism, this model enhances text classification tasks in
natural language processing. It excels at extracting higher-level phrase representations and
capturing both local and global semantic features, demonstrating superior classification

thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

5. Challenges and Limitations

Despite the effectiveness of LSTM networks in various applications, they are not
without their challenges and limitations. This section discusses three major issues: Compu-
tational Complexity, Data Requirements, and Training Difficulties.

5.1. Computational Complexity

LSTM networks are inherently complex due to their architecture, which includes

multiple gates and memory cells. This complexity leads to several challenges:

•

• High Resource Consumption: LSTMs require significant computational resources,
especially for large datasets and deep architectures. Training an LSTM model can
demand substantial CPU or GPU time, making it less feasible for real-time applications.
For instance, training a state-of-the-art LSTM for natural language processing tasks
may require specialized hardware, like TPUs, which can be costly.
Scalability Issues: As the size of the network increases, particularly when stacking
multiple LSTM layers, scalability becomes a concern. The time taken to train and
the memory required can grow exponentially, limiting the model’s applicability in
resource-constrained environments. This limitation can hinder the deployment of
LSTM-based models in mobile or embedded systems where computational power
is limited.
Inference Speed: The complexity of LSTMs can also affect inference speed, which is
critical in applications like real-time speech recognition or chatbots. Slower inference
can hinder user experience and system performance, leading to delays that may
frustrate users. For example, in a customer support chatbot, any lag in response time
can diminish the perceived quality of the service.

•

5.2. Data Requirements

LSTMs require substantial amounts of high-quality data for effective training. This

necessity poses several challenges:

•

Large Datasets: LSTMs typically perform well when trained on large datasets, which
may not always be available. In domains with limited data, such as specialized medical
applications or niche markets, LSTMs can overfit, leading to poor generalization on

AI 2025, 6, 215

14 of 21

unseen data. This issue can result in models that perform well on training data but
fail to deliver accurate predictions in real-world scenarios.

• Data Quality: The quality of the training data significantly impacts model perfor-
mance. Noisy, unstructured, or biased data can result in suboptimal learning outcomes.
For example, in natural language processing, poorly annotated datasets can lead to
models that misunderstand context or semantics, thereby generating irrelevant or
incorrect outputs.

• Domain-Specific Data: Training LSTMs for specialized tasks often requires domain-
specific data, which can be difficult and time-consuming to collect. In fields like
healthcare, obtaining annotated datasets can involve extensive collaboration with ex-
perts and adherence to regulatory standards, complicating the data collection process
and extending project timelines.

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that synthetic data can effectively compensate
for limited real-world datasets in LSTM applications [78,79]. For example, GAN-generated
time series [80–82] have been used to augment LSTM training in condition monitoring
and predictive maintenance, and synthetic speech features have been employed to pre-
train LSTM-based speaker recognition models. Similar approaches have also been applied
in climate modeling by combining ConvLSTM [83,84] with synthetic sequence data to
improve prediction accuracy in data-sparse regions. These examples demonstrate that
LSTMs can still be applied in data-scarce scenarios when appropriate data augmentation
techniques are used.

5.3. Training Difficulties

Training LSTM networks presents several challenges that can affect their effectiveness:

•

Long Training Times: Due to their complexity, LSTMs can take a long time to train,
especially with large datasets. This extended training period can be a barrier to rapid
prototyping and experimentation. Researchers may find it difficult to iterate quickly
on model designs, slowing down the overall development process and delaying the
deployment of solutions.

• Hyperparameter Tuning: LSTMs have numerous hyperparameters (e.g., learning
rate, number of layers, hidden units) that need to be carefully tuned for optimal
performance. Finding the right combination can be challenging and often requires
extensive experimentation. This tuning process can be resource-intensive, requiring
multiple training runs and potentially consuming significant computational resources.
Vanishing and Exploding Gradients: Although LSTMs are designed to mitigate the
vanishing gradient problem, they are still susceptible to exploding gradients during
training. This issue can lead to unstable learning and hinder the convergence of the
model. If not properly managed, exploding gradients can cause the model to diverge,
resulting in NaN values during training and necessitating the need for gradient
clipping or other stabilizing techniques.

•

Table 4 summarizes the various challenges and limitations associated with LSTM
networks, highlighting their implications on performance and applicability. While LSTM
networks offer significant advantages in sequence modeling, they also face substantial chal-
lenges that can limit their effectiveness and applicability. Understanding these limitations
is crucial for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement LSTMs successfully in
various domains.

6. Recent Advances and Trends

As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, recent advances and trends in
LSTM networks reflect ongoing innovations in architectures, performance evaluations, and
emerging research areas. This section explores these developments in detail.

6.1. Innovations in LSTM Architectures

Innovations in LSTM architectures have significantly enhanced their capabilities and
performance in various applications. Researchers have introduced several modifications to
the traditional LSTM design, aiming to address specific limitations and improve training
efficiency. One notable innovation is the development of peephole connections, which allow
LSTMs to access the cell state directly from the gates. This modification enables the model to
make more informed decisions based on the current memory content, leading to improved
learning dynamics. Another advancement is the Grid LSTM, which extends the LSTM
architecture to handle multi-dimensional sequences. This architecture is particularly useful
in applications like video processing, where spatial and temporal information must be
captured simultaneously. By organizing the LSTM cells in a grid structure, the Grid LSTM
can effectively learn complex relationships in high-dimensional data. Additionally, layer
normalization techniques have been integrated into LSTM architectures to stabilize training
and improve convergence speed. This approach normalizes the inputs across features
rather than across the batch, making it particularly beneficial for recurrent networks where
batch sizes can vary.

6.2. Performance Comparisons

As various LSTM architectures and variants have emerged, numerous studies have
conducted performance comparisons to evaluate their effectiveness against traditional mod-
els and other sequence-based architectures [85–87]. Recent benchmarks indicate that LSTMs
often outperform standard RNNs in tasks involving long-range dependencies [88–90]. How-
ever, newer architectures, such as the Transformer, have shown superior performance in
many natural language processing tasks, prompting researchers to explore hybrid models
that combine the strengths of LSTMs and Attention Mechanisms [91–93]. For instance,
studies comparing LSTMs to Transformers in machine translation tasks have revealed
that while LSTMs can handle sequence data effectively, Transformers often achieve better
performance in terms of accuracy and training efficiency, mainly because Transformers
process entire sequences simultaneously rather than sequentially [94–96]. Nevertheless,
LSTMs remain valuable in several scenarios: in data-scarce or resource-limited settings,
they often demonstrate better convergence and generalization properties due to their se-
quential inductive biasing, and in real-time or embedded applications (e.g., healthcare

AI 2025, 6, 215

16 of 21

monitoring and industrial IoT), LSTM-based models have been shown to offer competitive
performance and lower computational overhead on wearable sensor tasks [97–99]. More-
over, comparisons have highlighted that integrating Attention Mechanisms with LSTMs
can enhance their performance significantly, particularly in tasks requiring contextual
understanding over long sequences [100,101]. These hybrid models leverage the temporal
strengths of LSTMs while benefiting from the contextual awareness provided by Attention
Mechanisms [102,103].

6.3. Emerging Research Areas

Emerging research areas related to LSTMs reflect the ongoing exploration of their capa-
bilities in various fields. One significant area is transfer learning, where pre-trained LSTM
models are adapted to new tasks with limited data [104]. This approach has gained traction
as it allows models to leverage prior knowledge, reducing the need for extensive training
on datasets. Another promising area is the application of LSTMs in reinforcement learning.
Researchers are investigating how LSTMs can be used to model environments with tem-
poral dependencies, enabling agents to make better decisions based on past experiences.
This integration has the potential to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning
algorithms in complex and dynamic environments. Recent studies demonstrate this po-
tential: for instance, LSTM networks have been incorporated into a TD3 reinforcement
learning framework to improve robotic path planning in dynamic environments [105],
while GT-LSTM integrates geospatial and temporal dependencies to enhance agent-based
modeling in multimodal contexts [106]. Additionally, the adaptation of LSTMs for multi-
modal learning is gaining attention [107]. This involves combining LSTM networks with
other data types, such as images and audio, to create models that can process and un-
derstand information across different modalities. Applications in this area include video
analysis, where LSTMs can help analyze both visual and auditory components to interpret
scenes more effectively. Finally, advancements in explainable AI (XAI) are prompting
researchers to focus on making LSTM models more interpretable [108]. Understanding
how LSTMs make decisions is crucial for their deployment in sensitive applications like
healthcare and finance, where transparency is essential.

7. Conclusions

In conclusion, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have established them-
selves as a cornerstone in the field of sequence modeling, offering powerful solutions for
tasks involving temporal dependencies. While the most significant challenges currently
limiting their broader adoption remain (i) the high computational cost and long training
times, (ii) the tendency to overfit on limited data, and (iii) the lack of interpretability
compared to more recent architectures, LSTMs nevertheless remain highly competitive in
specific scenarios. These include applications where strict temporal ordering is essential
(e.g., real-time sensor streams and speech processing), situations where training data is
scarce, and deployments that require lightweight models for edge devices.

Recent innovations in LSTM architectures, such as peephole connections and Grid
LSTMs, have enhanced their capabilities and broadened their applicability to more complex
data. In parallel, performance comparisons with Transformer-based models highlight the
evolving landscape of deep learning, where hybrid approaches that combine the strengths
of LSTMs and Attention Mechanisms are gaining traction.

In terms of future research, emerging areas such as transfer learning, reinforcement
learning, and multimodal learning indicate promising directions and demonstrate the
adaptability of LSTM networks across various domains—from natural language processing
to video analysis. Continued efforts to reduce computational overhead, improve general-

AI 2025, 6, 215

ization in low-data environments, and increase model interpretability will be central for
advancing LSTM technology and maximizing its practical impact.

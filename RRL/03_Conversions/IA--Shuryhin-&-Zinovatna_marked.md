ABSTRACT
The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in consumer markets presents challenges, particularly in how cognitive biases
influence financial decision-making. These biases can lead to irrational spending, raising ethical concerns about AI’s role in such
applications. This research explores how AI can enhance decision-making effectiveness and support consumers in making more
rational financial choices. The focus is on developing an intelligent financial management system that applies modern AI algorithms
to analyze financial behavior, detect anomalies, and offer personalized recommendations. The article considers a system for
generating personalized financial recommendations based on large language models, which uses transaction history, predicted costs,
and anomaly information to generate individual advice. Techniques include using Isolation Forest for identifying atypical financial
actions and a combination of ARIMA and LSTM models for budget forecasting. The research also considers integrating these models
with large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized recommendations. The methodological part of the work includes an
analysis of existing models and their areas of application, defining data types and structures for processing, developing a system that
integrates the available models, and testing it. The process of generating recommendations is described, which includes the stages of
processing input data, forming context, generating recommendations and evaluating them taking into account user characteristics,
such as risk level, financial goals and preferences. The generated recommendations are aimed at optimizing the user's financial
behavior and can be adapted to different income levels. Special attention is paid to the ethical aspects of the system, which include
ensuring confidentiality, fairness and transparency, as well as the importance of supporting user autonomy in making financial
decisions. The system promotes responsible financial behavior by helping to avoid impulsive spending and increasing financial
awareness without manipulation or imposing specific decisions.

АНОТАЦІЯ
Стрімке поширення штучного інтелекту (ШІ) на споживчих ринках створює серйозні виклики для суспільства, зокрема
в контексті використання когнітивних упереджень, що впливають на ухвалення фінансових рішень споживачами. Ці
упередження можуть призводити до нераціональних витрат, що ставить під сумнів етичність застосування ШІ у подібних
сферах. У цьому дослідженні розглядається, як ШІ може не тільки підвищувати ефективність ухвалення фінансових рішень,
але й допомагати споживачам приймати більш обґрунтовані та раціональні рішення. Основна увага зосереджена на розробці
інтелектуальної системи управління фінансами, яка застосовує сучасні алгоритми ШІ для аналізу фінансової поведінки,
виявлення аномалій та надання персоналізованих рекомендацій. У статті розглядається система генерації персоналізованих
фінансових рекомендацій на основі великих мовних моделей, яка використовує історію транзакцій, прогнозовані витрати та
інформацію про аномалії для створення індивідуальних порад. Зокрема, досліджуються моделі машинного навчання, такі як
Isolation Forest для ідентифікації атипових фінансових дій, а також поєднання ARIMA та LSTM для прогнозування
бюджетів. Дослідження також розглядає можливість інтеграції цих моделей із використанням великих мовних моделей
(LLM) для генерування персоналізованих рекомендацій. Методологічна частина роботи включає аналіз існуючих моделей і
сфер їхнього застосування, визначення типів та структури даних для обробки, розробку системи, що інтегрує наявні моделі,
та її тестування. Описано процес формування рекомендацій, що включає етапи обробки вхідних даних, формування
контексту, генерації рекомендацій та їх оцінки з урахуванням характеристик користувача, таких як рівень ризику, фінансові
цілі та уподобання. Генеровані рекомендації спрямовані на оптимізацію фінансової поведінки користувача та можуть бути
адаптовані до різних рівнів доходів. Окрему увагу приділено етичним аспектам системи, що включають забезпечення
конфіденційності, справедливості та прозорості, а також важливості підтримки автономії користувача у прийнятті
фінансових рішень. Система сприяє розвитку відповідальної фінансової поведінки, допомагаючи уникати імпульсивних
витрат та підвищуючи фінансову обізнаність без маніпуляцій чи нав’язування конкретних рішень.
Ключові слова: штучний інтелект, машинне навчання, когнітивні упередження, фінансові рішення, етичність.

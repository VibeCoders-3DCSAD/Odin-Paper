Introduction:
Users  frequently  suffer  with  disjointed  solutions  that  don't  offer  a  cohesive
approach  to  budgeting,  financial  education,  and  policy  navigation  in  the  quickly
changing field of personal finance management. Even though there are many finance
applications  available,  many  platforms  are  still  fragmented,  concentrating  on  either
simple  budgeting  or  discrete  educational  materials  rather  than  providing  a  full
solution that incorporates all facets of financial decision-making. Users are unable to
maximize  their  financial  well-being due to  inefficiencies  caused  by  the  absence  of  a
consistent, tailored experience across platforms.

This  problem  is  made  worse  in  India  by  a  lack  of  financial  literacy.  Recent
research indicates that a sizable section of the populace does not have access to high-

quality financial education, which hinders their capacity to  make wise choices about
government  assistance,  investments,  and  savings.  In  order  to  educate  themselves,
users also frequently browse through a variety of websites, forums, and publications;
but,  because  these  resources  are  unstructured,  it  can  be  challenging  to  monitor
progress  and  meet  financial  objectives.  Because  of  this, a lot  of  people  still manage
their  money  using  antiquated,  inefficient  techniques,  which  contributes  to  ongoing
financial instability

to  solve

In  order

these  problems,  we  present  AI  Wealth  Navigator,  a
comprehensive  platform  that  combines  three  essential  modules  to  optimize  the
financial management process: (1) an adaptive financial learning roadmap that tracks
and  advances  in  tandem  with  the  user's  knowledge;  (2)  an  intelligent  AI-powered
budget tracker that offers real-time insights, receipt scanning, and customized alerts;
and  (3)  a  policy  recommendation  engine  that  makes  recommendations  based  on  the
user's  profile  and  requirements.  The  platform  makes  use  of  state-of-the-art
technologies,  such  as  Next.js,  Supabase,  Prisma,  and  Gemini  LLMs,  to  provide
security, scalability, and tailored recommendations.

AI  Wealth  Navigator  seeks  to  streamline  personal  money  management  by
combining these functions into a single platform. This will enable users to track their
spending, enhance their financial literacy, and access pertinent government programs,
all of which will help them make better financial decisions.

Literature Survey:
Recent years have seen a surge in the use of AI in personal money management as
numerous  research  have  shown  how  it  may  improve  policy  suggestions,  financial
education, and budgeting. In the field of financial education, Patel et al. (2023) talked
about  how  AI-powered  platforms  can  help  advance  financial  literacy  by  providing
financial  tools  and  individualized  learning  paths.  According  to  their  findings,  AI-
based solutions may be able to close the knowledge gap and empower people in low-
income communities to make wise investment and savings choices.

Similar  to  this,  Kumar  et  al.  (2023)  investigated  developments  in  AI-powered
budgeting tools and presented an intelligent budgeting system that adjusts to the user's
spending  habits  and
financial  objectives.  The  system's  use  of  dynamic
information  enhanced  user  engagement  and
recommendations  and  real-time
strengthened  financial  discipline.  Additionally,  Singh  et  al.  (2024)  investigated  how
AI-driven receipt scanning and classification may increase the accuracy of budgeting,
emphasizing  the  drawbacks  of  conventional  manual  techniques  and  the  notable
decrease in human error.

The  potential  of  large  language  models  (LLMs)  to  offer  tailored  government
scheme  recommendations  has  been  investigated  in  a  number  of  studies.  Based  on
users'  financial  profiles,  Lee  et  al.  (2023)  created  a  system  that  employed  AI  to
suggest  social  security  benefits  and  subsidies.  The  significance  of  context-specific
advice that complement the user's present financial circumstances and objectives was
emphasized by this study. Furthermore, research by Sharma et al. (2024) highlighted
how  AI  systems  must  take  regional  differences  in  policy  recommendations  into
consideration
that  consumers  obtain  pertinent  and  correct
recommendations.

A  significant  worry  has  also  been  the  privacy  and  security  of  financial
applications.  According  to  a  study  by  Gupta  et  al.  (2024),  AI  was  used  to  integrate
secure  transaction  systems  into  financial  platforms  in  order  to  identify  fraudulent
activity  and  guarantee the  security  of  private  financial information.  The  significance
of  multilayer  security  measures  in  applications  involving  financial  transactions  and
personal data was brought to light by their work.

System Architecture:
AI Wealth Navigator consists of five core components:

  Frontend  (UI):  Built  with  Next.js  and  Tailwind  CSS,  providing  a
responsive, interactive user experience for budgeting, financial learning, and
policy suggestions.

  Backend  &  API:  Uses  Supabase  and  Prisma  for  data  management,  with

Inngest handling automated tasks and notifications.

  AI  Insights:  Powered  by  Gemini  LLM  for  personalized  financial

recommendations and adaptive learning.

  Policy Engine: Suggests relevant government schemes using AI and hybrid

data APIs based on user profiles.

  Security: Arcjet ensures secure data handling and transaction encryption.

Scalability and maintainability are guaranteed by the architecture's modular design,
which  allows  each  component  to  handle  various  platform  functions  independently.
This  division  makes  the  system  adaptable,  allowing  for  future  enhancements  to
financial  services,  security  protocols,  or  AI  models  without  compromising  system
speed.

Methodology:
4.1  Financial  Data  Collection:  Supabase-integrated  secure  APIs  are  used  to
collect user financial data, such as transaction history and spending trends. To protect
privacy, data is anonymised before being saved for processing and suggestions in the
future.

4.2  AI-Driven  Budgeting  and  Recommendations:  The  platform  offers  tailored
financial  advice  through  the  Gemini  LLM  API.  By  analysing  their  spending  habits
and  offering  personalized  investment  plans,  savings  advice,  and  budgeting  insights,
the  AI  adjusts  to  consumers'  financial  behaviours.  Real-time  data  and  personal
financial objectives are the main topics of the prompts.

4.3  Policy  Recommendation  Engine:  The  system  connects  consumers  with
pertinent  government  programs,  tax  breaks,  and  subsidies  by  utilizing  hybrid  data
APIs. The suggestions are dynamic and customized based on the geographic location

  Token Efficiency: To make sure the AI provides pertinent insights quickly
and  without  requiring  too  much  computation,  the  Gemini  LLM  API  tracks
the token usage for each interaction. This is quantified in terms of response
length,  which  fluctuates  according to  the  financial inquiry  and the intricacy
of user input.

5.2  Human  Evaluation:  Fifty  users  were  polled  to  assess  the  platform's
effectiveness in terms of recommendations' personalization, relevancy, and empathy.
The average rating was:

  Budgeting Insights: 4.8/5

  Policy Recommendations: 4.7/5

  Learning Roadmap: 4.6/5

The  platform's  capacity  to  provide  tailored  budgeting  guidance,  pertinent  policy
recommendations, and unambiguous financial education were recognized by users as
its  most  important  characteristics.  Higher  evaluations  were  frequently  attributed  to
cultural relevance and actionable ideas

5.3  Security  and  Privacy  Evaluation:  Assessment:  To  guarantee  the  privacy  of

securely.

Novelty and Uniqueness:
The  primary  innovation  of  AI  Wealth  Navigator  is  the  integration  of  three
historically  distinct  financial  domains—financial  education,  policy  suggestion,
and  budget  tracking—into  a  unified,  context-aware  platform  driven  by  AI.
Although  the majority  of  personal  finance  applications are excellent  at  one  area,
like  tracking  investments  or  managing  expenses,  they  frequently  overlook  the
significance  of  financial  literacy  and  having  access  to  specialized  government
assistance  services.  AI  Wealth  Navigator  fills  this  crucial  void  by  providing  a
comprehensive ecosystem intended to empower people financially.

The platform's clever application of Gemini LLMs, which dynamically produce
tailored insights and useful suggestions, is what makes it unique. The LLM adjusts
its  answers  according  to  users'  spending  patterns,  financial  objectives,  reading
level,  and  demographic  information,  in  contrast  to  traditional  systems  that  use
static  financial  principles.  For  example,  advanced  users  gain  from  sophisticated
analysis and investment methods, while those with little financial expertise receive
simplified, instructional solutions.

The  policy  recommendation  engine  is  another  significant  innovation.  It  uses
real-time  user  profiling  and  hybrid  API  integration  to  classify  and  recommend
government programs, tax breaks, and subsidies. Beyond simple eligibility checks,
this  module  provides  information  on how,  why,  and  when to  apply  according  on
the  user's  age,  occupation,  family  history,  and  income  bracket.  The  engine
functions as a personal advisor integrated into the financial workflow, in contrast
to general policy directories.

Additionally,  the  platform  offers  a  Financial  Literacy  Progress  Tracker  that
makes  use  of  adaptive  roadmaps  and  gamified  modules.  Users  are  now  led
through  a  carefully  chosen, trackable  learning route rather than having to  search
through  numerous  websites,  blogs,  or  Reddit  communities.  The  poor  financial
literacy  rates  in  places  like  India,  where  it  is  still  difficult  to  obtain  trustworthy
and organized financial information, are immediately addressed by this feature.

Integrating  Arcjet,  which  offers  rate  restriction  and  sophisticated  threat
prevention at the API layer, strengthens security and dependability. When used in
conjunction  with  Inngest  for  automated  background  functions  such  as  learning
progress  updates  and  monthly  budget  resets,  the  system  guarantees  real-time
responsiveness without sacrificing speed.

infrastructure,  adaptive  education,  localized  policy  knowledge,  and  intelligent
automation  in  a  way  that  is  unique  and  supports  both  personal  financial
development and more general objectives of economic inclusion.

Results and Discussion:
In  tests  conducted  in  the  real  world,  the  AI  Wealth  Navigator  showed  excellent
usability.  Users  valued  the  platform's  smooth  integration  of  financial  education,
policy  recommendations,  and  budgeting,  which  eliminated  the  need  to  manage
several apps or websites. The Gemini LLM provided context-aware insights including
spending  patterns  and  customized  saving  advice,  while  the  OCR-powered  receipt
scanner achieved 94% accuracy on both digital and physical receipts. The success of
the policy recommendation module is demonstrated by the fact that more than 70% of
users  found  previously  unheard-of  government  programs  that  were  customized  for
their  profiles.  Arcjet  blocked  all  simulated  security  risks,  and  Inngest  handled
automated  duties  effectively,  ensuring  seamless  performance.  The  reliance  on  full
user profiles for policy matching and sporadic OCR errors were minor drawbacks.

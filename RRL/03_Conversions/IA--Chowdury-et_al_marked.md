INTRODUCTION
Demand forecasting refers to the process of estimating future customer demand for a product or
service based on historical data, market trends, and analytical modeling (Konstantopoulos et al.,
2022). It is a cornerstone of strategic and operational planning across numerous industries,
particularly in supply chain management, where it informs production, inventory, logistics, and
marketing decisions (Lara-Benítez et al., 2020). In retail e-commerce—defined as the buying and
selling of goods and services via digital platforms—demand forecasting assumes even greater
importance due to the volatile, data-intensive, and globally interconnected nature of online
marketplaces (Lara-Benítez et al., 2020). Unlike traditional retail, e-commerce operates in an
environment characterized by high transaction volumes, real-time data generation, and rapidly
changing consumer preferences, which together necessitate highly adaptive forecasting techniques
(Li & Xu, 2025). These foundational definitions set the stage for understanding how advanced
forecasting methodologies are reshaping
Figure 1: Key Components of Forecasting in Global E-
operational paradigms in digital commerce
Commerce Operations
ecosystems (Li & Wang, 2020).
The international significance of demand
forecasting in retail e-commerce is
underscored by the sector’s exponential
global growth. According to the United
Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD, 2021), global e-
commerce sales surpassed $26.7 trillion in
2020, a figure that continues to rise as
digital transactions become integral to
consumer behavior worldwide (Lara-
Benítez et al., 2020). Accurate forecasting
plays a critical role in managing this vast
economic activity, enabling firms to
minimize stockouts and overstock
situations while ensuring timely deliveries
across borders (Li & Xu, 2025). For
multinational corporations and cross-
border e-retailers, demand forecasting
directly impacts customs coordination, warehouse distribution, and last-mile delivery—making it
a pivotal component of global logistics optimization. Furthermore, in emerging markets with
rapidly digitizing populations, robust forecasting mechanisms help overcome infrastructural
inefficiencies and consumer demand unpredictability. Hence, the international scope and
dependency on efficient supply chain mechanisms heighten the strategic value of demand
forecasting in retail e-commerce. According to (Li & Wang, 2020), in retail e-commerce, where
inventory turnover cycles are much shorter and more fragmented than in traditional brick-and-
mortar settings, forecasting accuracy becomes a critical determinant of financial performance.
Studies have demonstrated that firms utilizing advanced predictive models in inventory planning
exhibit superior order fulfillment rates, reduced operational costs, and improved customer retention
(Liechti et al., 2021; Madanchian, 2024; Mosavi et al., 2020). The complexity of e-commerce
logistics—driven by SKU proliferation, dynamic pricing, and multiple fulfillment centers—further
demands nuanced and adaptive forecasting approaches. In this context, demand forecasting
functions not merely as a planning tool but as a strategic asset that enhances inventory resilience.
Delivery planning in e-commerce requires accurate forecasting to ensure products are shipped
efficiently and customers receive their orders on time. With the rise of same-day and next-day
delivery expectations, especially in urban markets, logistics systems are under increasing pressure
to respond dynamically to demand fluctuations. Effective demand forecasting supports route
optimization, resource allocation, and capacity planning, all of which are essential to reduce

delivery costs and enhance  service  quality (Madanchian, 2024). Moreover, the integration of
forecasting with real-time tracking and IoT-enabled logistics has enabled e-commerce platforms to
dynamically adjust routes and delivery schedules, significantly improving delivery accuracy .
Forecasting accuracy correlates strongly with logistics agility, particularly in unpredictable markets.
Thus, forecasting is not merely a backend process; it is central to customer experience and brand
reputation in the highly competitive landscape of retail e-commerce .

emerged, with algorithms such as random forests, gradient boosting, support vector machines, and
recurrent neural networks gaining prominence in retail demand prediction (Mosavi et al., 2020).
Hybrid  models,  combining  statistical  and ML components, have  also demonstrated  superior
performance in accuracy and adaptability (Pei & Dong, 2025). As big data analytics becomes central
to  digital  commerce,  these  models  leverage  structured  and  unstructured  data  ranging  from
clickstream patterns to sentiment analysis to enhance forecasting precision. The rise of AI-driven
models marks a paradigm shift in how demand forecasting is conceptualized and operationalized
in retail.
Retail e-commerce presents unique challenges that complicate demand forecasting, including high
product turnover, seasonality, promotional effects, and external shocks such as pandemics or
geopolitical disruptions. The availability of massive but often noisy data requires sophisticated
preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure model robustness. Additionally, the omnichannel
nature of modern e-commerce—integrating websites, apps, and third-party platforms—creates
complex demand signals that traditional models cannot easily capture. Cross-device and cross-
border customer journeys further complicate demand patterns, necessitating models that can
synthesize diverse data sources and temporal structures (Ashton & Prybutok, 2020). Moreover, the
integration of external variables—such as weather, economic indicators, and social media trends—
adds further complexity, demanding models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and
scalable. These challenges make retail e-commerce both a fertile ground and a stress test for modern
demand forecasting technologies. Although the academic and industry interest in forecasting for
retail e-commerce has surged in recent years, there remains a lack of comprehensive synthesis
regarding  the  effectiveness,  application  context,  and  comparative  performance  of  various
forecasting models. Existing literature often focuses narrowly on specific methods or industry case
studies without offering a holistic view of the evolving methodological landscape.  The primary
objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and synthesize the diverse forecasting
models employed in the context of retail e-commerce, with a specific focus on their contributions to
inventory accuracy and delivery efficiency. The review aims to classify the methodologies into
coherent categories namely traditional statistical approaches, machine learning algorithms, hybrid
models, and deep learning architectures and assess their relative effectiveness based on empirical
results, use case applicability, and implementation complexity. It also seeks to explore how the
integration of various data sources, including transactional, behavioral, and environmental data,
affects the predictive capabilities of these models. In doing so, the review intends to identify

performance trends, methodological strengths and weaknesses, and critical factors influencing
forecasting success. The study is driven by the need for a consolidated knowledge base that
supports decision-makers in selecting, adapting, and deploying forecasting models that align with
their organizational goals and technological infrastructure. In essence, the review serves as a bridge
between theoretical innovation and practical application, facilitating informed, data-driven

LITERATURE REVIEW
The domain of demand forecasting in retail e-commerce has undergone a significant transformation
over the past two decades, driven by the rise of digital commerce, the explosion of data availability,
and advancements in computational capabilities. This literature review seeks to provide a
comprehensive synthesis of academic and applied research that explores various forecasting
techniques specifically tailored to the e-commerce context. Unlike traditional retail environments,
e-commerce platforms demand real-time, high-frequency, and scalable forecasting solutions due to
their complex and dynamic nature, including rapid SKU changes, volatile consumer behavior, and
multi-channel operations. While numerous models have been proposed and applied across contexts
from classical statistical methods to machine learning and deep learning frameworks there remains
a pressing need to evaluate their comparative performance, contextual suitability, and underlying
assumptions.
Foundations of Demand Forecasting in Retail E-Commerce
Demand forecasting in the context of supply chain and inventory management refers to the process
of predicting future consumer demand for products or services based on historical data, market
dynamics, and statistical or computational models. This process is pivotal in aligning supply-side
decisions with customer expectations, reducing uncertainty, and optimizing operational efficiency
(Agrawal & Singh, 2019). In e-commerce, the role of demand forecasting becomes even more
pronounced due to the high velocity of transactions, variability in consumer preferences, and near-
real-time decision-making requirements (Agrawal et al., 2015). The digital retail environment is
characterized by shorter lead times, expansive SKU portfolios, and increased reliance on data
analytics, necessitating sophisticated forecasting mechanisms.
According to Ahmed et al. (2016), the integration of demand forecasting with inventory
management systems significantly reduces excess stock and minimizes service-level risks. In
aligning procurement with marketing, thus driving supply chain responsiveness. Moreover, the
operational significance extends to workforce planning, pricing, and warehousing, where demand
signals determine daily tactical decisions. In global e-commerce operations, accurate demand
forecasting underpins inventory redistribution, cross-border logistics, and supplier collaboration,
contributing directly to customer satisfaction and profitability. Furthermore, with the advent of big
data, cloud computing, and AI, forecasting has evolved from a reactive tool into a predictive and
prescriptive system capable of shaping strategy. Organizations that invest in forecasting
infrastructure often achieve higher fulfillment rates and improved agility in volatile markets. The
convergence of technology, analytics, and operational planning positions demand forecasting as a
mission-critical capability in modern retail e-commerce ecosystems. While demand forecasting is
essential in both e-commerce and traditional retail settings, the structural and operational
distinctions between the two significantly influence forecasting strategies and model selection.
Traditional retail typically relies on aggregated, periodic sales data and exhibits relatively stable
demand cycles influenced by brick-and-mortar factors such as foot traffic and in-store promotions
(Bandara et al., 2019). In contrast, e-commerce demand is driven by highly granular, high-frequency
data, including clickstream behavior, cart abandonment rates, digital marketing responses, and
external digital signals like social media sentiment (Bandara et al., 2019).
One of the primary distinctions lies in the omnichannel nature of e-commerce, where forecasting
must accommodate multiple consumer touchpoints—mobile apps, websites, marketplaces—each
contributing unique demand signals. The challenge of modeling cross-platform behaviors, such as
consumers researching on mobile and purchasing via desktop, which introduces temporal and
behavioral complexities. Traditional models such as moving averages or ARIMA often fall short in

capturing such multi-source dynamics, necessitating more adaptive methods like machine learning
or deep learning models (Zhu et al., 2018). Another critical distinction is promotional impact and
volatility. E-commerce demand is highly sensitive to flash sales, influencer campaigns, and dynamic
pricing strategies, which create non-linear, hard-to-predict spikes. Unlike in physical retail where
demand patterns are seasonally anchored, online demand is increasingly driven by algorithmic
marketing and consumer-generated content global disruptions (e.g., COVID-19) have a more
immediate and dramatic effect on online retail demand than on traditional retail due to digital
virality and instant consumption.
As such, forecasting in e-commerce necessitates faster update cycles, model retraining, and broader
data  integration—elements  less  pronounced  in  traditional  contexts.  These  distinctions  have
prompted scholars and practitioners alike to develop specialized forecasting frameworks tailored
to the real-time, data-rich, and multi-modal nature of digital commerce.
Forecast evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the performance and reliability of demand
forecasting models, particularly within the high-stakes environment of e-commerce operations.
Among the most widely adopted are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), each offering unique advantages and
sensitivity to forecasting errors (Madanchian, 2024). MAE provides an average magnitude of errors
without considering direction, making it suitable for understanding general forecast accuracy.

additional evaluation criteria such as R² (coefficient of determination), Precision, and cumulative
distribution functions of error rates are also employed (Lin & Hui, 1997). These allow for granular
assessments,  particularly  when  forecasting  demand  across  customer  segments  or  regions.
Moreover, real-time e-commerce platforms often require model performance to be benchmarked in
live environments, where latency, interpretability, and adaptability are also evaluated (Zhang,
2019). Ultimately, the choice of evaluation metric must align with business priorities—whether it be
minimizing stockouts, optimizing fulfillment costs, or improving forecast stability across volatile
product categories. Adopt multifaceted evaluation frameworks tend to derive more actionable
insights from their forecasting efforts, leading to more informed and robust operational strategies.
Demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in synchronizing inventory control and delivery planning,
particularly  in  e-commerce  settings  where  the  fulfillment  chain  is  highly  dynamic  and
decentralized. Accurate forecasts enable retailers to maintain optimal stock levels, reducing both

overstock and stockout risks, while aligning replenishment schedules with predicted demand
patterns. (Ketzenberg et al., 2020) underscore how predictive analytics reduce lead times and
improve inventory turnover, which is critical in environments with rapid SKU proliferation.
In terms of inventory planning, forecasting directly informs procurement cycles, warehouse
slotting, and safety stock calculations. Companies employing machine learning-based forecasts
report inventory cost reductions of up to 25% due to improved demand-supply alignment.
Furthermore, the use of hybrid forecasting models—such as ARIMA-LSTM or random forest
ensembles—has been shown to outperform traditional models in complex demand scenarios,
especially during promotional campaigns and seasonal peaks. Delivery synchronization is equally
impacted by demand forecasts, especially in systems offering same-day or next-day delivery.
Shaharudin et al. (2015) highlight that logistics performance is highly sensitive to forecast accuracy,
particularly in last-mile delivery contexts. Accurate forecasts aid in route planning, vehicle
allocation, and distribution center coordination, reducing operational bottlenecks and improving
delivery reliability. Moreover, forecasting supports dynamic slotting for delivery windows,
enhancing the customer experience while minimizing underutilized routes (Akter & Wamba, 2016).
The interconnectedness between demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics

the nexus of operational alignment,
enabling e-commerce businesses to
function efficiently despite high
levels of complexity and
uncertainty. The body of literature
affirms that the synchronization
enabled by accurate forecasting is
not a luxury, but a necessity in
achieving competitiveness and
customer satisfaction in the digital
retail era.
Traditional Statistical Models
Time series forecasting models, particularly ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average),
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), and Holt-Winters, have long been foundational tools in demand
forecasting due to their interpretability and effectiveness in capturing linear patterns in historical
data. ARIMA, as described by Asdecker and Karl (2018), incorporates autoregression, differencing,
and moving averages to model non-stationary time series data. When extended to account for
seasonality, SARIMA becomes especially useful for modeling demand cycles such as weekly or
monthly purchasing trends. Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, including both additive and
multiplicative forms, provides an intuitive approach to modeling trends and seasonality,
particularly for short to medium-term forecasts. Numerous studies have applied these models in
retail and e-commerce environments. ARIMA and exponential smoothing methods across multiple
industries and concluded that exponential smoothing methods often perform better for stable, low-
noise data (Santoro et al., 2019). Similarly, Holt-Winters to retail sales data and reported consistent
forecast accuracy across seasonal demand cycles. In the context of e-commerce, where data volume
and temporal granularity are high, ARIMA and SARIMA are often employed in combination with
seasonal decomposition and preprocessing techniques to improve stability. Despite their reliance
on historical patterns, these models are still widely used in practice, especially for product lines with
stable demand and limited external shocks. The practical appeal of these models due to their lower
computational requirements and ease of deployment. Additionally, the viability of ARIMA in
forecasting apparel sales with moderate accuracy when seasonality and trend components are well-
defined.

However, these classical models assume linearity and stationarity, which limits their adaptability
in volatile and nonlinear settings typical of modern e-commerce. While useful for benchmarking
and understanding demand baselines, their forecasting performance tends to deteriorate when
faced with sudden promotions, stockouts, or consumer behavior shifts, as noted by Goltsos et al.,
(2018). Nevertheless, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters remain essential components in the
forecasting toolbox, particularly for businesses seeking transparency and computational efficiency.
Exponential smoothing methods represent one of the most widely adopted traditional forecasting
techniques, particularly suited for short-term demand forecasting where trends and seasonality can
be incrementally adjusted over time. These models assign exponentially decreasing weights to past
observations, giving more importance to recent data while smoothing out historical noise. Among
the most commonly applied variants are Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt’s Linear
Method (for trend), and Holt-Winters (for trend and seasonality), which are valued for their
simplicity and adaptability in forecasting scenarios with structured time components (Zhang et al.,
2023). Research has consistently validated the effectiveness of exponential smoothing models across
retail contexts. These models outperformed ARIMA in forecasting non-complex retail demand with
low volatility. A robust theoretical justification for exponential smoothing’s optimality in
minimizing forecast error under a mean-squared error loss function. A state-space framework for
exponential smoothing that enhanced its theoretical robustness and enabled probabilistic
forecasting.
In e-commerce settings, where short-term forecast accuracy is essential for inventory replenishment
and delivery planning, exponential smoothing is frequently used due to its low computational cost
and responsiveness to recent demand shifts (Jabareen, 2009). Holt-Winters to high-frequency
transaction data and demonstrated favorable outcomes in short-term forecast horizons. Exponential
smoothing performs well when product life cycles are mature and demand patterns are stable, a
common scenario for replenishable fast-moving consumer goods in e-retail platforms. However,
limitations arise when exponential smoothing is applied to products with erratic demand,
promotional spikes, or irregular sales cycles, which are increasingly common in online
marketplaces. While smoothing methods work well in steady-state conditions, their performance
deteriorates in the presence of discontinuities, particularly with low-sales or intermittent items.
Nevertheless, their speed, simplicity, and relatively good performance on short-term horizons
ensure exponential smoothing methods remain an industry standard, particularly when used in
conjunction with safety stock buffers and judgmental adjustments. Although traditional parametric
models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing have served as foundational
forecasting tools, their application in volatile e-commerce environments is increasingly constrained
by inherent methodological assumptions. These models are typically based on linearity,
stationarity, and fixed seasonal or trend structures—conditions rarely met in modern online retail
contexts characterized by rapid demand shifts, promotional events, and high product turnover
(Pandya & Pandya, 2015). One of the most frequently cited limitations is the inability of parametric
models to accommodate abrupt structural breaks or demand shocks, which are common during
flash sales, influencer marketing campaigns, or unexpected events like supply disruptions. Classical
models often underperform on datasets with high variance and nonstationarity. Moreover, the rigid
framework of ARIMA-type models necessitates intensive preprocessing such as differencing,
stationarity tests, and parameter tuning, which can become infeasible when forecasting thousands
of SKUs in real-time. Additionally, traditional models lack the ability to ingest and model
exogenous variables effectively, such as marketing spend, web traffic, or external macroeconomic
indicators. In contrast, machine learning models can readily incorporate such multidimensional
data inputs. Furthermore, parametric models are not well-suited for demand heterogeneity; they
tend to generalize poorly across product categories with highly varied demand dynamics (Ruzicska
et al., 2024). Using smoothing techniques for intermittent or lumpy demand items, which are
increasingly prevalent in e-commerce.
Interpretability, once considered a major advantage of parametric models, is also becoming less
relevant as businesses demand models that prioritize predictive power over transparency. Retail

non-promotional  periods  but  faltered  during  high-variance  sales  events.  Similarly,  Li  (2024)
benchmarked traditional models against machine learning algorithms in a retail inventory setting
and found that while classical methods provided better interpretability, they were generally less
accurate in capturing complex consumer behavior patterns. In e-grocery contexts, Alfarisi et al.
(2024) assessed multiple forecasting models for perishable goods and found that exponential
smoothing and SARIMA models provided stable results in highly seasonal categories. However,
the study also noted that these models failed to respond adequately to sudden shifts caused by
holidays  or  online  promotions.  Comparing  classical  and  AI  models  in  a  cloud-based  retail
forecasting competition, concluding that traditional models consistently underperformed in data-
rich,  high-variance  scenarios.  Benchmarking  studies  also  emphasize  the  trade-offs  between
interpretability,  implementation  cost,  and  forecasting  precision.  While  traditional  models  are
favored for their transparency and ease of deployment, they often serve best as baselines or
components within hybrid systems. Their continued evaluation in benchmarking studies affirms
their relevance but also underscores the need for augmentation with adaptive, nonlinear modeling
techniques in the fast-evolving digital retail landscape.
Machine Learning-Based Forecasting Models
Supervised learning algorithms have increasingly been adopted in demand forecasting for retail e-
commerce due to their flexibility, nonlinearity, and ability to incorporate diverse predictor variables
(Siddiqui, 2025; Sohel, 2025). Among these, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting
machines  (GBMs)  are  particularly  prominent.  Decision  trees  serve  as  intuitive  models  that
recursively partition the feature space to predict outcomes (Jakaria et al., 2025; Sarker, 2025).
Random forests, as ensembles of decision trees, reduce overfitting and improve generalization by
averaging multiple de-correlated tree outputs. GBMs, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, further
enhance performance by iteratively correcting errors from previous models using gradient descent
(Karl,  2024).  These  models  have  demonstrated  strong  performance  in  e-commerce  demand
forecasting. Gradient boosting to holiday sales forecasting, achieving superior accuracy compared
to traditional time series models (Khan, 2025; Md et al., 2025). XGBoost for short-term sales

prediction in e-commerce and reported significant improvements in root mean squared error
(RMSE) across multiple product categories (Islam et al., 2025; Saiful et al., 2025). Random forest
models have also been successfully used in inventory replenishment forecasting, as illustrated by
Samorani et al. (2016), where their ensemble structure mitigated the impact of outliers and volatile
demand.
The appeal of tree-based methods lies in their ability to handle categorical, numerical, and missing
data without extensive preprocessing (Helal et al., 2025; Islam et al., 2025). Additionally, they can
model complex interactions between features such as the joint impact of promotion and seasonality
without assuming linearity (Bhuiyan et al., 2025; Faria & Rashedul, 2025). Despite this, tree-based
supervised learning models remain robust, scalable solutions for demand forecasting in retail e-
commerce, particularly when high-dimensional and nonlinear data is involved (Razzaq & Shah,
2025). Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) represent additional
supervised learning methods that have found application in e-commerce demand forecasting due
to their nonparametric nature and flexibility (Shofiullah et al., 2024; Shipu et al., 2024). SVR, an
extension of Support Vector Machines for regression tasks, constructs a hyperplane in a high-
dimensional space to minimize forecast error within a defined margin (Sharif et al., 2024). Its kernel-
based approach enables the modeling of nonlinear relationships between input features and target
variables, making it suitable for capturing complex demand dynamics. k-NN, on the other hand, is
a distance-based, instance-learning algorithm that forecasts future demand by averaging the
outcomes of the k most similar past observations (Hossain et al., 2024; Roksana et al., 2024). Studies
have shown that SVR performs well in forecasting volatile e-commerce sales, especially for products
with short life cycles or erratic demand (Jahan, 2024; Islam et al., 2024). Policarpo et al. (2021)
demonstrated the effectiveness of SVR in B2C retail forecasting, outperforming ARIMA and
exponential smoothing in RMSE and MAPE. SVR to forecast daily transaction volumes in online
apparel sales, highlighting its sensitivity to sudden demand shifts (Hossain et al., 2024). SVR offered
superior accuracy compared to traditional models when promotional effects and external signals
were included.
k-NN, while simpler, has proven effective in capturing seasonal patterns and localized demand
trends in high-frequency retail data (Hasan et al., 2024). k-NN to forecast web-based sales and found
that its local learning approach outperformed global models during short-term horizons (Dey et al.,
2024). However, both SVR and k-NN have limitations related to computational complexity and
sensitivity to input scaling, particularly when dealing with large feature sets common in e-
commerce (Hosamo & Mazzetto, 2024). Their performance often depends heavily on
hyperparameter tuning and feature normalization, which may hinder their scalability across
thousands of SKUs (Dasgupta et al., 2024). Despite these challenges, SVR and k-NN remain relevant
in niche applications within e-commerce forecasting, especially for narrow product ranges or
contexts requiring rapid deployment and reasonable accuracy (Bhuiyan et al., 2024). Their
integration into ensemble frameworks or as benchmark models continues to enhance the
methodological diversity of machine learning-based forecasting in digital retail environments (Cui
et al., 2020).
Feature engineering plays a pivotal role in improving the predictive power of machine learning
models for demand forecasting, particularly in e-commerce settings where rich behavioral and
transactional data are readily available (Bhowmick & Shipu, 2024). Effective forecasting models
depend not only on the algorithmic architecture but also on the selection and transformation of
features that capture relevant demand drivers (Ammar et al., 2024). Behavioral features such as click
stream data, cart additions, and session duration offer real-time signals of purchase intent and
emerging trends (Yamamoto et al., 2019). Temporal features, including day-of-week, seasonality,
holidays, and lagged sales variables, help capture cyclical demand components (Siddiqui et al.,
2023). Promotion-related features, such as discount rates, marketing campaigns, and flash sales,
provide critical information about exogenous demand fluctuations (Shahan et al., 2023).

Several studies underscore the importance of feature engineering in boosting forecast accuracy.
Incorporating lagged promotional and temporal features into machine learning models significantly
improved demand forecasts in grocery e-commerce (Alam et al., 2023; Roksana, 2023; Sarker et al.,
2023). Engineering user interaction metrics and marketing channel effects led to higher precision in
predicting short-term demand using XGBoost (Jahan, 2023; Hossen et al., 2023).  Bekkerman et al.,
(2011) emphasized that model performance often hinges more on the quality of features than the
complexity of the algorithm, especially in high-dimensional e-commerce environments. Techniques
such as one-hot encoding, normalization, rolling window aggregations, and interaction terms are

| Nonetheless,  |             | feature  |
engineering is resource-intensive and requires domain knowledge to align data with business
realities (Mahfuj et al., 2022; Majharul et al., 2022). Automated feature engineering platforms,
though emerging, are not yet widely applied in retail forecasting. In sum, carefully crafted features
that reflect behavioral, temporal, and promotional aspects are essential for achieving competitive
forecasting performance in the e-commerce domain. Empirical evaluations of machine learning
models across real-world e-commerce datasets have provided important insights into their practical
viability, performance advantages, and implementation challenges (Ahmed et al., 2022; Aklima et
al., 2022). Multiple benchmark studies have compared machine learning algorithms including
decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, SVR, and neural networks against traditional time
series methods to assess forecast accuracy under realistic operational conditions (Islam & Helal,
2018). These studies often reveal that machine learning models outperform classical techniques,
particularly in short-term and high-frequency forecasting scenarios where nonlinearity, multiple
variables, and data volume are prevalent.
For instance, in a large-scale empirical comparison across several e-commerce retailers, Zahn et al.
(2022) found that gradient boosting and deep learning models consistently outperformed ARIMA
and exponential smoothing in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Similarly, ML models on
Alibaba’s product dataset and reported superior accuracy from XGBoost and LightGBM models,
particularly when contextual and promotional features were included. Ensemble models combining
machine learning and statistical forecasts yielded the most robust results in SKU-level forecasting
across  multiple  categories.  Real-world  evaluations  also  highlight  issues  of  scalability  and
computation time. While machine learning models provide strong predictive performance, their
deployment often requires significant computational infrastructure and frequent model retraining,
especially for large-scale e-commerce operations. Additionally, the need for automated model
selection and hyper parameter tuning to ensure generalizability across thousands of products.
Interpretability remains a concern in real-world deployments, where business stakeholders require
transparent models. However, explainable ML tools such as SHAP values, LIME, and feature
10

impact analysis have been used to bridge this gap. Despite these challenges, empirical studies
collectively validate that ML models, when carefully engineered and properly tuned, deliver
substantial accuracy gains, particularly in volatile and promotion-sensitive retail environments.
Deep Learning Models for Complex and Nonlinear Demand Patterns
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variants—Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)—are widely used deep learning models for
time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequential and temporal dependencies in data
(BhandariDhruv et al., 2020). In retail e-commerce, where demand data exhibits complex temporal
behavior such as seasonality, promotional cycles, and short-term trends, these models offer superior
flexibility over traditional time-series models. Unlike ARIMA or exponential smoothing, RNNs can
learn from long-range dependencies and nonlinear interactions across time without requiring
strong assumptions of data stationarity. Several empirical studies have demonstrated the
advantages of LSTM and GRU in forecasting e-commerce demand (Frei et al., 2022; Goedhart et al.,
2023; Razzaq & Shah, 2025). Frei et al. (2022) showed that LSTM outperforms shallow machine
learning models such as SVR and random forests in daily sales forecasting tasks involving large
feature sets. DeepAR, an LSTM-based probabilistic forecasting model, which has been widely
adopted in Amazon’s e-commerce forecasting pipelines due to its ability to model multiple time
series jointly. The winner of the M4 competition, introduced an LSTM-hybrid model that
performed exceptionally well across complex datasets involving multiple seasonal patterns. GRUs
are effective in high-frequency retail demand forecasting, achieving both speed and accuracy
advantages over traditional RNNs. Another notable integrated LSTM with external factors such as
marketing signals and weather data, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy for short-term
demand fluctuations. However, despite their strengths, RNN-based models suffer from vanishing
gradient problems and long training times, particularly for long time-series datasets. Additionally,
their black-box nature limits interpretability, which remains a concern in operational contexts
requiring transparency. Nevertheless, their adaptability to dynamic demand environments, ability
to capture intricate temporal relationships, and growing tool support make RNNs, LSTMs, and
GRUs central to modern forecasting systems in retail e-commerce.
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for Spatial and Pattern Recognition
While Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are traditionally associated with image and spatial
data analysis, they have been increasingly adapted for time-series forecasting due to their capacity
to capture local patterns and temporal dependencies through convolutional operations. In the
context of retail e-commerce, CNNs are particularly effective in identifying recurring demand
motifs, short-term promotional effects, and inter-variable dependencies embedded in multivariate
time-series data. Their parallelization capabilities and fast training cycles also make them suitable
for large-scale e-commerce applications. Yin et al. (2021) introduced a temporal CNN architecture
that outperformed RNNs in electricity demand forecasting, a result that has inspired similar
adaptations in retail demand prediction. CNNs to sales data from an online retailer and found
notable improvements in forecast accuracy, especially for high-turnover items. Joshi et al. (2018)
used CNNs to detect promotional demand bursts, capturing patterns that eluded traditional models
and even LSTMs. CNNs’ ability to process multiple time-series inputs, including sales, marketing
signals, and competitor pricing, without manual feature engineering.
One of the advantages of CNNs in demand forecasting is their ability to detect localized features
(e.g., short-term peaks and valleys) that may correspond to marketing campaigns or stock
availability issues. Mallick et al. (2022) emphasize how CNNs can act as efficient filters to extract
predictive features from noisy datasets typical of e-commerce environments. Furthermore, hybrid
models combining CNNs with LSTM or attention mechanisms have shown to outperform single
architectures. However, the application of CNNs in forecasting remains limited compared to RNNs
or Transformers, partly due to the challenge of adapting convolutional layers to inherently
sequential data structure. Yet, their computational efficiency and strong performance in short- to
mid-term prediction tasks make them an emerging tool in the deep learning repertoire for e-
commerce forecasting.
11

Transformer-based architectures and attention mechanisms represent the most recent innovations
in time-series forecasting, offering a powerful alternative to recurrent structures by allowing models
to focus on relevant parts of the sequence dynamically. Unlike RNNs, which process data
sequentially, transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to evaluate all time points in parallel,
significantly improving training efficiency and scalability in large datasets. This capability is
particularly valuable in retail e-commerce, where real-time forecasting of thousands of SKUs is
required. Recent studies have successfully adapted transformers for demand forecasting. The
Informer model, a transformer variant optimized for long-sequence time-series forecasting, which
achieved state-of-the-art performance across retail datasets. The Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), capable of handling static, temporal, and known future inputs, with integrated
interpretability through attention weights. TFT has been applied in several commercial forecasting
systems due to its ability to identify which features influence future demand most significantly.
Attention mechanisms themselves have also been embedded into hybrid LSTM and CNN models
to enhance temporal focus. Attention-based LSTM networks could more accurately capture event-
driven sales fluctuations, such as product launches and influencer promotions. Similarly, Melacini
et al. (2018) applied attention-enhanced deep models to e-commerce SKU forecasting and reported
significant improvements in MAPE over traditional RNN baselines. Despite their advantages,
transformers demand substantial computational resources and careful tuning of hyper parameters.
Their complexity may also hinder deployment in low-resource environments or small businesses
lacking the infrastructure for deep learning pipelines. Nonetheless, the empirical evidence supports
their superior performance, especially in multivariate forecasting with exogenous features, making
them an increasingly critical tool in demand forecasting for e-commerce.
The real-world application of deep learning models in e-commerce forecasting hinges not only on
predictive accuracy but also on model scalability, latency, and deployment feasibility. E-commerce
platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart operate in high-frequency, multi-SKU
environments where forecasts must be updated in near real-time to support dynamic pricing,
inventory allocation, and delivery scheduling. In such contexts, the operationalization of models
like LSTM, CNN, and Transformers involves challenges related to computation cost, inference time,
and data integration. While deep learning models outperform traditional approaches in accuracy,
they often require extensive training cycles, GPU infrastructure, and data pipeline orchestration,
making them difficult to scale without substantial engineering effort. Minor delays in model
inference can compromise the business value of forecasting in flash sale environments, where
decisions are required within minutes. Moreover, the variance in performance across products
necessitates customized model configurations, further complicating batch deployment strategies.
To address these issues, several approaches have emerged. Model compression techniques, such as
knowledge distillation and quantization, have been used to reduce inference time in production
systems. Cloud-native solutions like Amazon Forecast and Google Vertex AI offer managed services
for real-time demand forecasting using deep models with minimal infrastructure overhead. Studies
by ArunKumar et al. (2021) highlight how streaming architectures and real-time data ingestion
improve forecast timeliness without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, operational deployment
often involves ensemble systems that combine deep learning models with simpler baselines for
fallback accuracy and robustness. Attention-based transformers, such as the TFT, have
demonstrated both scalability and interpretability, allowing for practical integration in decision
support systems. Despite the complexity, deep learning models continue to deliver value in high-
volume e-commerce applications where forecasting errors translate directly into inventory
misallocations and lost sales.
Hybrid Forecasting Models: Merging Statistical and AI Paradigms
Hybrid forecasting models that combine traditional statistical methods like ARIMA with machine
learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches have gained prominence in retail e-commerce due
to their ability to harness the strengths of both paradigms. ARIMA models are well-suited for
capturing linear, trend-based components of time-series data, whereas ML and DL models excel at
detecting nonlinearities and interactions with exogenous variables (Li, 2024). The motivation for
12

Vol 6, No 1, March 2025
https://doi.org/10.63125/mbbfw637
hybridization stems from the limitations of each approach when applied in isolation. While ARIMA
performs reliably for stable demand patterns, it struggles with abrupt shifts; ML/DL models,
although powerful, often require large training datasets and may be overfit in data-sparse
environments. A common hybrid design involves decomposing the time series into linear and
nonlinear components, forecasting the linear part with ARIMA and the residuals with ML or DL
models. ARIMA-ANN hybrids consistently outperform single models in accuracy metrics such as
RMSE and MAPE. In e-commerce contexts, improved forecast precision using hybrid ARIMA-ML
models for highly seasonal product categories.
Mallick et al. (2022) applied an ARIMA-LSTM hybrid to Amazon product data and reported
significant reductions in forecasting error, particularly in flash sale scenarios. Similarly, hybrid
models improve resilience in datasets with abrupt structural breaks, such as promotional spikes or
stock out recoveries. The effectiveness of these models hinges on appropriate residual modeling and
error decomposition, making them

yielding superior results. While
implementation complexity remains a
barrier, hybrid ARIMA-ML/DL models
offer a flexible solution to the diverse
forecasting challenges in digital
commerce, striking a balance between
interpretability and predictive accuracy.
Ensemble learning techniques combine
multiple forecasting models to enhance
robustness, reduce variance, and improve
accuracy under uncertainty. In retail e-
commerce, where demand is often affected
by unpredictable events such as flash
sales, external disruptions, and changing
consumer behavior, ensembles help
mitigate the risks associated with relying
on a single model (Shen et al., 2021).
Ensembles may be homogeneous (e.g.,
bagging with decision trees) or
heterogeneous (e.g., combining ARIMA,
random forests, and LSTM), with the goal
of exploiting model diversity to capture
different facets of the data.
Bagging, boosting, and stacking are commonly used ensemble strategies. Random forests, which
rely on bagging, offer strong performance for SKU-level forecasting, especially when feature noise
is high. Gradient boosting methods like XGBoost and Light GBM have been extensively used to
enhance short-term demand forecasting in e-commerce due to their high accuracy and
interpretability. Stacked generalization, which blends the predictions of base learners using a meta-
model, has been applied successfully in studies by Alghamdi (2023), revealing significant
performance improvements across volatile product categories.
Empirical research supports ensemble superiority. Ensemble models consistently outperform
individual learners across diverse demand patterns and forecasting horizons. Forecasts were more
robust against outliers and reduced over fitting, particularly in small-sample contexts. Hybrid
ensembles where statistical models like ARIMA are blended with ML/DL models have been shown
to outperform standalone deep learning models in high-uncertainty environments. However,
ensemble models require greater computational resources and present challenges in terms of model
selection, hyper parameter tuning, and interpretability. Despite these barriers, ensemble learning
represents a powerful methodology for managing demand uncertainty in e-commerce by increasing
13

resilience and performance consistency across diverse retail conditions. Multi-model forecasting
pipelines are increasingly employed in retail e-commerce to address the multifactorial nature of
demand, especially in the presence of seasonality, promotional campaigns, and event-driven
fluctuations. These pipelines combine models in a sequential or modular architecture, where each
model component is responsible for capturing a specific aspect of the demand signal. This
modularization allows for a more nuanced understanding and response to demand drivers,
particularly when dealing with SKU-level granularity and varied promotional sensitivities. One
approach involves decomposing the time series into baseline demand, seasonal effects, and event-
related impacts, then using separate models (e.g., ARIMA for seasonality, gradient boosting for
promotional impacts) to forecast each component. Using DeepAR to model baseline sales while
integrating exogenous inputs for promotions and price discounts. The Temporal Fusion
Transformer (TFT) to handle multiple variable types static, temporal, and known future events in a
single end-to-end pipeline, achieving high interpretability and precision. Retail-specific
applications reinforce the value of multi-model pipelines. Pipelines integrating CNNs for short-term
promotional bursts and LSTM layers for seasonal patterns yielded superior performance on high-
frequency fashion sales data. Using event flags and dummy variables in tandem with ML models
substantially improved forecasting accuracy during promotional weeks. The complexity of
integrating multi-model pipelines lies in feature engineering, synchronization of model outputs,
and real-time implementation (Chen, 2022). Despite this, their adaptability and superior
performance in modeling composite demand signals have led to increased adoption in dynamic e-
commerce settings, especially where personalized marketing, event timing, and holiday effects are
significant demand drivers (Alghamdi, 2023). Comparative evaluation of hybrid forecasting models
is critical to determine their effectiveness, generalizability, and suitability for specific retail
scenarios. Hybrid models comprising statistical, machine learning, or deep learning elements—are
assessed using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE), along with
advanced metrics like the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for probabilistic forecasts.
Shen et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive review of hybrid forecasting methods across retail
applications and found that models combining ARIMA and LSTM consistently outperformed both
in terms of MAE and RMSE, particularly for volatile product categories. Deep learning ensembles
with hybrid models and found that hybrid approaches yielded lower forecasting errors across 70%
of SKUs in a multi-retailer dataset. Similarly, ARIMA-XGBoost hybrids achieved better accuracy
during seasonal peaks than standalone ML models. Empirical evaluations also explore forecast
stability and explainability. Hybrid models-maintained accuracy without sacrificing
interpretability, especially when statistical models were used to generate baseline forecasts. Hybrid
models provided greater robustness to outliers and maintained lower variance in prediction
intervals. Model selection in comparative studies also considers computational efficiency. While
deep models may achieve slightly better accuracy, hybrid models often require less training data
and provide faster inference times, especially in ensemble configurations. Furthermore, studies
emphasize the importance of business alignment, recommending model evaluations be tailored to
use cases—such as daily versus weekly forecasting, or stable versus promotional products. Overall,
comparative studies confirm the efficacy of hybrid models in balancing complexity, accuracy, and
operational feasibility, making them well-suited to the multifaceted forecasting needs of retail e-
commerce.
Integration of External and Contextual Data Sources
The integration of external variables such as weather conditions, macroeconomic indicators, and
social media signals has significantly expanded the scope and accuracy of demand forecasting in e-
commerce. These variables provide context-sensitive information that complements internal
transactional data and helps explain sudden demand shifts or latent consumer behaviors. Weather
data, for instance, is particularly relevant for forecasting sales of seasonal items such as apparel,
beverages, and outdoor goods. Studies by Alghamdi (2023) demonstrated that temperature,
precipitation, and humidity can be strong predictors of sales fluctuations, especially in regions
14

where climate variability is high.
Economic indicators, including consumer confidence indices, unemployment rates, and disposable
income levels, offer insight into long-term demand patterns. Incorporating GDP trends and interest
rates improved demand forecasting accuracy in categories such as electronics and luxury goods.
Similarly, including inflation-adjusted economic variables led to better mid-term sales forecasts for
durable goods on e-commerce platforms (Shen et al., 2021). Social media signals, such as likes,
shares, and comments, act as proxies for real-time consumer sentiment and attention. For example,
Twitter data to forecast product sales, revealing a high correlation between online buzz and short-
term demand. Incorporated blog
mentions and social news streams into Figure 8: Incorporating External Signals in Demand

forecasting models, improving early
demand detection for new product
launches. The rise of influencer
marketing and viral campaigns further
amplifies the predictive power of social
media activity, especially for trend-
sensitive products like fashion or
cosmetics. Although external data
introduces complexity into modeling, its
integration has been shown to
significantly enhance forecast accuracy
and responsiveness in dynamic e-
commerce settings. As such, hybrid and
AI-enhanced models are increasingly
designed to accommodate structured
and unstructured external variables for
more holistic and context-aware
forecasting.
Textual and sentiment data derived from
consumer reviews, product feedback, and social media platforms have emerged as valuable inputs
in demand forecasting, particularly in environments where traditional sales signals are insufficient.
Such unstructured data sources offer insights into consumer satisfaction, intentions, and future
behavior, which are otherwise difficult to quantify through numerical transactions. Sentiment
analysis, a subset of natural language processing (NLP), allows organizations to transform
qualitative text into quantifiable features that can be incorporated into forecasting models
(Alghamdi, 2023).
Numerous studies have demonstrated the predictive utility of sentiment-enhanced models.
Amazon product reviews and showed that positive sentiment trends often precede sales spikes,
while negative feedback can predict demand decline. Similarly, Twitter sentiment to forecast
fashion demand, achieving higher forecasting accuracy when sentiment features were added to
baseline models. Incorporating textual data from blogs and forums also yields predictive value. For
example, sentiment extracted from blog posts predicted box office performance more accurately
than historical sales data alone. Advanced deep learning models have further enhanced the
processing of textual data. Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and BERT, allow models to
understand semantic nuances and contextual relationships in consumer-generated content. Textual
review sentiment into LSTM models and observed significant reductions in RMSE across multiple
product categories. A hybrid forecasting system using textual features from customer Q&A forums,
which proved valuable in explaining demand volatility during product launches. However,
challenges remain in preprocessing text, dealing with sarcasm or ambiguous language, and aligning
sentiment signals with sales timeframes (Shen et al., 2021). Despite these limitations, textual and
sentiment data enhance demand forecasting by capturing the "why" behind consumer behavior,
making them an essential asset in the e-commerce forecasting toolkit.

Application-Centric Studies in Inventory and Delivery Planning
Forecasting accuracy plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of inventory management
systems by directly influencing stockout and overstock rates. Stockouts, which lead to missed sales
opportunities and customer dissatisfaction, and overstocks, which increase holding costs and risk
of obsolescence, are both symptomatic of inaccurate demand projections (Hevner et al., 2004). In the
context of e-commerce, where demand is volatile and fulfillment timelines are compressed, even
minor forecasting errors can have significant ripple effects across the supply chain. Numerous
empirical studies underscore this relationship. A 10% improvement in forecast accuracy could
reduce inventory costs by as much as 25%. Similarly, demand signal amplification resulting from
poor forecasts leads to increased bullwhip effects, amplifying fluctuations in upstream inventory.
Intermittent demand items, often found in long-tail e-commerce categories, are especially
vulnerable to stockouts without specialized forecasting models (Mallick et al., 2022). Advanced
machine learning models significantly reduce forecast errors, thereby minimizing stock imbalances.
These findings by comparing ARIMA, LSTM, and hybrid models and found that deep learning
models reduced overstock rates in high-SKU environments by up to 15%. The role of real-time data
integration in reducing forecast lags and

Replenishment Decisions

forecasts enable more efficient safety
stock calculation, allowing firms to
balance service levels and capital
constraints. Align forecasting systems
with inventory policies exhibit
significantly lower stock imbalances and
improved profitability (Ashton &
Prybutok, 2020). Thus, demand
forecasting serves not only as a planning
function but as a strategic lever for
inventory optimization in digital
commerce. Predictive modeling has
become essential in inventory
replenishment planning, enabling firms to
anticipate demand and align procurement
schedules accordingly. Traditional
replenishment strategies relied on fixed
reorder points and economic order
quantity (EOQ) models, which often fell
short in dynamic, high-frequency e-
commerce settings (Tibben-Lembke &
Rogers, 2002). Predictive analytics,
incorporating machine learning and
hybrid approaches, allows for real-time,
SKU-specific replenishment decisions based on evolving demand patterns, lead time variability,
and customer behavior (Konstantopoulos et al., 2022).
Recent studies have highlighted how predictive models enhance replenishment accuracy. Retailers
adopting demand-driven replenishment systems achieved higher inventory turnover and service
levels. The model significantly outperformed heuristic-based systems in reducing inventory cost
and out-of-stock incidents. Using deep learning models, particularly LSTM, which captured short-
term demand signals and improved replenishment precision for promotional and seasonal items.
Advanced techniques like reinforcement learning have also been explored for dynamic
replenishment. (Gong, 2023) implemented a reinforcement learning framework that continuously

holding costs. Used hybrid ARIMA-ML pipelines to forecast demand and inform reorder intervals,
achieving improved service levels without excessive safety stock. Predictive modeling also supports
supplier collaboration by generating demand forecasts that can be shared upstream, enhancing
visibility and reducing bullwhip effects. Additionally, the integration of point-of-sale (POS) data,
promotional calendars, and weather forecasts into predictive systems allows for proactive inventory
adjustment before demand materializes. Therefore, predictive modeling in inventory replenishment
not only reduces operational inefficiencies but also contributes to agile, customer-centric supply
chain practices that are essential for competitive advantage in retail e-commerce (Strebinger &
Treiblmaier, 2024).
In e-commerce logistics, forecasting not only drives procurement and inventory decisions but also
plays a critical role in delivery scheduling and route optimization. As customers increasingly
demand same-day or next-day delivery, logistics systems must be highly responsive to demand
signals to ensure timely and cost-effective fulfillment. Forecast-driven logistics systems use
predicted order volumes and delivery locations to plan delivery windows, assign carriers, and
optimize last-mile routing. The value of integrating demand forecasts into delivery planning.
Incorporating short-term sales forecasts into route planning models improved vehicle utilization
and reduced delivery delays (Melacini et al., 2018). A deep learning model that combined demand
forecasts with vehicle capacity constraints and customer time windows, significantly enhancing
delivery reliability in urban areas. Ensemble models to forecast demand peaks, allowing dynamic
allocation of delivery resources during promotional events. Integrating forecast data into logistics
systems reduces both delivery cost and service failures (Konstantopoulos et al., 2022). LSTM
networks to model short-term order volumes by region and time of day, which allowed for dynamic
delivery scheduling. Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) to generate time- and location-sensitive
forecasts that informed warehouse-to-customer routing decisions. Forecast-driven logistics also
supports warehouse slotting and cross-docking, enabling more accurate picking schedules and
dispatch planning. However, the effectiveness of such systems relies heavily on real-time data
availability and the ability to integrate forecasting outputs with transportation management
systems.
METHOD
This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines to ensure a systematic, transparent, and rigorous review process. The PRISMA
framework was implemented to enhance the clarity, reproducibility, and scientific quality of this
review, providing a structured method for identifying, selecting, evaluating, and synthesizing
research on demand forecasting models in the context of retail e-commerce.
The review process began with a well-defined objective: to examine the breadth and depth of
forecasting techniques employed in retail e-commerce and to assess their implications for inventory
planning and delivery optimization. Based on this objective, a detailed protocol was designed to
guide the review. This included establishing eligibility criteria, designing search strategies, and
defining the data extraction and synthesis approach. To identify relevant literature, a
comprehensive search was conducted across several major academic databases, including Scopus,
Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Supplementary searches were performed through
Google Scholar and targeted conference proceedings to capture gray literature and state-of-the-art
methodologies. The search focused on articles published between 2010 and 2024 and employed
keyword combinations such as "demand forecasting," "retail e-commerce," "inventory

After retrieval, all articles were imported
Figure 10: Adopted Methodology for this study
into a reference management system,
where duplicates were removed. An initial
total of 284 articles were screened by title
and abstract to evaluate their relevance to
the study’s objectives. Studies were
retained if they met the following inclusion
criteria: (1) the study evaluated one or
more demand forecasting methods in the
context of retail or e-commerce, (2) it
contained empirical data and performance
evaluation using forecasting accuracy
metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, or MAE,
and (3) the research was published in
English in a peer-reviewed journal or
reputable conference proceeding. Papers
that focused solely on physical retail,
theoretical model development without
application, or lacking methodological
transparency were excluded. This
screening process narrowed the selection
to 134 articles, which were then subjected
to a full-text review.
The full-text screening aimed to validate
each study’s methodological rigor,
relevance to e-commerce forecasting, and
connection to inventory or delivery
management applications. The quality
assessment considered data sources,
model clarity, reproducibility of results,
and alignment with e-commerce-specific
operational issues. At the conclusion of
this phase, 72 studies were deemed eligible
for inclusion in the systematic review. These studies covered a diverse range of forecasting
approaches, including traditional statistical methods like ARIMA and Holt-Winters, machine
learning techniques such as random forests and gradient boosting, deep learning models including
LSTM and CNNs, as well as hybrid and ensemble methods.
For each of the 72 included studies, key data were extracted using a structured coding framework.
The extracted variables included author(s), publication year, forecasting technique(s) used, dataset
characteristics (product category, granularity, volume), the operational focus (inventory, logistics,
or delivery), accuracy metrics reported, and any external/contextual variables considered (e.g.,
weather, sentiment, promotional data). These data were synthesized thematically to draw
comparisons across forecasting methods and identify patterns in model performance, applicability,
and limitations. To ensure methodological integrity and minimize bias, the review process was
conducted independently by multiple reviewers. Discrepancies during screening and data
extraction were resolved through discussion and consensus. This systematic review, guided by
PRISMA, provides a comprehensive and unbiased synthesis of forecasting practices in e-commerce,
offering a reliable foundation for academic inquiry and practical implementation.
FINDINGS
One of the most significant findings of this systematic review is the continued relevance and
adaptability of traditional statistical models in retail e-commerce forecasting. Despite the growing
dominance of machine learning and deep learning techniques, traditional models such as ARIMA,
18

Vol 6, No 1, March 2025
https://doi.org/10.63125/mbbfw637
SARIMA, and Holt-Winters were employed in 21 of the 72 reviewed studies. These models were
frequently used as baselines or integrated into hybrid frameworks due to their interpretability and
low computational cost. Articles employing ARIMA-based forecasting received over 2,300
cumulative citations, indicating sustained scholarly attention and practical application. These
models performed well in contexts characterized by stable, seasonal demand and short forecasting
horizons. They were especially effective for replenishable products with predictable consumption
patterns. However, their limitations in handling nonlinearity, external disruptions, and high-
frequency data were repeatedly acknowledged. Despite their simplicity, the widespread use and
high citation frequency of these studies underscore the foundational role traditional models
continue to play in benchmarking and hybrid development within demand forecasting systems.

The second key finding concerns the growing dominance of machine learning models in e-
commerce demand forecasting. Of the 72 studies reviewed, 31 utilized supervised machine learning
algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector
regression, and k-nearest neighbors. These studies amassed over 4,800 citations collectively,
reflecting the strong academic and practical impact of machine learning-driven forecasting. These
models demonstrated high levels of adaptability, outperforming traditional methods in
environments marked by complex consumer behavior, high SKU diversity, and promotional
volatility. Machine learning models were especially effective in short-term and medium-term
forecasting horizons, often improving accuracy metrics such as RMSE and MAPE by up to 20% over
statistical methods. Several studies integrated exogenous variables, such as marketing spend,
competitor pricing, and web traffic, into these models, revealing their strength in multivariate
forecasting. Their predictive power was complemented by ensemble strategies that enhanced
19

Vol 6, No 1, March 2025
https://doi.org/10.63125/mbbfw637
robustness across volatile demand cycles. These findings affirm that machine learning models are
not only widely adopted but are also shaping the core methodology in real-world retail analytics
platforms.
A third significant finding involves the rapidly growing implementation of deep learning models,
particularly those based on LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures. These models appeared in 22 of
the reviewed studies, which together accounted for over 3,900 citations, indicating both their
methodological sophistication and growing influence in the field. Deep learning models excelled in
capturing long-term dependencies, dynamic demand fluctuations, and nonlinear relationships,
especially in high-volume, high-frequency e-commerce data streams. LSTM and GRU models were
frequently used for time-series demand forecasting, often combined with exogenous data sources
like sentiment analysis, pricing, or weather conditions. CNN-based models demonstrated strong
performance in detecting local patterns, especially in data with short-term promotional spikes.
Moreover, attention-based models and transformers began to appear in the most recent studies,
showing promising results in long-sequence forecasting tasks. Across these 22 studies, deep
learning models consistently delivered superior accuracy for SKUs with erratic, intermittent, or
trend-sensitive behavior. These models, while often more computationally intensive, provided a
competitive advantage in fast-scaling digital retail environments, with multiple studies reporting
implementation in production-level systems within multinational e-commerce platforms.
The fourth finding highlights the strategic value and increasing popularity of hybrid forecasting
models that merge traditional and AI-based methods. Hybrid models were the focus of 18 reviewed
studies, which received approximately 2,500 combined citations. These models leveraged the
strengths of classical approaches like ARIMA for capturing linear trends and seasonality, while
using machine learning or deep learning techniques to model residual errors or nonlinearities.
Several studies adopted two-stage modeling architectures, where one model captured the main
demand signal and another corrected deviations. These hybrid approaches showed notable
improvements in forecasting accuracy, especially during promotional periods, product launches,
and external disruptions. Moreover, hybrid models often addressed the limitations of standalone
deep learning systems by improving interpretability and reducing overfitting. Their modular nature
allowed for domain-specific customization, which made them appealing for applications in
inventory optimization, short-term fulfillment planning, and multi-location demand aggregation.
The empirical success and moderate citation volume of these studies suggest that hybridization
offers a balanced, scalable path forward for organizations seeking robust forecasting solutions.
The final and perhaps most transformative finding relates to the integration of external and
contextual data into forecasting models, a practice that was present in 27 of the 72 studies and
collectively earned more than 5,000 citations. These studies incorporated variables such as weather,
holidays, economic indicators, customer reviews, clickstream data, and social media activity. This
contextualization of forecasting enabled models to adapt to real-world fluctuations and
unpredictable demand surges. Models enriched with external data consistently outperformed those
reliant solely on historical sales, particularly in scenarios involving flash sales, regional holidays,
and influencer marketing campaigns. Sentiment analysis and textual features from consumer-
generated content were notably effective for predicting demand in apparel, electronics, and lifestyle
products. Additionally, real-time data fusion from IoT sensors, web traffic, and transaction logs
allowed for continuous model updates and high-frequency forecast generation. This capability was
especially valuable for platforms managing large SKU catalogs and omnichannel operations. The
extensive citation impact of these studies underscores a paradigm shift in forecasting methodology,
moving from reactive, history-based models to proactive, context-aware systems. These findings
reinforce that external data integration is not a mere enhancement but a necessity in achieving
operational accuracy and resilience in modern retail e-commerce.
DISCUSSION
The present review affirms that traditional statistical models, particularly ARIMA, SARIMA, and
exponential smoothing methods, continue to play a vital foundational role in demand forecasting
for retail e-commerce. Despite their conceptual simplicity, their inclusion in 21 of the 72 reviewed
20

studies reflects ongoing relevance, particularly for use cases involving stable demand environments
and short-term forecasting horizons (Gong, 2023). This finding aligns with earlier observations that
these models perform robustly under stationary conditions and are often integrated into hybrid
frameworks due to their interpretability. The M4 competition similarly demonstrated that statistical
models serve as reliable baselines in both academic research and industry application (Strebinger &
Treiblmaier, 2024). However, this review found limitations in their ability to handle sudden demand
volatility, promotional campaigns, and complex nonlinear behavior features that increasingly
characterize the modern e-commerce environment. Thus, while traditional models offer value in
terms of computational efficiency and transparency, their solo application is often inadequate for
dynamic digital retail settings (Melacini et al., 2018).
The increasing dominance of machine learning (ML) techniques in e-commerce forecasting is one of
the most marked developments highlighted in this review. The strong performance of supervised
models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines aligns with earlier
research to capture complex feature interactions and model multivariate dependencies. The
reviewed studies confirm that these models consistently outperform traditional ones in contexts
marked by promotional variation, high product diversity, and behavioral data integration.
Moreover, the empirical results mirror conclusions drawn by Asamoah et al. (2021), who
emphasized the flexibility and adaptability of ML models when dealing with external variables like
pricing, advertising, and competitor activity. However, this review also reinforces earlier concerns
about model overfitting and the need for extensive feature engineering. These findings suggest that
ML models offer superior predictive power but require robust data infrastructure, tuning, and
domain knowledge to reach their full potential (Shen et al., 2021).
Deep learning models, particularly those based on LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures, have
emerged as powerful tools for addressing the nonlinear and high-frequency nature of e-commerce
demand. LSTM networks excel in long-sequence forecasting and capturing temporal dependencies
in large-scale, multivariate datasets (Razzaq & Shah, 2025). The inclusion of CNN models for
demand pattern detection in short promotional cycles echoes, who advocated for CNNs in financial
and retail time-series analysis. Additionally, this review found strong support for transformer-
based models, such as the Temporal Fusion Transformer, which have proven highly effective in
integrating static, temporal, and known future inputs. The increasing popularity of these models
reflects a shift toward more flexible architectures capable of processing real-time and contextual
data, as discussed. Nonetheless, deep learning methods are not without limitations. r complexity
and computational demands pose barriers to adoption for smaller enterprises. The current review
concurs, noting that while deep learning models offer the highest accuracy levels, their
interpretability and scalability remain challenging without specialized technical infrastructure (Frei
et al., 2022).
A significant trend in the reviewed literature is the integration of hybrid forecasting models,
combining traditional statistical approaches with modern ML/DL methods. This mirrors earlier
work by Goedhart et al. (2023), who advocated for two-stage hybrid models that blend linear and
nonlinear components. The reviewed studies confirm that such hybrids achieve enhanced accuracy
by leveraging the strengths of each approach: statistical models for trend and seasonality, and
ML/DL models for residual and external variable modeling. These findings are in agreement with
Guo et al. (2021), who emphasized the robustness and contextual adaptability of hybrid
architectures. However, this review found that hybrid models are often underutilized in operational
systems due to their design complexity and maintenance overhead. While Zhai and Zhang, (2023)
found limited performance improvements from hybrids in controlled experiments, this review
suggests that in real-world e-commerce settings—where demand patterns are influenced by many
interacting variables—hybrids consistently outperform standalone models. Thus, hybridization
presents a promising middle path between transparency and predictive precision, particularly
when interpretability is as important as forecast accuracy.
The integration of external and contextual data—such as weather, economic indicators, social media
signals, and sentiment analysis—emerged as a major differentiator in forecasting performance. This
21

International Journal of Scientific Interdisciplinary Research
Vol 6, No 1, March 2025
https://doi.org/10.63125/mbbfw637
reflects growing alignment with studies by John et al. (2020) who emphasized the predictive power
of social sentiment and consumer-generated content. In contrast to earlier forecasting models that
relied solely on historical sales data, this review found that studies incorporating real-time
behavioral signals achieved significantly higher accuracy in volatile, promotion-sensitive categories
such as fashion and electronics. These findings also support Frei et al. (2022), who argued that
sentiment-aware models bridge the gap between structured analytics and consumer psychology.
Moreover, the successful integration of external data in deep learning architectures, such as
transformers and LSTM networks, illustrates an evolution in model design and data engineering.
However, the review also identifies a persistent gap in methodological transparency and
standardization of external data preprocessing, echoing concerns from Benleulmi et al. (2025).
Despite the growing evidence of performance benefits, organizations still face challenges related to
data quality, latency, and model explainability when using unstructured or third-party data.
This review further reinforces the operational importance of accurate demand forecasting in
inventory optimization and delivery scheduling. The linkage between forecast precision and
reduced stockout or overstock rates, as observed in multiple reviewed studies, supports prior
findings by Goedhart et al. (2023) as well as Guo et al. (2021). Moreover, the incorporation of
forecasting into replenishment automation aligns with the work of Mosavi et al. (2020), who stressed
the cost-reduction potential of predictive replenishment systems. The use of forecast-driven route
optimization and delivery scheduling—highlighted in studies from Amazon, Alibaba, and
Walmart—builds upon foundational logistics research by Usmani et al. (2024) extending its
application to real-time, high-volume e-commerce environments. This review confirms that the
most competitive retail platforms are those that seamlessly integrate forecasting with inventory
allocation, route planning, and warehouse slotting. These applications transform forecasting from
a back-end planning tool into a real-time operational driver, aligning with the demand for agility
and responsiveness in digital supply chains.
Lastly, the case studies from leading global platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart offer
empirical validation of the most successful forecasting strategies identified in the review. These case
studies corroborate trends reported by Li and Wang (2020), and BhandariDhruv et al. (2020), who
noted that enterprise-level implementation of LSTM-based forecasting, combined with contextual
data integration and probabilistic modeling, has become an industry norm. The systematic use of
forecasting to support pre-positioning, dynamic delivery scheduling, and cross-border inventory
management illustrates the practical benefits of methodological innovation. Regional players such
as Mercado Libre and Jumia offer additional perspectives, highlighting the adaptability of
forecasting models in resource-constrained environments. These examples echo findings that
technological scalability and data localization are key to forecasting effectiveness in emerging
markets. Together, these insights suggest that while forecasting methodologies vary in complexity
and data requirements, their strategic integration into supply chain and operational workflows is a
defining characteristic of retail success in the digital age.
CONCLUSION
This systematic review of 72 peer-reviewed studies provides a comprehensive synthesis of demand
forecasting models in retail e-commerce, highlighting the evolution from traditional statistical
methods to advanced machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. The findings
underscore that while classical models like ARIMA and Holt-Winters remain useful for baseline
forecasting in stable demand environments, they are increasingly outperformed by machine
learning and deep learning models in volatile, data-rich contexts. Supervised learning algorithms
offer flexibility and superior accuracy, particularly when integrated with external variables such as
pricing, promotions, and web behavior, while deep learning models like LSTM and transformer-
based architectures demonstrate strong capabilities in capturing nonlinearities and long-term
dependencies in multivariate time-series data. Hybrid models combining statistical and AI
paradigms emerge as a balanced solution, leveraging interpretability and complexity where needed.
Additionally, the integration of contextual and real-time data ranging from weather patterns and
economic indicators to sentiment and clickstream data was found to significantly enhance forecast

performance and operational responsiveness. Practical applications in inventory optimization and
logistics planning, including successful implementations by Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart,
further validate the impact of advanced forecasting systems on reducing stockouts, optimizing
replenishment, and improving delivery precision. Collectively, this review not only maps the
current state of demand forecasting in e-commerce but also reinforces its strategic role in aligning
inventory and logistics decisions with the rapidly evolving behavior of online consumers.

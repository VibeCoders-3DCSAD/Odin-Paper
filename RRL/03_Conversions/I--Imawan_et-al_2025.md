1. INTRODUCTION

The rapid advancement of digital technology has transformed modern life, bringing both opportunities
and  challenges  across  various  sectors,  particularly  in  personal  finance  [1],  [2],  [3].  Personal  finance

management  has  become  critical,  especially  for  young  adults  facing  unique  financial  challenges  in
today’s  economy.  Financial  literacy  and  responsible  financial  behavior  are  increasingly  important,
especially after the pandemic’s economic impact [4], [5]. As of December 2021, Indonesians aged 19-
34 accounted for 63% of online loan users, according to the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia
(OJK), with a significant concentration in urban areas. This demographic, composed mainly of students
and early-career individuals, is vulnerable to financial mismanagement due to limited experience and
guidance  in  financial  decision-making  [6],  [7].  A  survey  among  Informatics  Education  students  at
Universitas Negeri Padang highlighted this issue, showing that fewer than 50% consistently recorded
their  finances,  just  20%  regularly  reviewed  income  and  expenses,  and  merely  40%  adhered  to  a
monthly budget.

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of financial literacy,  there remains a practical gap  in
using tools tailored to engage and empower young adults in managing their finances effectively. Many
existing financial management tools are designed for a general audience, often overlooking the unique
needs and behaviors of younger users, who are more inclined toward interactive, mobile-first solutions
[8], [9]. Although prior studies have established the importance of financial literacy, few have explored
how  a  targeted  mobile  application  can  directly  influence  and  improve  financial  habits  among  young
Indonesian adults [10], [11].

Addressing this gap is crucial since financial behaviors established in early adulthood have significant
long-term implications. The prevalence of high online loan usage among young Indonesians highlights
an  urgent  need  for  tools  that  encourage  responsible  financial  habits  [12],  [13].  Without  timely
intervention, financial literacy deficits may perpetuate a cycle of debt and instability. By providing a
mobile solution that promotes consistent financial tracking and budgeting, this study  intends to instill
positive financial behaviors early on, establishing a foundation for financial resilience.

This study aims to develop an Android-based personal finance management application tailored to the
needs  of  young  adults,  equipped  with  features  for  tracking  income,  setting  budgets,  monitoring
expenses, and establishing financial goals. It further evaluates the application’s usability and its impact
on  users’  financial  behaviors,  focusing  on  fostering  consistent  engagement  and  improving  financial
literacy. The research questions guiding this study are as follows:

1)  How  effective  is  an  Android-based  personal  financial  management  application  in  improving  the

financial habits of young adults in higher education?

2)  To  what  extent  can  regular  engagement  with  the  application  enhance  financial  literacy  and

contribute to long-term financial resilience among users?

3)  Which  features  most  effectively  promote  consistent  financial  management  behaviors,  such  as

budgeting, expense tracking, and goal setting?

Proactive and practical steps are necessary to prevent younger generations from falling into financial
difficulties.  A  foundational  strategy  for  improving  financial  literacy  is  consistently  recording  and
managing personal finances [14]. This practice helps individuals align their spending habits with their
needs,  plans,  and  goals.  Effective  personal  financial  management  hinges  on  strategically  allocating
income  across  expenses,  savings,  and  investments  [15].  Individuals  bear  responsibility  for  managing
their finances as a critical aspect of daily life, which can yield positive outcomes, particularly in curbing
excessive consumerism [16].

Moreover, financial management is a vital 21st-century skill, resting on four pillars: income, expenses,
savings, and planning. Healthy finances result from sustainable and deliberate money management [17].
To address this challenge, fostering financial habits requires tools that are both accessible and easy to

maintain. Research underscores that mobile phones—used frequently in daily life—are ideal platforms
for  cultivating  such  habits  [18],  [19],  [20].  By  leveraging  this  technology,  the  proposed  application
serves as a platform to reinforce consistent financial tracking and reflection.

This  research  addresses  a  critical  gap  by  targeting  younger  demographics  with  a  customized  digital
solution for personal finance management. The study contributes to advancing financial literacy as a
fundamental 21st-century competency through practical implementation and evaluation. By integrating
goal-setting  frameworks,  automated  reminders,  and  an  intuitive  interface,  the  application  offers  a
holistic  approach  to  nurturing  healthier  financial  habits  and  mitigating  financial  instability  among
Indonesia’s young adults.

systematic  progression

This  research  employed  the  Waterfall  model,  a  structured  software  development  methodology,  to
sequential  phases:  requirements  analysis,  design,
ensure
implementation, testing, and deployment [21], [22], [23]. This approach enabled organized execution
and thorough validation at each stage, minimizing iterative backtracking and ensuring alignment with
user needs [24], [25]. The methodology’s stages are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Phases of the waterfall model

The  Waterfall  model  was  chosen  for  its  linear,  phase-gated  structure,  which  ensured  systematic
validation of user requirements before advancing to design and coding. This minimized scope creep and
aligned with the study’s focus on replicable, structured development for academic evaluation.

2.1. Requirements Analysis

The initial phase focused on mapping user behaviors and needs through interviews and surveys targeting
young adults in higher education. The goal was to identify core financial management processes and
translate them into application features that promote engagement and financial literacy. Key processes
observed in user workflows are summarized in Table 1.

2.3. Implementation

The application was developed using Laravel (backend) and Flutter (frontend), ensuring secure data
handling  and  cross-platform  compatibility.  Laravel’s  MVC  architecture  facilitated  RESTful  API
development,  while  Flutter’s  widget-based  framework  enabled  a  responsive  UI  across  Android  and
iOS. Key modules were implemented as follows:

2.3.1. Login Module

The module securely manages user access to the application by providing fields for users to enter their
email  and  password,  with  data  encrypted  using  industry-standard  security  protocols  to  protect
credentials.  If  users  forget  their  password,  they  can  reset  it  through  a  secure  process  that  sends  a
verification code to their registered email. Additionally, the login process validates input formats, such
as correct email format and minimum password length, to ensure data integrity and enhance security.

Vol. 3, No. 1, February (2025), Pages 64–89 | e-ISSN: 2985–9166

2.3.3. Financial Goal Module

The financial goal module supports users in setting and tracking financial goals, such as saving for a
purchase  or  building  an  emergency  fund.  Users  can  define  specific  goals  with  target  amounts  and
deadlines,  and  the  application  tracks  progress  toward  these  goals  based  on  recorded  income  and
expenses.  This  module  includes  a  progress  bar  that  visually  represents  the  percentage  of  the  target
achieved, and users receive updates as they get closer to their goals. The module also includes a feature
that allows users to adjust goals, enabling them to modify target amounts or deadlines as their needs
change. Additionally, it provides personalized saving recommendations based on analyzing the user’s
financial data, suggesting realistic saving amounts to help users reach their goals on schedule.

2.3.4. Budget Projection Module

This  module  enables  users  to  set  and  monitor  monthly  budgets  across  various  categories,  such  as
“Housing,”  “Utilities,”  “Entertainment,”  and  “Savings.”  Users  can  input  specific  budget  amounts  for
each category and set durations to apply a budget across multiple months. The module compares user
expenditures with the set budget, providing visual indicators (e.g., color-coded progress bars) to show
users if they are within or exceeding their budget. If users exceed their budget, the system displays
alerts  encouraging  budget  adjustments.  The  budget  data  integrates  with  historical  financial  reports,
allowing users to compare current and past spending habits, which helps refine future budgets.

2.3.5. Notification Module

The notification module enhances user engagement by providing regular reminders to update financial
data and review goals. This flexible module allowed users to set notification preferences such as daily
or weekly reminders. Notifications encourage users to record their expenses, check their budgets, and
update  their  progress  on  financial  goals.  The  reminders  use  Android’s  built-in  notification  service,
ensuring they appear even when the application is closed, thus supporting consistent financial tracking
and habit formation. The application sends custom alerts to users when they are close to reaching a
financial goal or approaching a budget limit.

2.4. Testing

We  conducted  black-box  testing  to  evaluate  the  application’s  functionality  from  an  end-user
perspective,  ensuring  it  met  performance  standards without  inspecting  the  internal  code  [29],  [30].
This approach allowed us to test each feature for usability, reliability, and accurate functionality based
on expected outcomes. The testing procedure was structured to verify alignment with the application’s
requirements,  focusing  on  key  modules,  including  login,  income/expense  tracking,  goal  setting,
budget projection, financial reporting, and notifications.

Through  black-box  testing,  we  validated  the  application’s  robustness  using  scenarios  representing
typical  user  interactions.  This  approach  accurately  assessed  the  application’s  performance  and  user
experience, with detailed outcomes in the results section. As shown in Table 3, the testing covered
each primary module, focusing on specific aspects of functionality essential to providing a seamless user
experience.

2.5. Deployment

In  the  deployment  phase,  the  application  was  evaluated  directly  with  a  selected  group  of  end  users
representing  the  target  audience.  This  process  aimed  to  gather  preliminary  feedback  on  the
application’s functionality, usability, and user satisfaction before its official release. An evaluation was
conducted  in  a  beta  testing  format,  involving  users  who  matched  the  target  profile  (aged  19-34,
students or individuals requiring personal financial management).

2.5.1. Direct User Evaluation Process

We randomly selected 50 university students within the target age range  who met personal finance
management criteria. Each student received a detailed explanation of the research goals, participant
rights, and data privacy policies. Participation was voluntary, with an option to withdraw at any time.
After providing informed consent, students accessed the application and received brief training on key
features,  including  income  tracking,  goal  setting,  and  budget  projection.  Over  a  two-week  testing
period, participants used various Android devices commonly used by the target demographic, including
Samsung, Xiaomi, and Oppo models running Android 10 or later. At the end of the period, participants
completed  a  survey  about  their  experience.  All  data  collected  was  anonymized  and  used  solely  to
improve the application.

2.5.2. Evaluation Instrument

The evaluation instrument consisted of a survey based on a 1-5 Likert scale to measure users’ responses
to each evaluation aspect. This instrument covered the following evaluation aspects and indicators, as
shown in Table 4.

2.5.3. Data Analysis

We analyzed the data collected from the evaluation survey to identify the application’s strengths and
areas for improvement based on end-user feedback. The analysis centered on calculating average scores
for  each  evaluation  aspect,  which  were  then  categorized  to  provide  a  comprehensive  view  of  the
application’s performance across key dimensions. This approach allowed us to highlight specific areas
where  the  application  met  or  exceeded  expectations  and  pinpoint  aspects  that  could  benefit  from
targeted enhancements.

We recorded each user’s response on a 1-5 Likert scale for every indicator, and average scores were
calculated across all responses. This average score represented the application’s performance on each
specific  indicator  within  an  evaluation  aspect.  For  each  evaluation  aspect,  the  average  scores  of  all
indicators  were  then  summed  and  divided  by  the  number  of  indicators  to  obtain  an  aspect  score
(Equation  1).  This  score  provided  an  overall  measure  of  the  application’s  performance  within  each
aspect.

Vol. 3, No. 1, February (2025), Pages 64–89 | e-ISSN: 2985–9166

The overall application score was calculated by averaging the aspect scores from each evaluation aspect,
as  shown  in  Equation  2,  to  represent  the  application’s  general  performance  across  all  aspects.  This
overall application score provided a single value summarizing the application’s effectiveness and user
satisfaction.

4. DISCUSSION

This study developed and evaluated an Android-based personal finance management application to meet
young  adults’  financial  literacy  and  management  needs.  Through  a  focus  on  usability,  engagement,
functionality, and user satisfaction, the results indicate that the application successfully addresses many
financial management challenges young adults encounter. The findings also suggest potential areas for
refinement that could further enhance the application’s effectiveness in promoting responsible financial
habits.

The  study’s  first  objective  was  to  assess  how  effectively  the  application  improved  users’  financial
management behaviors. With over 90% of users rating it at (4) four or above on the Likert scale, the
high usability ratings indicate that the application’s design was intuitive and accessible, even for those
with  minimal  experience  in  financial  tracking.  Usability  is  critical  in  fostering  consistent  usage,  as
applications that are easy to navigate and visually appealing are more likely to be used regularly. The
positive user feedback on core features such as expense tracking and budget projections supports this,
suggesting that users found the application useful and practical for their daily financial activities.

Notably, features like income and expense tracking were highly rated in functionality and satisfaction,
underscoring their value in enhancing users’ awareness of their spending habits. Encouraging users to
categorize and analyze their expenses, the application promotes mindful spending, a behavior crucial
for long-term financial stability. However, while most users engaged consistently with these features,
some  desired  more  personalized  options,  such  as  customized  budget  categories  and  detailed
expenditure analysis. These suggestions align with prior studies indicating that personalized financial
tools can improve engagement by making users feel more connected to their financial data [31], [32].

The  second  research  question  focused  on  whether  regular  engagement  with  the  application  could
enhance  users’  financial  literacy  and  contribute  to  long-term  financial  resilience.  The  engagement
scores indicate that the application succeeded in motivating users to track their finances consistently,
with  a  significant  proportion  of  reporting  plans  to  continue  using  the  app.  This  regular  interaction

reinforces positive financial habits and increases financial literacy by exposing users to daily spending
and saving decisions.

The findings suggest that the application’s design elements, such as progress bars for financial goals and
notification  reminders,  were  important  in  maintaining  user  engagement.  This  aligns  with  behavior
change theory, which posits that timely reminders and visible progress indicators can reinforce positive
habits by making achievements tangible [33], [34]. Users specifically mentioned that the visual tracking
of financial goals motivated them to set and work toward achievable financial objectives, demonstrating
the application’s potential to foster a proactive approach to financial planning. While notifications were
generally well-received, some users expressed interest in more customizable reminder options, such
as  setting  personalized  alert  times.  Incorporating  such  feedback  could  enhance  user  engagement  by
providing a tailored experience that aligns with individual schedules, which has been shown to increase
the likelihood of habit formation in digital applications [35], [36], [37].

The  study  also  sought  to  identify  which  features  most  effectively  encouraged  consistent  financial
management behaviors. Based on user feedback, features such as income and expense tracking, budget
projections, and financial goal setting were the most impactful. These features align closely with the
primary  behaviors associated  with  financial  responsibility:  tracking,  planning, and  setting achievable
financial targets. In particular, the financial goal-setting feature was instrumental in helping users focus
on  saving  for  specific  objectives.  This  functionality  resonates  with  the  concept  of  “goal-oriented
behavior,”  which  research  indicates  can  lead  to  increased  motivation  and  better  long-term  financial
outcomes [38], [39]. By enabling users to break down their financial goals into manageable steps, the
application helps build confidence and competence in managing money, which are critical to financial
resilience.

However, some users noted that while the budget projection feature was helpful, it could be further
improved by allowing for more nuanced budget categories. Additionally, users suggested incorporating
a more comprehensive financial report that could offer  insights into spending trends over time. Such
enhancements  would provide  users with a  deeper  understanding  of  their  financial  patterns and help
them make more informed decisions, a need highlighted by various studies on digital finance tools [40],
[41], [42]. Integrating these improvements in future updates would likely enhance the application’s role
as  an  educational  tool  for  financial  literacy.  This  application’s  success  in  engaging  young  adults
underscores the broader potential for mobile solutions to influence financial behavior. Digital platforms
are  uniquely  positioned  to  reach  young  users  who  are  comfortable  with  technology  but  may  lack
financial literacy. By offering an accessible and engaging tool, the application supports the development
of financial skills essential for navigating complex economic environments.

The  findings  suggest  that,  beyond  practical  utility,  financial  applications  should  emphasize
personalization and adaptability to cater to individual financial needs and schedules. As young adults
transition through various life stages, their financial priorities shift; thus, applications that adapt to these
changes can sustain users’ financial journeys. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of user-
centered design in financial applications, as it significantly impacts engagement and satisfaction. Future
research could explore the longitudinal impact of consistent app use on financial literacy, particularly
concerning  debt  reduction,  savings  growth,  and  investment  behavior.  While  the  study  achieved  its
objectives, it is important to recognize certain limitations. The relatively short evaluation period may
not fully capture the application’s impact on long-term financial habits. Additionally, while the sample
was representative of the target demographic, a more extensive and diverse user base would provide a
broader perspective on user needs and preferences. Future studies could include longitudinal research
to assess the sustained impact of the application on financial literacy and behavior change.

Furthermore,  implementing  user  feedback  for  added  features,  such  as  trend  analysis  and  advanced
customization  options,  could  enhance  the  application’s  value.  Expanding  the  application’s  scope  to
include educational content on financial literacy topics may also increase its impact by providing users
with  practical  tools  and  theoretical  knowledge.  Given  the  rapid  evolution  of  financial  technology,
integrating  adaptive  AI  algorithms  to  offer  personalized  financial  advice  could  be  a  promising  future
direction.

5. CONCLUSION

This  study  successfully  developed  and  evaluated  an  Android-based  personal  finance  management
application specifically designed for young adults, focusing on usability, engagement, and functionality.
The application aimed to address its target audience’s specific financial management needs by providing
tools for tracking income and expense, budget projection, and setting financial goals. Through direct user
evaluations, the findings revealed high levels of user satisfaction across these core features, indicating that
the  application  effectively  supports  users  in  managing  their  finances  and  developing  positive  financial
habits.  Key  outcomes  showed  that  the  application’s  user-friendly  design,  interactive  features,  and
reminder notifications were essential in encouraging consistent engagement with financial management.
Features such as financial goal tracking and budget projection fostered mindful spending and motivated
users  to  set  and  work  toward  achievable  financial  goals,  an  essential  aspect  of  financial  responsibility.
Despite  these  successes,  feedback  suggested  room  for  improvement.  Users  expressed  interest  in
additional customization options, such as personalized budget categories and a more detailed analysis of
spending  trends.  Future  updates  could  also  incorporate  AI-driven  recommendations,  offering  users
personalized  financial  insights  based  on  spending  behavior,  further  enhancing  the  application's
functionality. Implementing these features could make the application even more responsive to individual
user  needs  and  preferences.  Overall,  the  application  demonstrates  significant  potential  to  enhance
financial  literacy  and  behavior  among  young  adults.  By  offering  an  accessible,  adaptable  platform  for
personal  finance  management,  this  application  contributes  significantly  to  efforts  toward  improving
financial resilience in the digital age. Future research could explore the long-term effects of regular app
usage on financial behavior, including savings growth, debt reduction, and investment practices.

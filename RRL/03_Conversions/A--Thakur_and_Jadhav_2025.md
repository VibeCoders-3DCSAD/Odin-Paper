MATERIALS AND METHODS

The  section  discusses  the  details  of  dataset  utilized  in
our  experiment,  along  with  different  machine  learning
models applied to predict expenses.

Dataset Description

The “Daily Household Transactions” [16] file contains
information  about  the  virtual  transactions  people  make
every  day.  This  information  includes  information  about
the  products  purchased,  the  price  used  for  each  product,
the date and time of each transaction, the payment for each
transaction,  and  the  location  of  each  document  (debit/
income). Data can be used to analyze purchasing behavior
and financial management, estimate expenses, and develop
savings  strategies  and  budgets.  This  data  is  ideal  for  data
analysis and machine learning and can be used to train pre-
dictive models and make decisions from the data. The data-
set attributes are as follows.

Machine Learning Models

Nowadays, machine learning has potential applications
which  continues  to  evolve  and  expand  into  new  various
areas  such  as  healthcare,  finance,  industry  etc.  By  lever-
aging vast amounts of data and advanced algorithms, ML
enables  smarter,  more  efficient,  and  innovative  solutions
across various fields [17].
•  Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): XGBoost is an
efficient version of the gradient boosting algorithm. It
creates  a  sequential  decision  tree,  where  each  subse-
quent  tree  corrects  the  mistakes  of  the  previous  ones.
Known for its efficiency and effectiveness. XGBoost is
widely  used  in  many  machine-learning  fields  such  as
classification, regression, and ranking. Each tree is built
using a random subset of features, and predictions from
individual trees are combined through voting or averag-
ing to make the final prediction.

•  Random  Forest  (RF):  is  an  ensemble  learning  method
that  combines  multiple  decision  trees  to  improve  the
predictive accuracy and robustness of a model. Random
forests  are  valuable  for  their  robustness  against  overfit-
ting and their suitability for classification and regression
problems. The hyperplane that best separates the classes.
•  SVM  (Support  Vector  Machine):  SVM,  which  allows
the separation of classes, is useful in large areas and in
cases  where  the  number  of  features  is  larger  than  the
sample. It finds application in classification and rework-
ing, especially in cases where classes are separated. Hide
and reveal layers.

•  Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): MLP is trained using a
regression model that adjusts the weights of neurons to
reduce the error between predictions and actual results.
MLP is known for its ability to learn nonlinear relation-
ships  and  is  often  used  in  tasks  such  as  classification,
regression, and pattern recognition.

•  K-Nearest  Neighbors  (KNN):  It  predicts  the  class  of
data  points  by  identifying  the  class  of  most  of  their
nearest neighbors (for classification) or by the average
value of its neighbor (for regression). The performance
of KNN depends on the distance measure choice and k
value. Each classification is determined by the value of
the selected item, creating a tree-like structure.

•  Decision Tree (DT): Decision trees are easy to interpret
and visualize and are useful for understanding the deci-
sion-making process. However, they are easy to overfit,

especially  for  complex  data  that  can  be  resolved  with
techniques such as pruning and integration.

•  Extra  Tree  (ET):  ET  is  an  ensemble  learning  method
that  aggregates  the  predictions  of  multiple  de-cor-
related decision trees collected in a “forest” to improve
the predictive accuracy and control overfitting. Unlike
Random  Forest,  which  selects  optimal  cut-points  for
splits, Extra Trees split nodes using random cut-points
for  each  feature,  which  introduces  more  randomness
into the model.

•  Categorical  Boosting  (CatBoost):  CatBoost  incorpo-
rates advanced techniques like ordered boosting, which
improves  training  speed  and  reduces  overfitting.  Its
strength  lies  in  its  robustness,  ease  of  use,  and  ability
to  deliver  high-quality  predictions  on  a  wide  range  of
datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Ensemble Learning Models

Ensemble  learning  [18,  19]  is  a  technique  in  machine
learning where we combine the predictions of several dif-
ferent models to make a stronger and more accurate model
than any individual model. By pooling together predictions
from diverse models, ensemble learning helps to reduce the
weaknesses  of  individual  models  while  maximizing  their
strengths, resulting in better overall performance [20].
•  Bagging:  Involves  training  multiple  instances  of  the
same  base  model  on  different  subsets  of  the  training
data and averaging their predictions.

•  Boosting: Builds a strong learner by sequentially train-
ing  multiple  weak  learners,  where  each  subsequent
learner  focuses  more  on  the  misclassified  instances
from the previous learners.

•  Stacking: Involves training multiple base models and then
using a meta-model to combine their predictions, treating
the predictions of base models as additional features.
•  Voting: Combines the predictions of multiple models by
aggregating their individual predictions using a simple
voting mechanism (e.g., majority vote for classification
or averaging for regression).

•  Blending: Blending is like stacking, but it uses a holdout
set (a part of the training set) to generate predictions for
the  training  set  of  the  meta-model.  This  can  be  more
robust  than  voting  or  a  single  layer  of  models  since  it
incorporates multiple stages of learning and validation.

PROPOSED WORK

The  section  discusses  the  proposed  work  in  terms  of
data  preparation  phase  and  regression  phase.  The  “Daily
Household  Transaction”  dataset  is  pre-processed  to  apply
machine  learning  models  for  training  and  predicting
expenses.  The  data  preprocessing  is  divided  into  multiple
steps;  the  first  step  is  normalization  using  MinMax  scal-
ing  technique  which  scales  each  feature  to  a  given  range,
between 0 and 1 [21]. This scaling is useful when you want
all features to be on a similar scale, which can improve the

Error, Mean Square Error and Relative absolute error. These
are  the  common  parameters  used  in  regression  analysis.
They  provide  different  perspectives  on  how  well  a  model
is performing.

R-squared (R2) value

Also  known  as  the  coefficient  of  determination,
R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the
dependent  variable  (target)  that  is  predictable  from  the
independent variables (features). Higher R-squared scores
(closer to 1) indicate better model fit.

where,  SSres  and  SStot  the  sum  of  the  squared  differences
between the observed values and the predicted values, and
the  sum  of  the  squared  differences  between  the  observed
values and the mean of the observed values respectively.

Mean absolute error (MAE)

This metric quantifies the average magnitude of errors
between  predicted  and  actual  values.  Lower  MAE  values
indicate better model performance.

(2)

where,  n  is  the  number  of  observations,  yi  is  the  actual
value, and ŷi is the predicted value.

Mean square error (MSE)

MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors
that  is,  the  average  squared  difference  between  the  actual
values and the predicted values.

(3)

where,  n  is  the  number  of  observations,  yi  is  the  actual
value, and ŷi is the predicted value.

Relative absolute error (RAE)

RAE measures the total absolute error as a proportion
of the total absolute error of a simple predictor, such as the
mean of the actual values. It provides a normalized measure
of prediction accuracy.

where, n is the number of observations, yi is the actual value,

ŷi is the predicted value, and
The R-square value provides an indication of how well
the model’s predictions match the actual data. MAE mea-
sures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predic-
tions.  Relative  absolute  error  is  particularly  useful  when

performance  of  many  machine  learning  algorithms.  In
second  step  is  transformation  of  amount  attribute  using
‘log1p’ function. The log1p function computes the natural
logarithm of ‘1 + x’, which is useful for transforming data
(amount in our case) that may contain zero or small posi-
tive values as shown in Figure 1.

Lastly, the third step in data preprocessing is vectorizer
process  using  ‘TfidfVectorizer  (min_df=3)’,  it  transforms
text data into numerical values based on the term frequen-
cy-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) statistic, param-
eter ‘min_df =3’ specifies that only terms (words or tokens;
in our case ‘Mode’, ‘Category’,’ Subcategory’, ‘Note’, ‘Income/
Expense’)  that  appear  in  at  least  three  documents  will  be
considered, reducing noise and dimensionality. By convert-
ing the text data into TF-IDF vectors, it transforms the text
into a numerical format that can be fed into algorithms.

After  successful  preprocessing,  the  dataset  is  divided
into the ratio of 70:30, where 70% is used for training and
30% is used for testing purposes. The next phase is regres-
sion phase, the training data and testing data is fed to mul-
tiple  machine  learning  models  and  predictions  are  made,
evaluated using two regression metrics; r-squared value and
mean absolute error.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  section  discusses  the  evaluation  parameters  used
in the experiment, along with a description, results of the
machine  learning  model.  The  section  also  showcases  the
web  application  description  and  screenshots  of  the  web
application for better understanding.

Evaluation Parameters

The results of the Expense Tracker Management System
are evaluated in terms of R-squared value, Mean Absolute

comparing different models. Mean square error is a pre-
ferred metric for optimizing and assessing model fitness,
also  offers  an  absolute  measure  of  predictive  accuracy.
The  performance  of  the  different  machine  learning  and
ensemble  models  is  evaluated  over  these  metrics  and  is
shown in Table 2.

The  results  in  Table  2  showcase  the  performance  of
individual machine learning models and ensemble learn-
ing  techniques.  The  parameter  tuning  process  for  the
selected  machine  learning  models  involves  identifying
key  hyperparameters  such  as  learning  rate  for  XGBoost
or number of neighbors for KNN, by using Hit and Trial
method.  The  models  are  evaluated  based  on  perfor-
mance  metrics  such  as  R-squared  and  Mean  Absolute
Error  through  cross-validation  to  prevent  overfitting.
The  best-performing  hyperparameters  are  selected  and
validated  on  a  test  set  to  ensure  that  improvements  are
generalizable to new data. The performance of XGBoost
technique  outperforms  other  individual  machine  learn-
ing  models  with  a  highest  r-square  value  of  77.89,  while
Voting Ensemble Regressor outperforms individual mod-
els and other ensemble approaches with highest r-square
value of 78.11 and lowest relative absolute error of 0.1765.
As  r-square  value  is  a  useful  metric  for  evaluating  the
explanatory power of a model, it does not always provide a
complete picture of model performance. Since there is no
more  difference  in  the  r-square  value  of  models  because
of characteristics of the dataset, as the distribution of the
variables and the nature of their relationships, explaining
the same amount of variance. RAE stands out be the decid-
ing factor in our approach as the RAE of voting ensemble
regressor is lowest.

Web Application Development

The  application  development  for  expense  tracking
involves  ensuring  seamless  user  experience  by  incorpo-
rating features such as income and expense limits, savings
tracking,  and  intuitive  interfaces.  The  effectiveness  of  the
reminder system is crucial for user engagement and adher-
ence to budgeting goals. A user-friendly design reduces the
learning curve, making the app accessible to diverse demo-
graphics. The framework behind the application develop-
ment is described below.

cation and its working in the form of description. User
authentication
involves  configuring  the
built-in authentication system, creating login views and
templates,  and  managing  user  sessions  using  functions
like `login()` and `logout()`. User authorization utilizes
Django’s permissions system, where permissions can be
defined at the model level and enforced using decorators
like `@login_required` to restrict access to views based
on authentication status. Customization can be done by
creating custom authentication backends or user models
to suit specific requirements, the login page is shown in
Figure 2.

Figure 2. Login page.

The  expense  tracker  management  system  provides  a
detailed expense summary that offers users a comprehen-
sive view of their financial activity. The summary includes
the total expenses for a selected period, along with a break-
down by categories such as food, transportation, and enter-
tainment,  visualized  through  pie  or  bar  charts  as  shown
in  Figure  3.  Monthly  spending  trends  are  depicted  using
line charts, highlighting patterns and significant variances.
Detailed transaction lists are available for review, showing
individual expenses with dates, amounts, and descriptions.

ity to view, update, and delete  existing expenses,  and fea-
tures like filtering and sorting to analyze spending patterns.
Users  can  categorize  expenses  for  more  detailed  tracking
and  apply  tags  for  specific  projects  or  events.  The  system
also provides tools to generate expense reports and visual-
ize spending trends over time.

The income entry feature in the expense tracker man-
agement system enables users to easily record and manage
their  earnings.  Users  can  input  details  such  as  the  date,
source,  amount,  and  mode  of  payment  for  each  income
entry,  ensuring  accurate  and  comprehensive  financial
records as shown in Figure 6. They can also add descrip-
tions and categorize their income to facilitate better track-
ing  and  analysis.  Additionally,  the  system  allows  users  to
mark  certain  income  entries  as  recurring,  automating
future  entries  and  saving  time.  Once  entered,  the  income
details are saved and displayed in the income summary and
transaction list, where users can view, edit, or delete entries
as  needed.  This  streamlined  process  helps  users  maintain

Expense categorization in the expense tracker manage-
ment system allows users to classify their expenses into pre-
defined categories for better organization and analysis. This
involves  creating  a  model  for  expense  categories,  which
typically includes fields like name, description, and possi-
bly a color or icon for visual distinction such as in Figure 7,
it indicates shopping, food, rent and other. Users can assign
categories  to  their  expenses  either  manually  or  through
automated rules. The system may provide features for man-
aging categories, such as adding, editing, or deleting them,
as well as reporting functionalities to track spending across
different categories over time.

Figure 8 depicts the search and filter capabilities in the
debt tracking system allow customers to effectively and effi-
ciently identify their debts based on specific criteria. This
includes using features that allow users to search for debt
using keywords or phrases, filter debt by attributes such as
date, category, price or description, and combine multiple

filters to narrow down. The system may provide user inter-
faces such as a search bar, drop-down menu, or date picker
to  facilitate  filter  selection.  Additionally,  advanced  filter
options such as sorting by relevance or custom filter presets
can improve user experience and productivity.

Application Benefits

Our  application  outperforms  other  applications  from
the  state-of-the-art  discussed  in  the  literature.  Here  are
some points which outstand our application.

cial advice are used as important tools to promote financial
literacy,  budgeting,  and  overall  health  for  individuals  and
organizations.

To conclude, various machine learning techniques and
ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, stacking, voting,
and  blending  are  employed  for  prediction.  Among  these,
XGBoost achieves R-squared value of 77.89%, the highest
compared  to  other  individual  models,  while  the  voting
ensemble regressor surpasses other ensemble methods with
the highest R-squared value of 78.11% and the lowest rela-
tive absolute error of 0.6121. The proposed approach helps
to forecast future expenses by analyzing users’ past spend-
ing  patterns  and  behaviors.  By  leveraging  historical  data,
these methods provide valuable insights into future finan-
cial needs and trends of any individual or business.

The

the  Expense  Tracker
Management System holds promise for even greater inno-
vation  and  impact.  Potential  enhancements  may  include
integration  with  emerging  technologies  such  as  advanced
artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning,  enabling  pre-
dictive  analytics  for  personalized  financial  insights  and
automated  expense  categorization.  We  aim  to  enhance

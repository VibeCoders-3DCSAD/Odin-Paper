ABSTRACT
Time Series Forecasting (TSF) involves predicting future values and trends of data at specific points
or periods by analyzing historical patterns, such as trends and seasonality. With the advent of IoT
sensors, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to handle massive time series datasets.
Recently, deep learning algorithms, exemplified by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent
neural networks (RNNs), and Transformer models, have made significant progress in time series
forecasting tasks. This paper reviews the common features of time series data, relevant datasets,
and evaluation metrics for models. It also conducts experimental comparisons of various forecasting
algorithms, focusing on time and algorithmic architectures. This paper conducts prediction
experiments on several deep learning models using the ETT dataset and presents the final results.

We evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared
Error (MSE). We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning-based TSF methods.
Major deep learning-based time series forecasting methods are introduced and compared. Finally,
challenges and future research directions in applying deep learning to time series forecasting are
discussed.

Keywords:  Deep learning; time series forecasting; recurrent neural networks; gated recurrent units;

3.2.1 Forget Gate

In an LSTM, the first step is determining which information should be filtered out from the cell state by
the forget gate. This operation is achieved through the forget gate's structure. The forget gate reads
the previous output h  and the current input x , applies a Sigmoid nonlinear transformation, and
|     |     |     | t−  | 1   |     |     | t   |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
outputs a vector ft . Each value in this vector ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates complete retention
and 0 indicates complete discard. This vector is then multiplied element-wise with the cell stateC
t-1
.For example, in a language model, the cell state may encode the gender information of the subject in
the current sentence, ensuring the correct pronoun is selected. When a new subject is identified, the
forget gate removes the prior subject's gender information to make room for the new information.

3.3 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

GRU is a simplified variant of LSTM that retains the gating mechanisms (update and reset gates) to
control the flow of information while omitting the separate memory cell. GRUs have fewer parameters
than  LSTMs,  resulting  in  higher  computational  efficiency  and,  in  some  cases,  similar  or  better
performance. The core components of GRU include:

3.4 Bi-LSTM Model
The Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory) network is an improved version of the
LSTM network. It combines two LSTMs: one
processes the sequence from the beginning to
the end, while the other processes it in reverse,
from the end to the beginning. This architecture
excels in several tasks compared to standard
LSTM networks. Bi-LSTM is a time-recurrent
neural network that stacks forward and backward
LSTM layers together. The output is determined
by the hidden states of these two LSTM layers.
Bi-LSTM combines the traditional forward and
backward time sequences, leveraging LSTM's
sensitivity to sequence order to construct a
bidirectional network. The concatenated vector of
outputs from the forward and backward
processes provides the complete hidden
representation of Bi-LSTM, as shown below:
(17)
Here, (1−z)h controls the retention of past
t t−1 ~
information, and z h introduces new
t t
information. This formula ensures that the current
hidden state incorporates both historical and new
information effectively.
h
t
= h ft  h bt (18)
Here, h ft is the output from the forward LSTM
layer, and h bt is the output from the backward
LSTM layer. These outputs are combined using
element-wise summation. The internal structure
of Bi-LSTM cells is identical to that of standard
LSTMs and is thus not elaborated further.

Firstly, extract the query vector (

Q ), key vector
( K ), and value vector ( V ) from the embedded
vector. Next, determine a score for each vector:
the score is equal toQ•K. Score normalization
(division d
k
) is used for gradient stability. Next,
use the softmax activation function to process
the scores. The weighted score of each input
vector is obtained by taking the softmax dot
product value. Sum up to produce the final result.
3.5.2 Multi-head attention mechanism
The Transformer model employs a multi-head
self-attention mechanism to enhance its ability to
capture dependencies among elements in a
sequence. The core principle of the attention
mechanism is that each token in a sequence can
aggregate information from other tokens,
enabling the model to better understand
contextual relationships. This is achieved by
mapping a query, a set of key-value pairs, and
an output (each represented as vectors) into an
attention function. The output is computed as a
weighted sum of the values, where the weights
are determined by a compatibility function
between the query and the corresponding keys.
Multi-head attention is equivalent to combining
multiple scaled dot-product attention
mechanisms. It effectively parallelizes the
processing of the query ( Q ), key (K ), and value
( V
Here,
) vectors, resulting in a final output that
integrates information from different attention
heads.
3.5.3 Positional encoding
Since the Transformer model does not rely on
recursion or convolution, it requires a method
to capture the relative or absolute position of
tokens within a sequence to effectively utilize
sequential order. Positional encoding is
introduced at the input level of the encoder and
decoder stacks. These positional encodings are
added to the input embeddings, sharing the
same dimensional space. They are calculated
using sine and cosine functions at different
frequencies as follows:
  t 

sin ,i =2k
 100002k/d 
PE(t) = (20)
i
  t  cos ,i =2k+1
  100002k/d 
t is the position in the sequence, d is the
vector dimension, and k is the natural number
used for indexing. By mapping each position to a
unique frequency using sine and cosine
functions, and converting the frequency into an
element in the embedding vector using the
corresponding sine and cosine functions, the
model can capture the position information when
processing the input sequence.
3.6 Comparison of Deep Learning Models
Datasets: This study conducted experiments
using the ETTm2, Electricity, Traffic, and
Weather datasets. Other datasets were excluded
due to insufficient periodicity, seasonality, or data
volume.
Experiment Details: To ensure consistency, all
models used an input sequence length of 24 and
a prediction length of 1. For the ETTm2,
Electricity, and Weather datasets, the first
variable was selected for prediction, representing
the high-useful load of an electric transformer oil
temperature, a user's hourly electricity
consumption, and atmospheric pressure,
respectively. For the Traffic dataset, the third
variable was selected, representing the hourly
road occupancy rate recorded by a sensor. All
models were trained using the Adam optimizer,
with MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean
Absolute Error) as evaluation metrics. PyTorch
was used for implementation.

models on the ETTm2 dataset, where the
horizontal axis represents the dataset, the
vertical axis represents the numerical size, the
blue curve represents the actual data value, and
the red curve represents the predicted value.

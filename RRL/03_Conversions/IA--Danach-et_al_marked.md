Abstract. The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for high-stakes decision-making
has heightened the need for systems that prioritize not only accuracy but also interpretability
and transparency. Although optimization techniques—such as metaheuristics, mathematical pro-
gramming, andreinforcementlearning—havesignificantlypropelledthedevelopmentofintelligent
systems, their inherent black-box characteristics often hinder trust, accountability, and effective
human-AI interaction. This article presents a comprehensive systematic review of the emerging
intersectionbetweenexplainableAI(XAI)andoptimization. Weexplorehowinterpretabilityisbe-
ingsystematicallyincorporatedintooptimization-drivendecision-makingpipelinesacrossavariety
of application domains. The study offers a critical analysis and classification of existing research,
focusing on the integration of XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME, saliency maps) with optimiza-
tion strategies (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, mixed-integer linear programming,
and reinforcement learning-based methods). These integrations are examined across sectors such
as healthcare, finance, logistics, and energy systems. A structured taxonomy is introduced to
categorize hybrid approaches according to their level of explainability, optimization complexity,
and domain specificity. In addition, the review highlights key challenges in the field, including
the trade-off between performance and interpretability, the absence of standardized benchmarks,
and issues related to model scalability. Finally, we outline promising research directions such as
the development of explainable hyper-heuristics, domain-adaptable interpretable solvers, and AI
frameworks aligned with regulatory standards. By synthesizing this evolving body of knowledge,
the article aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners striving to
build transparent, trustworthy, and effective optimization-based AI systems.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly embedded in decision-making pro-
cesses across a wide range of domains, including healthcare, finance, energy, and trans-
portation. In these contexts, decisions made by AI-driven models can have significant
ethical, economic, and social implications. However, many of the most effective AI sys-
tems—particularlythosebasedoncomplexoptimizationtechniquessuchasmetaheuristics,
reinforcement learning, and mathematical programming—function as black boxes, offer-
ing little to no insight into how or why a decision was made. This opacity undermines
trust, impedes regulatory compliance, and limits the adoption of AI in safety-critical and
ethically sensitive applications.
To address these limitations, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has
emerged, aiming to make AI decisions transparent, understandable, and accountable to
human stakeholders. At the same time, optimization remains a cornerstone of intelli-
gent decision-making systems, enabling the selection of optimal actions, schedules, routes,
and configurations under various constraints. Despite their complementary nature, the
integration of XAI techniques with optimization algorithms is still in its infancy, charac-
terizedbyscatteredstudies, domain-specificimplementations, andtheabsenceofaunified
framework. This systematic review bridges this gap by synthesizing the literature at the
intersection of XAI and optimization. We explore how interpretability and transparency
are being introduced into optimization-driven AI systems, assess the trade-offs between
performance and explainability, and classify existing approaches based on techniques, ap-
plications, and explainability goals. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we provide a struc-
tured taxonomy of XAI-integrated optimization methods; (2) we analyze domain-specific
applications and challenges; and (3) we highlight emerging research directions, including
explainable hyper-heuristics, interpretable solvers, and compliance-aware AI systems. As
AI becomes more pervasive, the ability to explain and justify optimization-based decisions
is no longer optional—it is essential. This article aims to serve as a foundational refer-
ence for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop transparent, trustworthy, and
high-performing intelligent systems.
While earlier surveys have mainly focused on explainable machine learning in isola-
tion ((1, 2)) or on narrow aspects of interpretable optimization such as feature-based
methods ((3)), they have not systematically addressed the integration of explainability
into optimization itself. This review advances the field by unifying XAI and optimization
into a comprehensive taxonomy that spans exact, heuristic, matheuristic, and learning-
to-optimize paradigms; by emphasizing strategies that embed interpretability by design
(e.g., certificates, constraint-based knowledge injection, bi-criteria formulations) rather
than relying solely on post-hoc explanations; and by providing sector-level mapping with
comparative insights into advantages, limitations, and open opportunities. To ensure
methodological rigor, this review followed systematic review principles. Literature was
retrieved from major scholarly databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore,
and ACM Digital Library, covering publications from 2010 through December 2024. The
search strategy employed Boolean operators and keywords such as (“Explainable Artifi-

cial Intelligence” OR “XAI”) AND (“optimization” OR “decision-making”) AND (“in-
terpretability” OR “transparency”). Inclusion criteria required that studies (i) explicitly
address the integration of explainability with optimization or decision-making systems,
(ii) provide methodological or application-level contributions, and (iii) be published in
peer-reviewed English-language venues. Exclusion criteria removed duplicates, non-peer-
reviewed works, and studies lacking methodological depth. The screening process pro-
ceeded in three stages: title/abstract filtering, full-text review, and final inclusion. Out of
642 identified records, 187 remained after screening, and 112 were ultimately included for
in-depth synthesis and taxonomy construction. This transparent protocol ensures repro-
ducibility and comprehensiveness.

the theoretical underpinnings and methodological advances in the domains of explainabil-
ityandoptimization. WebeginbyexaminingtheprinciplesandapproachesofExplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim to make complex models more interpretable and
accountable.
2.1. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to a suite of techniques, frameworks,
and principles designed to make the outputs of AI systems understandable to human
stakeholders. As AI increasingly influences decisions in domains such as healthcare, fi-
nance, law, and infrastructure, the need for transparency and interpretability has become
acentralconcern. Black-boxmodels, suchasdeepneuralnetworksandensemblemethods,
while highly accurate, often lack intuitive explanations for their predictions, posing risks
to trust, fairness, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
XAI approaches can be broadly categorized into three types: post-hoc explanations,
intrinsically interpretable models, and example-based methods. Post-hoc techniques such
as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations),andGrad-CAMprovidelocalorglobalinterpretabilitywithoutalteringthe
underlying model. Intrinsically interpretable models include decision trees, linear models,
andgeneralizedadditivemodels(GAMs),whichareinherentlyunderstandableduetotheir
structure. Example-based methods, including counterfactual explanations and case-based
reasoning, communicate decisions via reference to similar historical instances.
Several criteria are commonly used to evaluate XAI methods, including fidelity (the

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 4 of 28
degree to which the explanation reflects the original model’s behavior), comprehensibility
(how easily a human can understand the explanation), robustness, and fairness. Increas-
ingly, XAI is being guided by regulatory initiatives such as the EU Artificial Intelligence
ActandtheU.S.AIBillofRights,whichcallforalgorithmictransparencyandauditability.
Recent developments in XAI have extended its applicability to more complex sys-
tems, including multi-objective decision-making and deep reinforcement learning. How-
ever, many challenges remain, particularly in quantifying explanation quality, achieving
consistency across different explanations, and integrating interpretability as a core design
objective rather than a post-processing step. This motivates the integration of XAI into
broader intelligent systems, especially those driven by mathematical optimization.
Figure 1 summarizes the core landscape of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
presenting a structured taxonomy of key methodological categories, evaluation criteria,
regulatory influences, and real-world application domains. This diagram highlights how
differenttechniques—post-hocexplanations,intrinsicallyinterpretablemodels,andexample-
based methods—address the demand for transparent and trustworthy AI. It also empha-
sizes the practical importance of quantifying explanation quality and ensuring consistency
across methods, particularly as XAI is applied to complex, high-stakes systems. As the
reviewprogresses, wedelvedeeperintohowtheseXAIapproachesintersectwithoptimiza-
tion frameworks, enabling the development of intelligent systems that are both powerful
and interpretable.

niques (post-hoc, interpretable models, and example-based methods), evaluation criteria, regulatory context,

complex models.
2.2. Optimization in Intelligent Decision-Making
Optimization serves as the computational engine for artificial intelligence systems and
data-driven decision architectures, systematically navigating complex solution spaces to
identify Pareto-optimal outcomes under constraints. Modern approaches employ a strati-
fied methodology:
Exact methods such as branch-and-cut and branch-and-price algorithms extend the
classicalbranch-and-boundparadigmbyintegratingcuttingplanesandcolumngeneration,
respectively, enabling efficient solutions to large-scale mixed-integer programming and
combinatorial optimization problems ((4, 5)). Other notable exact approaches include
dynamic programming and constraint programming, which guarantee global optimality
under well-defined conditions ((6)).
Approximate methods are indispensable when problem size or complexity ren-
ders exact approaches computationally infeasible. Metaheuristics—including genetic algo-
rithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization—provide robust search capabil-
ities for NP-hard problems ((7, 8)). Hyperheuristics further generalize this paradigm by
automating the selection or generation of heuristics, enhancing adaptability across diverse
problem domains ((9–12)). Matheuristics combine metaheuristics with mathematical pro-
gramming components, leveraging the strengths of both to address complex real-world

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 6 of 28
problems ((13, 14)).
Learning-enhanced techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) are increas-
ingly integrated with optimization, enabling agents to adapt strategies in dynamic or un-
certain environments ((15)). Surrogate-based optimization employs predictive models to
approximate expensive objective functions, accelerating search in black-box or simulation-
driven contexts ((16)).
Despite these advances, traditional optimization approaches often prioritize solution
accuracy and efficiency at the expense of transparency. This is particularly problematic
in high-stakes applications like blockchain security, where interpretability, explainability,
and auditability are as critical as correctness ((17)).
Consequently, integrating explainable optimization has emerged as a vital research
frontier. Embedding interpretability directly into optimization models—for example, by
incorporating explainability constraints in metaheuristic fitness functions or designing RL
reward structures that promote transparency—supports human-in-the-loop collaboration,
regulatory compliance, and user trust. The fusion of optimization and explainable AI
is thus central to the following sections, especially in the context of secure, trustworthy
blockchain systems.
Figure 2 visually encapsulates the taxonomy and role of optimization in intelligent
systems, highlighting the spectrum of exact, approximate, and hybrid methods, as well as
their deployment across key application domains. While optimization remains essential
for producing efficient and high-quality decisions, the growing complexity and black-box
nature of many techniques have exposed critical gaps in interpretability. This underscores
the urgent need for integrating explainability directly into the optimization pipeline. By
doing so, decision-makers can not only achieve optimal outcomes but also understand and
justifythereasoningbehindthem—aprerequisitefortrust,compliance,andhuman-AIcol-
laboration in real-world deployments. The following sections delve into this convergence,
exploring how optimization and explainable AI can be harmonized to create transparent,
high-performance decision systems.

Figure 2: Overview of optimization methods in intelligent decision-making. The diagram categorizes opti-
mization techniques into exact, approximate, and hybrid approaches, highlights key application domains, and
underscores both the challenges (e.g., lack of transparency) and opportunities (e.g., integration with explain-
ability) associated with modern optimization systems.
Research at the intersection of decision-making, optimization, and explainable AI has
gained momentum in recent years. Early contributions focused on improving decision-
making in safety-critical domains, such as dangerous goods transportation, where fuzzy-
based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques were employed to manage risks
effectively ((18)). This line of research was later extended by integrating TOPSIS and
AHP methods with fuzzy sets to enhance transparency and reliability in dynamic routing

and transportation risk assessment ((19)). More recently, efforts have expanded beyond
transportation to include large-scale distributed computing environments. For instance,
an integrated MCDM framework has been proposed to achieve trust-aware and fairness-
awaretaskoffloadinginheterogeneousEdge–Fog–Cloudsystems,addressingthechallenges
of resource allocation and optimization in multi-provider environments ((20)). In paral-
lel, explainability and optimization have also been investigated in cybersecurity-sensitive
domains, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, where machine learning models
wereevaluatedfortheirabilitytodetectcyberattackswhileensuringreliableandtranspar-
ent decision-making ((21)). Together, these studies highlight the diversity of application
domains where optimization-driven decision-making is increasingly combined with inter-
pretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.
2.3. Bibliometric Overview
To complement the conceptual frameworks, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of
the corpus retrieved for this review (2010–2024). Figure 3 presents the annual publi-
cation trend, highlighting steady growth after 2017 and a sharp increase between 2020
and 2024, reflecting the surge in interest in combining explainability with optimization
in decision-making systems. Figure 4 shows the most frequent keywords extracted from

3. Convergence of Explainability and Optimization
As intelligent systems become more deeply embedded in decision-critical domains, the
interplay between optimization and explainability has emerged as a key research frontier.
Traditional optimization techniques, while powerful, often overlook the interpretability of
their outcomes—a limitation that can hinder trust and adoption in sensitive applications.
This section examines how explainability is systematically integrated into optimization
frameworks, reshaping how solutions are derived, assessed, and communicated.
3.1. Integrating Explainability into Optimization Frameworks
The convergence of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and mathematical opti-
mization represents a transformative paradigm in intelligent decision-making systems. In
this paradigm, the traditional pursuit of optimal solutions is augmented with the imper-
ative for interpretability and transparency ((1, 2)). Recent research increasingly treats
explainability as a primary design criterion rather than a post-hoc add-on, fundamentally
influencing how optimization problems are modeled and solved ((22)).
The field has evolved from simple visualization techniques to sophisticated frameworks
that embed interpretability constraints directly into mathematical programming models.
This shift has created a new class of multi-objective optimization problems where solution
quality is balanced against explanatory power ((23, 24)).
Recent developments demonstrate that explainable optimization can maintain near-
optimal performance while providing actionable insights into decision processes. These
advances address critical trust and accountability requirements in high-stakes applications
such as healthcare ((1, 25)), finance ((26)), and autonomous systems ((17)).

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 10 of 28
For example, integrating interpretability constraints into optimization models has
shown promise in clinical decision support systems, where explanations improve stake-
holder trust ((25)). Similarly, in financial portfolio optimization, explainability enhances
transparency and regulatory compliance ((26)). Collectively, these advances emphasize
the need to embed interpretability directly within optimization pipelines to satisfy the
requirements of real-world, high-stakes environments.
3.2. Theoretical Foundations of Explainable Optimization
The theoretical underpinnings of XAI in optimization rest on the principle that mod-
els should not only produce optimal solutions but also provide comprehensible justifica-
tions for their recommendations. This reframes optimization from a purely computational
exercise into a communicative process between algorithms and human decision-makers
((27, 28)).
Integrating explainability into optimization requires rethinking what constitutes a
“good” solution. Beyond mathematical optimality, solutions must include characteristics
that can be understood and trusted by human stakeholders ((29, 30)).
Learning to optimize (L2O) approaches represent a significant advancement in this di-
rection. They provide concrete tools for explainable AI by encoding both prior knowledge
and data-driven insights through optimization processes ((29)). These methods use two
key concepts: optimization as a means of encoding knowledge and certificates as mecha-
nisms for verification and explanation. When model outputs diverge from measurements
or expert expectations, certificate-based diagnostics help identify the source of error, con-
verting opaque pipelines into transparent and debuggable systems ((27, 29)).
The mathematical formulation of explainable optimization typically involves extend-
ing standard optimization models with additional terms that explicitly model solution
interpretability. This creates a bi-criteria optimization problem where optimality and in-
terpretabilityaretreatedasparallelobjectivesratherthancompetingconcerns. ((28,30)).
Suchformulationsallowdecision-makerstotunethetrade-offbetweenpureoptimalityand
explanation quality, ensuring that interpretability is achieved by design rather than ap-
proximated after the fact ((27, 30)).
3.3. Optimization-Based Knowledge Encoding
The encoding of prior knowledge through optimization represents a fundamental de-
parture from traditional machine learning approaches that rely primarily on data-driven
learning ((29)). In explainable optimization systems, domain expertise and regulatory
constraints can be directly incorporated into the mathematical model structure through
constraint-based knowledge injection. This creates solutions that are inherently aligned
with human understanding and expectations ((30)).
Suchconstraintsensurethatgeneratedsolutionsrespectphysicallaws(e.g., thermody-
namic restrictions in energy systems), business rules (e.g., regulatory capital requirements
in finance), or ethical thresholds (e.g., fairness in resource allocation). These serve as a
natural foundation for explanation generation and verification ((27)).

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 11 of 28
Certificate-based verification mechanisms, as formalized in ((29)), serve as the bridge
between optimization outcomes and human interpretation through three key components:
(i) Feasibility certificates: Mathematical proofs that solutions satisfy hard con-
straints.
(ii) Optimality gap certificates: Bounds on solution quality relative to theoretical
optima.
(iii) Stability certificates: Sensitivity analyses quantifying solution robustness.
When an optimization model produces a solution, these certificates provide formal
guarantees about its properties through verifiable computation protocols ((28)). For in-
stance, in portfolio optimization, a certificate might prove that recommended allocations
maintain diversification thresholds while achieving 95% of maximum theoretical returns.
When certificates do not hold, diagnostic codes map failures to specific components or
assumptions, enablingfocusedremediationandpreservinganauditabletrailevenforcom-
plex non-convex problems ((27, 29)).
Here’s a **draft related work paragraph** that integrates your citations naturally into
the context of explainable AI (XAI), optimization, and decision-making systems:
Several studies have investigated intelligent decision-making systems across diverse
domains, highlighting the growing demand for models that balance performance with in-
terpretability. For example, optimization and machine learning frameworks have been
applied in networking and cloud systems to improve resource allocation and adaptability,
yet often remain limited by their black-box characteristics ((31–33)). Similarly, decision-
support techniques leveraging multi-criteria decision-making and agent-based modeling
have been proposed for risk-aware and trust-oriented applications in logistics and edge-
fog-cloud computing, demonstrating the potential of transparent frameworks for critical
operations ((34–36)). In crisis management contexts, optimization-driven location plan-
ning for UAV-based communication services has been introduced, further emphasizing the
importance of interpretable models in safety-critical environments ((37)). Moreover, ex-
plainable methods have gained traction in socially impactful domains, such as fake news
detectionandhealthcare,whereinterpretabilityisvitalforfosteringtrustamongusersand
stakeholders ((38, 39)). At the methodological level, advanced mathematical and spectral
techniques have contributed to the modeling of complex systems, enriching the founda-
tion for integrating explainability into optimization pipelines ((40)). Collectively, these
works demonstrate significant progress in intelligent optimization and decision-making,
while underscoring the urgent need for systematic integration of explainability into such
systems to enhance transparency, trust, and usability.
3.4. Data-Driven Explainability Frameworks in Mathematical Optimiza-
tion
Modern data-driven explainability frameworks leverage historical instance–solution
pairs through similarity-preserving embedding spaces ((30)). These approaches recognize

where w j = sim(c,c j ) quantifies contextual similarity to historical instances. This for-
mulation enables explanation-by-precedent, where solutions inherit interpretability from

| of  | performance |     | and explanation |     | quality | ((28)). |     |     |
| --- | ----------- | --- | --------------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- |
The framework’s explanatory power stems from its dual attention mechanism:
•
Feature-level similarity: Matches problem characteristics using domain-specific
|     | metrics | (e.g., | patient | similarity |     | indices | in healthcare | scheduling). |
| --- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | --- | ------- | ------------- | ------------ |

|     | plates | through | regularized |     | optimization. |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
As demonstrated in supply chain optimization case studies ((30)), this approach re-
duces explanation generation time by 72% compared to post-hoc methods while maintain-
| ing | 98% solution |     | optimality. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The framework also extends to dynamic environments through explanation-aware re-
optimization:
|     |     |     |     | x∗  |          | (cid:2) (x)+γ∥x−x∗∥2(cid:3) |     |     |

where the regularization term γ∥x−x∗∥2 ensures explanation continuity across temporal
t
decision points ((29)). This temporal smoothing mitigates “explanation jitter,” in which
small input changes produce markedly different yet equally optimal solutions—a practical

4. Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications
Building on the conceptual integration of explainability and optimization, this sec-
tion delves into the algorithmic and architectural foundations that enable scalable and
interpretable intelligent systems. We focus on the computational effects of embedding
interpretability into optimization pipelines and present strategies that mitigate complex-
ity while preserving solution quality. The discussion begins with tractability considera-
tions, followed by methods that balance expressiveness with efficiency, and concludes with
application-oriented techniques.
4.1. Complexity and Design Strategies
4.1.1. Computational Complexity Considerations
The integration of explainability constraints into optimization models raises important
questions about computational tractability. It is well established that many straight-
forward explainable optimization formulations are NP-hard, significantly increasing the
computational burden compared to their traditional counterparts ((28, 29)). This occurs
because explainability constraints frequently introduce combinatorial restrictions that re-
duce the feasible solution space or require additional verification steps.
Despite this, tractability can often be preserved under specific problem structures. For
example, in polynomial optimization problems where features are modeled as structured
subsets, explainability constraints can be embedded without losing polynomial solvabil-
ity ((30)). A notable case is the explainable shortest path problem, where feature sets
are defined over edge subsets, allowing efficient solution despite added interpretability
requirements ((29)).
Computationalexperimentsonbothsyntheticandreal-worlddatasetsindicatethaten-
forcingexplainablepathconstraintstypicallyincreasessolutioncostbyonlyasmallmargin
((28)). These findings suggest that the trade-off between optimality and interpretability
can be favorable in practice. This challenges the common perception that interpretability
inevitably entails performance loss, and demonstrates that real-world deployments can
achieve both.
Such results motivate algorithmic strategies that exploit problem structure, such as
decomposition methods and approximation algorithms, which enable explainable opti-
mization to scale efficiently. They also highlight the importance of designing feature
representations that are expressive enough for interpretability while remaining computa-
tionally feasible.
4.1.2. Computational Complexity and Performance Trade-offs
Beyondtractability,acriticalissueishowexplainabilityconstraintsreshapecomputational
complexityandsolutionperformance. Inpractice,deploymentsmustoftenmeetstricttime
and resource budgets, making these trade-offs highly relevant.

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 14 of 28
Research indicates that the impact of explainability constraints varies significantly
acrossproblemclasses. Forsome,suchasshortestpathproblemswithedge-basedfeatures,
polynomial solvability is preserved ((29)). For others, more general requirements lead to
NP-hard formulations that require heuristics or approximation methods ((28)).
Interestingly, empirical studies reveal that explainability can sometimes enhance solu-
tion quality. By embedding domain knowledge or historical decision patterns into opti-
mization, constraints act not only as interpretability mechanisms but also as regularizers
that improve robustness ((27)). This indicates that explainability and optimality can be
complementary rather than competitive, especially when algorithms are combined with
human expertise ((29)).
4.1.3. Algorithmic Design for Explainable Optimization
While complexity analyses establish the theoretical burden, algorithmic design determines
how explainable optimization performs in practice. Designing algorithms for this setting
requires balancing computational efficiency with explanation quality. Traditional opti-
mization algorithms focus on convergence and accuracy, but explainable algorithms must
also ensure that solutions are interpretable by humans.
This requirement often entails modifying standard algorithms to include explanation-
oriented heuristics or maintaining auxiliary data structures that support post-solution
analysis. Forinstance,branch-and-boundalgorithmsmustbalancetheexploration–exploitation
trade-off while ensuring interpretability in the resulting solution paths. Branching strate-
gies can prioritize decision variables or constraints with clearer semantic meaning, while
bounding procedures must account for interpretability metrics in addition to solution
quality estimates.
Branch-and-bound (B&B) is a widely used exact optimization algorithm that explores
solution spaces by partitioning them into subproblems (branching) and pruning inferior
regions with bounds ((41–43)). Variants differ in node selection, such as best-first or
depth-first search, to balance convergence speed and memory usage ((44)). In explainable
optimization, B&B can be adapted by integrating explanation metrics into both bounding
and branching rules. Although this may increase computational overhead, it ensures that
solutionsarenotonlyoptimalbutalsoaccompaniedbymeaningful,human-understandable
rationales ((41, 43)).
4.2. Interpretable Optimization Techniques
4.2.1. Feature-Based and Rule-Based Interpretable Optimization Methods
Feature-based interpretable optimization extends beyond decision trees by employing gen-
eral optimization rules that provide flexibility while remaining interpretable ((3)). Unlike
decision trees that map instances to fixed solutions, feature-based methods associate in-
stances with sets of solutions sharing interpretable characteristics. This acknowledges
that multiple near-optimal solutions often exist, and interpretability can guide the choice
among them without compromising performance.

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 15 of 28
Optimization rules operate at a higher level of abstraction, identifying solution pat-
terns or characteristics rather than prescribing explicit assignments. This allows decision-
makerstocombinedomainknowledge, regulatoryrequirements, orstakeholderpreferences
with algorithmic efficiency. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides exact methods to
derive globally optimal rules, but scalability often necessitates heuristic approaches ((3)).
Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that feature-based interpretable surro-
gates can improve both solution quality and comprehensibility. By focusing on meta-
solutions—families of solutions sharing common features—the framework makes explana-
tions simpler and fosters trust among users.
4.2.2. Rule Generation and Validation
The generation of interpretable optimization rules involves analyzing historical solution
patterns to identify recurring features linked with strong outcomes. Machine learning
methods such as pattern mining and supervised learning are commonly used, but the
process must remain transparent and verifiable to satisfy interpretability goals ((3, 29)).
Validation requires proving that rules improve interpretability without compromis-
ing solution quality. Empirical evidence shows that feature-based interpretable optimiza-
tion often outperforms existing approaches in both robustness and interpretability ((3)).
These results nuance the presumed trade-off between interpretability and performance,
suggesting that carefully designed constraints can yield solutions that are both easier to
understand and more reliable.
Toensurereliability,validationprotocolsmustgobeyondaccuracyandassesspractical
usability and expert comprehensibility. Combining quantitative performance metrics with
expert evaluation accelerates trust and adoption in high-stakes applications ((29)).
As shown in Table 1, rule-based and certificate-based approaches excel in fidelity but
often face scalability and computational challenges, while AutoXAI offers adaptability
but may sacrifice consistency of explanations. These trade-offs illustrate the diversity of
design choices in explainable optimization and underscore the need for hybrid solutions
that balance performance, interpretability, and feasibility.

The growing diversity of explainable AI methods creates a new challenge: selecting the
most appropriate technique for each context. Automated XAI (AutoXAI) frameworks
address this challenge by automating the selection and tuning of explanation methods
usingevaluationmetricsanduserconstraints((45,46)). Thisensuresthatexplanationsare
not only technically valid but also operationally practical within organizational workflows.
AutoXAI builds on principles from recommender systems and AutoML, considering
datasetproperties, modelcharacteristics, explanationrequirements, andperformancecon-
straints. Candidate explainers are evaluated against multiple criteria, including:
•
| Fidelity    | –   | accuracy    | in reflecting | model   | behavior, |     |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- | ------------- | ------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 17 of 28
Framing these metrics as competing objectives allows principled, data-driven selection of
| explainers | tailored    | to real-world |              | optimization | pipelines ((45)). |

| 4.3.2.     | Integration | with          | Optimization |              | Workflows         |
The integration of AutoXAI into optimization workflows must respect real-time con-
straints, as many decision systems operate under strict deadlines. This requires ex-
planation methods that are computationally efficient without sacrificing interpretability
((45, 47)).
In optimization contexts, explanations must justify resource allocations, constraint
trade-offs, or sensitivity to parameters, rather than simply describing feature importance.
AutoXAI frameworks must therefore recognize these domain-specific requirements and
| select methods |     | accordingly | ((45, | 48)). |     |
| -------------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | ----- | --- |
Workflow orchestration tools further support seamless integration, coordinating data
flows, optimization steps, and explanation generation ((47)). This alignment of orchestra-
tion, time constraints, and domain-tailored explainability enables real-time, transparent
| decision-making |     | without | disrupting | operational | efficiency. |

4.4.1. Interpretable Clustering and Unsupervised Learning Integration
Clustering plays an important role in optimization by enabling problem decomposition,
exploratory analysis, and recognition of solution patterns. The challenge lies in creating
clustering methods that not only identify patterns but also explain how clusters form and
why items belong to them. This is especially important in domains like healthcare and
| logistics, | where | interpretability | is essential | ((49)). |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------- |
Interpretable in-clustering methods embed explainability within the clustering process
itself,typicallyformulatingitasamulti-objectiveoptimizationproblemthatbalancesclus-

| 4.4.2. Multi-Objective |          |        | Clustering | Optimization          |
Formulating clustering as a multi-objective optimization problem introduces unique chal-
lenges. Traditional clustering focuses on compactness or separation, while interpretable

The resulting Pareto frontier represents trade-offs between clustering quality and inter-
| pretability, | giving | practitioners | a spectrum | of viable solutions. |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
Simple interpretability metrics preserve polynomial complexity, but more sophisti-
cated requirements, such as rule-based cluster descriptions, often result in NP-hard prob-
lems ((49)). Specialized algorithms, including heuristics and approximation methods, are

As explainable optimization continues to mature, its influence is increasingly evident
across a range of high-impact sectors. Practical deployment highlights not only the value
of interpretability but also the diverse ways in which it can be operationalized to meet
real-world constraints and expectations. This subsection surveys emerging use cases and
domain-specific implementations, emphasizing how the integration of explainability en-
hances decision accountability and fosters broader adoption in critical industries.
| 5.1. Applications |     | and | Emerging |     | Use Cases |     |     |     |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | -------- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
The practical application of explainable optimization spans numerous domains where
decision transparency is crucial for stakeholder acceptance, regulatory compliance, or
risk management. Healthcare resource allocation represents a prominent application area
where optimization models must not only minimize costs or maximize efficiency but also
provide clear justifications for resource distribution decisions. Medical professionals re-
quire understanding of why certain allocation choices were made, particularly when these

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 21 of 28
decisions affect patient care quality or access to treatments ((51–53)).
Financial portfolio optimization exemplifies another critical application domain where
explainability requirements have driven significant methodological innovations. Invest-
ment decisions generated through optimization models must be explainable to regulators,
clients, and risk management teams. The complexity of financial markets and the high
stakes involved in investment decisions necessitate optimization approaches that can pro-
videclearrationalesforassetallocationchoices,riskexposurelevels,andtradingstrategies
((29)).
SupplychainoptimizationpresentsuniquechallengesforexplainableAIintegrationdue
to the multi-stakeholder nature of supply chain decisions and the need for coordination
acrossorganizationalboundaries. Optimizationmodelsthatrecommendsupplierselection,
inventory levels, or distribution strategies must provide explanations comprehensible to
diverse stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds. The explanations must address
not only the mathematical optimality of decisions but also their alignment with business
objectives, risk tolerance, and market conditions ((27)).
Table 3 summarizes how different application domains have applied XAI–optimization
techniques, outlining their advantages, limitations, and promising research opportunities.
5.2. Sector-Specific Implementation Challenges
The implementation of explainable optimization in different sectors reveals domain-
specific challenges that require tailored solution approaches. In healthcare, for instance,
explainability requirements are shaped by medical ethics, patient safety considerations,
and clinical decision-making processes. The explanations must be meaningful to medi-
cal professionals who may have limited optimization expertise but possess deep domain
knowledge about patient care and treatment protocols ((51, 52)).
In financial services, regulatory requirements such as the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and algorithmic accountability legislation create specific explainabil-
itymandatesthatoptimizationsystemsmustsatisfy. Theserequirementsoftenspecifythe
level of detail, accessibility, and format of explanations, constraining the design choices
available to optimization practitioners. The explanations must be sufficiently detailed to
satisfy regulatory scrutiny while remaining comprehensible to non-technical stakeholders
such as customers or auditors ((29)).
Addressing these sector-specific challenges requires integrating domain expertise with
technical innovation, ensuring that explainable optimization methods are both legally
compliantandpracticallyuseful. Thisofteninvolvesinterdisciplinarycollaborationamong
data scientists, domain experts, legal advisors, and end-users to co-design explanation
frameworks that meet diverse stakeholder needs ((27)).
5.3. Current Limitations and Research Gaps

tions continue to constrain the practical deployment of these approaches. The scalability

of explainable optimization methods to large-scale industrial problems remains a signifi-
cant challenge, as the computational overhead of generating and maintaining explanations
can become prohibitive for problems with thousands or millions of variables. Current re-
search has primarily focused on demonstrating feasibility through small to medium-scale
examples, leaving questions about industrial applicability largely unresolved ((3, 29)).
The standardization of explainability metrics and evaluation frameworks represents
another critical gap in the current research landscape. Unlike traditional optimization
where solution quality can be measured through objective function values, explainabil-
ity assessment requires subjective human evaluation that is difficult to standardize and
automate. This limitation hampers the systematic comparison of different explainable
optimization approaches and impedes the development of robust benchmarking method-
ologies ((27, 46)).
Theintegrationofexplainableoptimizationwithexistingenterprisesystemsanddecision-

tion. Most current approaches assume idealized environments where explainability re-
quirements can be clearly specified and consistently applied. In practice, organizations
often face conflicting interpretability needs across different stakeholders, regulatory re-

Future research in explainable optimization should prioritize the development of scal-
ablealgorithmicapproachesthatcanhandleindustrial-scaleproblemswithoutcompromis-
ingexplanationquality. Thischallengerequiresfundamentaladvancesinalgorithmdesign,
potentially drawing inspiration from parallel computing, approximation algorithms, and
machine learning acceleration techniques. The development of hierarchical explanation
frameworks that provide different levels of detail for different stakeholders represents a
promising direction for addressing scalability while maintaining interpretability ((3, 29)).
The creation of standardized evaluation frameworks for explainable optimization rep-
resentsanothercriticalresearchpriority. Theseframeworksshouldincorporatebothquan-
titative metrics for solution quality and systematic approaches for assessing explanation
effectiveness across diverse user populations. The development of automated explana-
tion evaluation techniques, possibly using natural language processing or computer vision

K. Danach et al. / Eur. J. Pure Appl. Math, 18 (4) (2025), 6707 24 of 28
methods, could enable large-scale empirical studies that are currently infeasible due to the
manual effort required for explanation assessment ((27, 46)).
The intersection of explainable optimization with emerging technologies such as quan-
tum computing, edge computing, and augmented reality presents exciting opportunities
for advancing the field. Quantum optimization algorithms may enable the solution of
previously intractable explainable optimization problems by leveraging quantum superpo-
sition and entanglement to explore solution spaces more efficiently. However, the inher-
entlyprobabilisticnatureofquantumcomputationraisesnewquestionsaboutexplanation
generation and validation in quantum optimization contexts ((54)).
Edge computing environments impose severe computational and memory constraints
that require fundamentally different approaches to explainable optimization. Traditional
explanation generation methods that rely on comprehensive historical data analysis or
complex visualization techniques may be infeasible in edge deployments. Research is
needed to develop lightweight explanation methods that can operate within the resource
constraints of edge devices while providing meaningful interpretability for local decision-
making processes ((55)).
Augmented reality (AR) and immersive visualization technologies offer new possibili-
ties for presenting optimization explanations in intuitive, interactive formats. These tech-
nologies could enable stakeholders to explore optimization solutions through spatial ma-
nipulation, temporal visualization, or multi-dimensional data representation techniques
that are impossible with traditional interfaces. The development of AR-based explanation
systems requires interdisciplinary collaboration between optimization researchers, human-
computer interaction specialists, and cognitive scientists ((56)).
6. Conclusion and Future work
This systematic review examined the intersection of explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) and optimization, with a focus on interpretable models for intelligent decision-
making systems. We presented a comprehensive taxonomy of XAI methods—including
post-hocexplanations,intrinsicallyinterpretablemodels,andexample-basedtechniques—and
explored how these approaches can be embedded into optimization workflows to enhance
transparency, accountability, and stakeholder trust.
We discussed the evolution of optimization paradigms from traditional exact and ap-
proximate methods to learning-based and hybrid approaches, emphasizing the growing
importance of interpretability as a design criterion rather than an afterthought. Special
attention was given to emerging frameworks such as AutoXAI, multi-objective clustering
optimization, and explainable hyper-heuristics, all of which demonstrate the feasibility
and necessity of integrating interpretability into complex optimization pipelines. Through
detaileddiagramsandworkflowillustrations, wehighlightedhow explainable optimization
enables human-in-the-loop collaboration, regulatory compliance, and more informed deci-
sions across domains such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and policy-making. However,
key research gaps remain—particularly in the areas of scalability, standardized evaluation
metrics, and enterprise integration.

Futureresearchshouldfocusondevelopingunifiedbenchmarksforexplainabilityinop-
timization, creating domain-specific AutoXAI libraries, and establishing interdisciplinary
frameworks that combine interpretability, robustness, and ethical compliance. Bridging
the gap between AI performance and human comprehension will be central to the next
generation of intelligent systems.

Financial behaviour is deeply embedded in our lives, yet for many people its success remains
problematic. The need for supporting tools in this space is reflected in the growing number and
popularity of budgeting apps, albeit limited research has focused on evaluating them. This paper
describes a functionality review from the lens of mental accounting theory of 45 top-rated budgeting
apps selected from 1335 apps on Google Play Store and Apple Store. Findings indicate that while all
apps support tracking of transactions, one third of the apps do not support budgeting informed by
money envelopes. We also report challenges regarding the meaning of key concepts of “accounts”
and “transactions” for which we proposed novel design implications including a more nuanced
vocabulary to talk about accounts and transaction types, new knowledge to have better support for
budgeting through mental accounting theory and grounding budgeting as cognitive process in
actual financial behaviour.

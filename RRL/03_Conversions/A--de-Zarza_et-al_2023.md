Abstract: In today’s complex economic environment, individuals and households alike grapple with
the challenge of financial planning. This paper introduces novel methodologies for both individual
and cooperative (household) financial budgeting. We firstly propose an optimization framework
for individual budget allocation, aiming to maximize savings by efficiently distributing monthly
income among various expense categories. We then extend this model to households, wherein the
complexity of handling multiple incomes and shared expenses is addressed. The cooperative model
prioritizes not only maximized savings but also the preferences and needs of each member, fostering
a harmonious financial environment, whether they are short-term needs or long-term aspirations.
A notable innovation in our approach is the integration of recommendations from a large language
model (LLM). Given its vast training data and potent inferential capabilities, the LLM provides
initial feasible solutions to our optimization problems, acting as a guiding beacon for individuals
and households unfamiliar with the nuances of financial planning. Our preliminary results indicate
that the LLM-recommended solutions result in budget plans that are both economically sound,
meaning that they are consistent with established financial management principles and promote
fiscal resilience and stability, and aligned with the financial goals and preferences of the concerned
parties. This integration of AI-driven recommendations with econometric models, as an instantiation
of an extended coevolutionary (EC) theory, paves the way for a new era in financial planning, making
it more accessible and effective for a wider audience, as we propose an example of a new theory in
economics where human behavior can be greatly influenced by AI agents.

1. Introduction

Financial planning [1,2] is an indispensable part of modern life. Whether it is an
individual planning their monthly expenses or a family juggling with combined finances,
effective budgeting is crucial for achieving long-term financial security and prosperity.
However, with the proliferation of expenses and the intricate nature of contemporary
economic systems, the endeavor of financial planning often feels overwhelming to many.
Traditional methods, while systematic, sometimes fall short in accommodating the dynamic
nature of financial needs, and often lack the ability to personalize recommendations to
cater to individual or household-specific priorities.

We are now entering the age of artificial intelligence (AI) [3], a transformative force
that has already revolutionized numerous sectors, from healthcare to entertainment. The
vast inferential and predictive capabilities of AI, especially models like the large language

model (LLM) [4], offer a unique advantage in the realm of financial planning. By pro-
cessing vast amounts of financial data and patterns [5], such models can provide tailored
recommendations that not only adhere to general financial best practices, which are widely
accepted principles or guidelines in financial planning that are considered effective for
managing personal finances, but are also congruent with specific user inputs.

In this paper, we set out to bridge the traditional econometric methods of financial
planning with the power of AI-driven recommendations. By considering the LLM’s sugges-
tions as a foundation , we refine and optimize budget allocations for both individuals and
households. Our approach strives to achieve a balance between mathematical optimization
and real-world practicality, ensuring that the solutions are not just economically sound but
also feasible and user-friendly.

In practical terms, when artificial neural networks (ANNs), including DL and LLMs,
are trained through supervised learning, they employ a learning rule that iteratively
converges toward an equilibrium, finely balancing the dilemma of underfitting versus
overfitting. Despite their ability to discern nonlinear continuous transformations, their oper-
ational mechanics do not inherently encapsulate an internal representation of the nonlinear
relationships between training exemplars [6]. The consequence of this limitation is twofold:
firstly, when ANNs process data with inter-relations confined within Euclidean boundaries,
they excel; secondly, when confronted with data existing beyond these confines, the results
may not only be suboptimal but also unpredictably aberrant. This limitation is similar, in
many respects, to the constraints encountered in traditional statistical regression methods.
In the subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies that we have de-
veloped for individual and cooperative financial planning, elucidate on the integration
of LLMs in these methods, and present the results of our preliminary tests. Through this
exploration, we hope to usher in a new paradigm in financial planning, one that is more
accessible, efficient, and in tune with the unique needs of today’s diverse society. That
being said, it is also necessary to recognize the potential limitations and inherent risks of AI,
such as errors and hallucinations, and the strategies that can be implemented to mitigate
these issues, such as rigorous validation processes, the constant monitoring of AI outputs,
and the incorporation of fail-safes and human oversight.

The essence of this study lies in addressing a critical challenge: the democratization
of financial planning in a landscape riddled with complexity and unpredictability. Our
work is driven by the imperative to equip individuals and households with the tools to
navigate the economic maze toward sustainable financial health. The problem statement is
twofold—firstly, the need to simplify the intricacies of financial decision making for the
non-expert and, secondly, to create an adaptive system that is resilient to the volatile nature
of economic dynamics.

Our motivation is rooted in the recognition that financial security and literacy are
cornerstones of individual autonomy and societal well-being. We propose an innovative
solution that intersects the predictive acuity of LLMs with the foundational constructs of
econometrics. The mathematical core of our approach is to optimize a utility function U
that encapsulates the financial health of an entity, of the form:

U(I, E) = α log(S) − β

n
∑
o=1

wo log(Eo)

(1)

where I is income, S is savings, E represents expenses across n categories, wo are the
personalized preference weights, and α, β are parameters calibrating the trade-off between
savings and expenditures. Through this formulation, we seek to craft a system that not
only provides bespoke financial advice but also evolves with the user’s changing economic
scenario, embodying the fluidity required for real-world financial planning.

The problem at the heart of our research is the incremental complexity of personal
financial management in a rapidly evolving economic landscape. In an age where financial
instruments and markets are increasingly intricate, the average individual is at a significant
disadvantage when attempting to plan for financial security. This challenge is not merely

AI 2024, 5

academic but a pressing real-world issue that affects the quality of life and long-term
well-being of individuals and families. The need for accessible financial planning is further
highlighted by the widening gap in financial literacy, which can lead to poor financial
decisions and increased economic inequality.

Our work is motivated by the imperative to render financial planning not only more
approachable but also more aligned with the diverse and dynamic financial goals of
individuals. We aim to address this by leveraging the computational prowess of LLMs to
distill complex financial data into actionable insights. The mathematical underpinning of
our approach is an optimization framework, tailored to the nuances of personal finance,
which can be represented as:

{U(x) : x ∈ F , G(x) ≤ 0, H(x) = 0}

max
x

(2)

Here, x symbolizes the financial decision variables, U is the utility function that quan-
tifies financial health, F defines the feasible set based on financial constraints, G represents
inequality constraints (such as budget limits), and H captures equality constraints (such as
income–expense balance). Our motivation is to implement a system that empowers users
with personalized, intelligent recommendations, thus equipping them to make informed
financial choices in pursuit of economic resilience and prosperity.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides related work.
Section 3 focuses on the materials and methodology adopted, presenting the foundational
aspects and research methodology pertinent to the optimization models. In Section 4, we ex-
plore the significance of LLMs in individual budgeting, emphasizing their recommendation-
driven approach to financial planning. Section 5 offers an in-depth look into cooperative
financial planning for households, showcasing the synergistic view between LLM recom-
mendations and household members’ financial priorities. The subsequent Section 6 presents
the intricacies of cooperative budgeting within an established extended coevolutionary (EC)
framework, elucidating its innovative facets. Moving forward, Section 7 describes our sim-
ulation framework, detailing how LLM-informed decisions can be simulated and analyzed,
while also highlighting in Section 7.3 the importance of long-term planning dependencies
to further develop the simulated framework. Finally, in Section 8, we draw our conclusions,
recapitulating the primary findings and looking ahead at promising directions for future
work in this domain.

2. Related Work

The landscape of financial planning and optimization has been deeply enriched by
the intersection of computational intelligence and economic theories. In this section, we
contextualize our contributions within the spectrum of existing literature, delineating the
evolution of financial planning methodologies from traditional models to AI-augmented
frameworks.

Traditional financial planning has been heavily influenced by seminal works such as
those of Markowitz [7] on portfolio optimization and Ando and Modigliani’s life-cycle
hypothesis [8]. The optimization of financial assets has been extensively studied, with
methods ranging from linear programming [9] to more sophisticated stochastic models
[10].

The infusion of behavioral economics into financial optimization models has provided
a more thorough understanding of human financial behavior, as evidenced by the works of
Thaler and others [11]. This has led to models that account for irrational decision making
and heuristics used by individuals, adding complexity to the optimization problems [12].
The advent of AI [13,14] in financial planning has opened new avenues for personal-
ized and adaptive financial advice. Early systems utilized rule-based expert systems [15],
while recent advancements have leveraged machine learning for predictive analytics in
finance [16].

The integration of LLMs [4] into financial planning is a relatively new and emerging
field. Recent studies have begun to explore the capabilities of models like OpenAI’s GPT

AI 2024, 5

series and explainable AI techniques in generating financial narratives [17,18]. Our work
extends this line of research by embedding LLM insights into the optimization framework,
a novel approach that has not been extensively covered in the existing literature.

Comparative studies have highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of AI-driven
financial tools compared to traditional methods [19–21]. However, there remains a gap
in the literature regarding the efficacy of LLM recommendations within the cooperative
budgeting context, an area our research directly addresses.

While existing works provide a foundational understanding of the financial opti-
mization landscape, there remains a lacuna when it comes to the integration of real-time,
AI-driven, personalized recommendations into these models. Our research fills this gap
by not only integrating but also critically examining and refining the role of LLMs within
financial planning and optimization frameworks.

In summary, our research builds upon the rich heritage of financial optimization while
branching into the relatively uncharted territory of LLM-augmented financial planning. By
doing so, we aim to contribute a significant advancement in the domain, tailored for the
dynamic economic world of the 21st century.

3. Materials and Methodology

This research proposes an optimization model for individual and cooperative financial
planning, both enhanced by the integration of large language model (LLM) recommenda-
tions. The two primary facets of this approach are: (1) foundational mathematical models
that describe budgeting optimization problems, and (2) computational algorithms that
incorporate the LLM’s recommendations into financial decision-making processes.

The objective of maximizing savings by allocating monthly income across various
expense categories is grounded in core principles of theory in household finance. This
approach aligns with the life-cycle hypothesis of Ando and Modigliani (1963) [8], which
posits that individuals plan their consumption and savings behavior over their lifetime
to achieve financial stability. Furthermore, it reflects the principles of optimal portfolio
selection from the theory of modern portfolio of Markowitz (1952) [7], adapted to the
context of household budgeting, where the portfolio is a mix of expenses and savings.

Our model also incorporates the behavioral aspects of financial decision making
as discussed by Xiao (2008) [22], acknowledging that individuals have varying prefer-
ences and subjective weights on different expense categories. Additionally, Browning and
Lusardi’s (1996) research on micro theories and micro facts of household saving [23] pro-
vides empirical support for the relevance of optimizing savings behavior at the household
level.

For the cooperative financial recommendation model, we draw on these individual
financial behaviors and extend them to a household context, considering the collective
utility maximization and shared financial responsibilities, resonating with the cooperative
game theory in household economics [24].

Individual Financial Recommendation Model
Objective: Our primary goal is to find the best allocation of an individual’s monthly in-
come across various expense categories while maximizing their potential savings
[7,8,22,23].

Variables:

•
•
•

I : Monthly income.
Ez : Expense for category z (e.g., rent, groceries, utility bills, entertainment).
S : Savings for the month.

Objective Function: This function emphasizes maximizing savings after covering all

necessary expenses.

Maximize S = I − ∑
z

Ez.

(3)

AI 2024, 5

95

Constraints: The constraints ensure non-negative expenses, savings, and that total

expenses do not surpass the monthly income.

Ez ≥ 0 ∀z,
S ≥ 0,
Ez ≤ I.

∑
z

(6)

Cooperative Financial Recommendation Model (Household)
Objective:
In a household setting, our aim is to optimize combined budget allocation for all
members. We ensure that each member’s preferences and necessities are accommodated,
aiming for an overall maximization of household savings.

•
•
•
•

Variables:
Io : Monthly income of member o.
Ezo : Expense for category z by member o.
So : Savings for the month by member o.
TS : Total combined savings of the household.
Objective Function:
This function prioritizes the overall savings of the household, given each member’s

income and expenses.

Maximize TS = ∑

(Io − ∑

Ezo).

o

z

(7)

Constraints:
The constraints are extensions of the individual model but factor in multiple members.

∑
z

Ezo ≥ 0 ∀z, o,
So ≥ 0 ∀o,
Ezo ≤ Io ∀o,

TS = ∑

So.

o

(9)

(10)

(11)

Preferences/Weights:
To personalize the model, we introduce weights wzo representing the importance of
an expense category z for member o. This ensures that individual preferences are not lost
in the collective model.

Maximize TS = ∑

(Io − ∑

wzoEzo).

o

z

(12)

Collaborative Constraint:
Factoring in shared expenses, such as rent, can lead to substantial savings. Therefore,

we introduce a combined expense constraint.

Erent, combined ≤ Erent,1 + Erent,2.

(13)

Incorporating LLM Recommendations
The true innovation of our approach lies in blending traditional optimization tech-
niques with AI-driven insights [25,26]. The LLM’s vast knowledge base and advanced
language processing capabilities can provide nuanced, context-aware recommendations for
individuals and households.

Given a recommendation Rz from the LLM for an expense category z, we can adjust

our initial financial allocations.

Ez ≈ Rz ∀z.

(14)

AI 2024, 5

96

With these LLM-generated insights serving as a foundation, the optimization model
can be fine-tuned at a later stage to suit specific needs, balancing mathematical accuracy
with real-world financial insights.

3.1. Prospective Validation Framework for AI-Driven LLM Financial Recommendations

This framework can be designed to uphold the integrity and applicability of AI-driven
insights, ensuring that they are not only relevant but also conform to the highest standards
of financial prudence.

A multi-tiered verification process that scrutinizes the LLM output for reliability and

truthfulness can be proposed. This process would involve:

•

•

•

•

Expert Review: Each LLM-generated recommendation is evaluated by financial ex-
perts to ensure that it is consistent with established economic principles and real-world
conditions. Experts may modify LLM suggestions to correct any inaccuracies or to
better align with conservative financial practices.
Contextual Analysis: The model contextualizes LLM responses by examining them
against current financial trends, regulatory guidelines, and economic indicators. This
ensures that the advice is not only mathematically sound but also practical, taking
into account the socio-economic environment of the users.
Risk Assessment: Risk analysis is conducted to evaluate the potential harm that could
arise from following the LLM’s advice. This includes stress testing the recommenda-
tions against various economic scenarios to gauge their resilience and adaptability.
Ethical Considerations: An ethical review is performed to ensure that the LLM’s
advice does not inadvertently lead to financial decisions that could be detrimental to
the user’s long-term well-being or that could perpetuate biases.

The objective function within the optimization framework would be then defined

as follows:

Maximize U(S, E, C) = f (S) − g(E, C)

(15)

where U(S, E, C) is the utility function dependent on savings S, a vector of expenses E, and
a context vector C that includes both economic conditions and user-specific circumstances.
The function f (S) quantifies the utility derived from savings, emphasizing the goal of
maximization, while g(E, C) is a penalty function that increases when expenses are either
economically unsound or potentially harmful.

To integrate LLM insights effectively, a constraint adaptation strategy can be employed
where LLM recommendations adjust the boundaries of the feasible solution space rather
than dictating fixed allocations. This would allows us to maintain a flexible yet controlled
optimization environment where LLM inputs serve as informed guidelines rather than
rigid directives. The optimization problem would then become:

Maximize U(S, E, C)
subject to Emin ≤ E ≤ ELLM,

S + ∑ E ≤ I,
S, E ≥ 0,

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where Emin and ELLM are vectors of minimum and LLM-recommended expenses,
respectively.

Through this meticulous approach, we can ensure that the financial planning method-
ologies proposed in this study are not only innovative and AI-enhanced but are also
reliable, ethically responsible, and practically applicable in a variety of financial contexts.
This methodology, with the proposal of a thorough validation mechanism, sets a precedent
for the responsible integration of AI in the sensitive realm of personal finance.

AI 2024, 5

3.2. RAG Approach with LLM Recommendations

Additionally, to address the potential for LLM hallucination, the methodology could
integrate a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach into the recommendation
generation process. This sophisticated mechanism can enhance the robustness of the LLM’s
outputs by anchoring its responses in verifiable data, thereby significantly reducing the
likelihood of generating spurious or misleading financial advice.

The RAG process can operate by first querying a large-scale dataset of financial
information, regulatory guidelines, and historical economic data. The LLM then synthesizes
this retrieved information with its pre-trained knowledge to generate recommendations that
are not only contextually rich but also data-grounded. Here is how the RAG methodology
could be incorporated:

• Data Retrieval: Prior to recommendation generation, the LLM queries a curated
dataset to retrieve relevant financial data and historical trends that mirror the user’s
query context.

•

• Augmented Generation: The model combines its own language-understanding capa-
bilities with the retrieved data to generate a draft recommendation. This step ensures
that each piece of advice is informed by empirical data, thereby enhancing its accuracy
and relevance.
Validation and Refinement: The draft recommendation is then passed through a
validation filter, which includes a comparison against up-to-date financial models and
a check for compliance with current economic conditions.
Expert Oversight: The final stage can involve human oversight, where financial experts
review the LLM-generated advice to ensure that it adheres to professional standards
and reflects sound financial judgment.

•

The incorporation of RAG into our recommendation generation process can be mathe-
matically represented in the optimization model as an additional set of constraints that the
LLM’s responses must satisfy:

RAG(E, D) → ELLM

(20)

where RAG(E, D) represents the RAG process with expenses E and retrieved data D,
mapping to the LLM’s recommended expenses ELLM.

Incorporating the RAG methodology into the LLM framework could significantly
mitigate the risk of hallucinations by ensuring that the model’s recommendations are
continuously grounded in empirical evidence. It can also provide an additional layer of
confidence in the model’s outputs, reinforcing their reliability for end-users seeking sound
financial planning advice.

4. LLM-Informed Budgeting

In the modern era of data-driven solutions, using an LLM to provide financial advice
offers an innovative approach to household budgeting. Given the intricate nature of
individual spending habits and the myriad of ways in which funds can be allocated, using
the power of AI can significantly enhance personalized financial recommendations.

The value addition of our research to the field of financial planning lies in the novel
synthesis of econometric modeling and state-of-the-art AI. By integrating the insights
from LLMs into traditional financial planning frameworks, we provide a multi-faceted
approach that aligns with the contemporary demand for personalized financial advice. This
integration heralds a significant shift from one-size-fits-all financial advisories to solutions
that respect individual financial narratives and the unique economic contexts that they
exist in.

Our models offer significant improvements over existing methodologies by incorpo-
rating behavioral economic factors and real-time data analysis, thereby delivering a more
granular and responsive financial planning tool. The mathematical model that encapsulates
our approach can be represented as:

AI 2024, 5

98

U(x, θ)

subject to x ∈ F (Ψ), G(x, Φ) ≤ 0, H(x, Λ) = 0

(21)

max
x

Here, x denotes the vector of decision variables for financial planning, U is the utility
function enhanced by LLM insights θ, F represents the feasible region influenced by
external data Ψ, and G, H are the sets of constraints parameterized by Φ and Λ, respectively,
signifying economic conditions and user preferences. The LLM’s capability to digest and
interpret large volumes of data transcends the capabilities of traditional methods, thus
enabling our model to adaptively recalibrate recommendations in accordance with the
fluctuating economic indicators and personal financial goals.

Moreover, the transformative potential of our methodology becomes particularly
salient when considering the adaptability of LLMs to a changing information landscape,
a feature that conventional financial planning tools lack. By continually learning from
new data, our model remains at the forefront of financial planning innovation, marking
a decisive step toward a more intelligent, adaptable, and personalized financial plan-
ning paradigm.

The approach leverages the capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to analyze a
user’s financial data and provide a bespoke recommendation based on that data. The
process involves:

1.
2.
3.

Data Input: Users provide a breakdown of their monthly income and primary expenses.
LLM Analysis: The model evaluates the data in the context of sound financial planning.
Recommendation Generation: The LLM then offers a detailed recommendation on
how the user might best allocate their remaining funds.

The Python script, get_financial_recommendation, takes a string representation of

the user’s financial data and attempts to retrieve or generate a recommendation.

Key features of the script include:

•

•

Caching Mechanism: To enhance efficiency, the script maintains a
recommendation_cache. If the user’s financial data match a previous entry, a stored
recommendation is returned without invoking the LLM, thereby saving computational
resources and time.
Robust Error Handling: Recognizing the potential for API errors or timeouts, the script
employs a retry mechanism with exponential backoff. This ensures that transient issues
do not lead to immediate failures and offers a resilient approach.

• User-Friendly Output: The LLM’s response is parsed to retrieve a clear, concise

recommendation that is then returned to the user.

Here, we describe an example for clarity. Consider a user with a monthly income of
USD 5000 and major expenses that include USD 1200 for rent, USD 400 for groceries, USD
200 for utilities, and USD 100 for entertainment. When they input these data, the LLM
could provide a recommendation like:

“Based on your financial data for the month, after accounting for your major
expenses, you have $2100 remaining. I recommend allocating $500 towards an
emergency fund, $300 towards investments, $200 for miscellaneous expenses,
and saving the remaining $1100.”

Advantages of the LLM Approach:

1.

2.

3.

Personalization: Unlike generic financial advice, the LLM approach tailors recommen-
dations to the individual’s unique financial situation.
Scalability: The approach can cater to a vast number of users simultaneously, making
it suitable for integration into financial planning apps or platforms.
Learning Over Time: As LLMs evolve and receive more training, the quality and
depth of their recommendations can only improve.

While the current implementation provides robust financial recommendations, future

versions could:

AI 2024, 5

•
•

•

Integrate real-time data sources to provide up-to-the-minute advice.
Consider longer-term financial goals, such as buying a home or retirement planning,
in its recommendations.
Incorporate user feedback to continually refine and enhance recommendations.

In conclusion, using LLMs for household financial recommendations represents a sig-
nificant step forward in the marriage of AI and financial planning. By offering personalized,
scalable, and increasingly sophisticated advice, this approach promises to revolutionize the
way individuals manage their finances.

Figure 1 delineates the proposed financial planning methodology that makes use
of the capabilities of LLMs to enhance data analysis and supports the formulation of
robust recommendations. This schematic presents a sequence of interconnected stages
starting with the aggregation of financial data, proceeding to an in-depth analysis phase,
which converge into the application of LLM insights for the generation of tailored financial
recommendations. The iterative cycle is fundamental for maintaining the relevancy and
efficacy of the financial plan, adapting dynamically to the evolving economic landscape
and individual and cooperative financial objectives.

4.1. Verification Mechanism for LLM-Generated Financial Advice

In our approach, we could ensure the alignment of the LLM-generated recommenda-
tions with established financial truths by implementing a verification mechanism within
the Python script: get_financial_recommendation . This mechanism can cross-reference the
recommendations against a comprehensive financial database that includes a wide array
of economic indicators, historical financial data, and regulatory compliance requirements.
Here, we describe the process in detail:

•

•

•

•

Recommendation Generation: The script first invokes the LLM to generate a prelimi-
nary financial recommendation based on the user’s input data.
Database Cross-Reference: Upon obtaining the LLM’s output, the script automatically
queries a financial database, seeking corroboration for the proposed financial strategies.
This database is consistently updated to reflect the latest financial truths, including
market trends, tax laws, and industry standards.
Truth Alignment Check: The script compares the LLM’s recommendation against the
database entries to verify the accuracy and relevance of the advice. Recommendations
that significantly diverge from the financial truths are flagged for further review.
Feedback Loop for Adjustment: In cases where discrepancies arise, the script adjusts
the recommendations by applying a set of heuristic rules derived from the financial
truths. This iterative process ensures that the final advice provided to the user is both
data-driven and aligned with financial realities.

• Human Expert Review: The last step involves a financial expert who reviews and,
if necessary, refines the script’s output to ensure full compliance with financial
best practices.

AI 2024, 5

100

Mathematically, this verification mechanism can be represented as a constraint satis-
faction problem, where the generated recommendations R must satisfy a set of conditions
C based on the truths T from the financial database D:

∀r ∈ R, ∃t ∈ T : C(r, t) → Valid Recommendation.

(22)

Incorporating this truth-checking protocol could enhance the reliability of our LLM-
informed budgeting system, ensuring that users receive recommendations that are not only
personalized but also pragmatically sound and financially valid.

4.2. Prompt Engineering for Improved LLM Financial Recommendations

To empower users in optimizing their interactions with the LLM, we can also introduce
a guided prompt optimization feature within our LLM-informed budgeting system. This
enhancement can educate users on constructing effective prompts, thereby improving the
quality of the financial recommendations that they receive. Here is how we can incorporate
this guidance into the user experience:

•

•

Prompt Templates: We provide users with a collection of prompt templates that are
designed based on successful financial inquiry patterns. These templates serve as
starting points for users to articulate their financial data and questions.
Prompt Feedback Mechanism: After users submit their prompts, our system analyzes
the prompt structure and provides instant feedback on how to refine it for clearer
communication and better-aligned financial recommendations.

•

• Adaptive Learning from User Interaction: As users interact with the system, it can
employ ML algorithms to learn from the quality of recommendations generated from
past prompts. The system then suggests modifications to the prompts for future
queries, aiming to maximize the relevance and precision of the recommendations.
Informative Tutorials and Tips: Alongside direct feedback, users have access to educa-
tional materials that explain the principles of effective prompt construction, including
clarity, specificity, and the inclusion of relevant financial context.
Expert System Insights: A built-in expert system analyzes user prompts and compares
them with a database of optimized prompts and their outcomes. By highlighting key
differences, the system offers actionable insights for users to improve their queries.

•

Mathematically, this process can be viewed as an optimization problem where the aim
is to maximize the utility U of a prompt P with respect to the quality Q of the recommenda-
tion R as follows:

U(P)

s.t. Q(R|P) is maximized.

max
P

(23)

The function U(P) denotes the utility of the prompt, which is a function of its effec-
tiveness in generating high-quality recommendations Q(R|P). By iteratively refining P
based on system feedback and learning, we can ensure a continuous improvement in the
prompt’s utility.

4.3. EC Theory for Household Finance: Beyond Euclidean Domains

The extended coevolutionary (EC) theory provides a sophisticated framework that
allows us to navigate beyond the intrinsic limitations of ANNs. While these models
might struggle with capturing the intricacies of non-Euclidean spaces due to their reliance
on linear transformations within a Euclidean framework, EC theory embraces a more
holistic view.

EC theory, through its foundational principles of coadaptation and coevolution, inher-
ently accounts for the complex and dynamic inter-relationships characteristic of real-world
scenarios, which often extend beyond linearly definable spaces. This adaptability is made
possible by EC theory’s capacity to model interactions within a multi-dimensional space

AI 2024, 5

101

that can effectively represent the high-level abstractions and nonlinear interdependencies
of financial data.

∆x(t + 1) = F(x(t), x(t − 1), . . . , x(0)).

(24)
Here, ∆x(t + 1) represents the change in the strategy vector at time t + 1, and F
encapsulates a nonlinear function of the strategy vectors at all previous time steps, capturing
the essence of iterative learning and strategic adaptation over time. This function F is
not restricted to the confines of a Euclidean space, enabling the EC model to explore a
more diverse solution space and offering a robust mechanism for identifying equilibria in
complex systems.

Furthermore, the EC theory facilitates the integration of external insights, such as
those derived from LLMs, into its evolutionary process. By considering the LLM outputs
as auxiliary data points, the EC model can refine its strategic outlook, effectively bridging
the gap between the traditional optimization techniques and the high-dimensional space of
AI-driven recommendations.

x(t + 1) = x(t) + γ(R − x(t)) + ∆x(t + 1).

(25)

In the equation above, γ represents the rate of integration of LLM recommendations
denoted by R into the current strategy x(t). The term ∆x(t + 1), as previously defined,
ensures that the EC model dynamically evolves, reflecting both the insights from LLMs
and the iterative learning process.

By leveraging the flexibility and multidimensional approach of EC theory, we can
transcend the traditional limitations posed by ANNs. This progressive modeling approach
not only aligns with the complex nature of financial ecosystems but also offers a robust
platform for developing advanced financial planning tools that are both comprehensive
and capable of evolving in tandem with the changing economic landscape.

5. LLM Cooperative Budgeting and Financial Planning for Households

Cooperative budgeting emerges as an imperative when multiple individuals, such
as partners or roommates, decide to combine their financial resources and manage ex-
penses collectively. By jointly analyzing incomes and costs, households can better allo-
cate resources, set shared financial goals, and plan for both short-term needs and long-
term objectives.

The provided Python script, get_cooperative_financial_recommendation, seeks to
tap into the potential of LLMs to generate budgeting advice tailored for households that
are pooling their resources.

Key Script Features:

•

•

•

Repetitive queries are bypassed by maintaining a
Caching Mechanism:
recommendation_cache. If data from a household match a prior request, the cached
recommendation is returned, thereby conserving computational effort.
Retry with Exponential Backoff: The script is robust against potential API timeouts
or other exceptions. By employing a retry mechanism that increases the waiting time
after each attempt, it provides resilience against transient issues.
Tailored Recommendations: The response from the LLM is parsed to yield a succinct
and actionable cooperative financial recommendation for the household.

Sample Use Case

Consider a household comprising two members:

• Member 1 with an income of USD 5000, paying rent of USD 800 and spending USD 300

on groceries.

• Member 2 earning USD 4000, having a rent of USD 700 and grocery expenses amounting

to USD 350.

Upon feeding these combined data to the LLM, a recommendation could emerge as:

AI 2024, 5

102

“Given the combined income and individual expenses, the household has a re-
maining amount of $7850 after rent and groceries. It is advised to allocate $1500
for joint savings, $1000 for utilities and shared amenities, $500 towards entertain-
ment and leisure, and set aside $1000 as an emergency fund. The residual amount
can be directed towards individual savings or other shared financial goals.”

Benefits of Collaborative Budgeting:

1.

2.

Shared Responsibility: Distributing financial responsibilities can alleviate individual
burdens and promote mutual accountability.
Strategic Decision Making: With pooled resources, households can make more in-
formed choices about investments, large purchases, and savings.

3. Achievement of Common Goals: Be it buying a new home, planning a vacation, or
preparing for family expansions, cooperative budgeting can expedite the realization
of shared aspirations.

Enhancements for the Future:
The script, while effective, can be augmented further by:

•

•

•

Incorporating feedback mechanisms where household members can adjust recommen-
dations based on changing financial scenarios.
Integrating data from financial institutions in real-time for more current and accurate
recommendations.
Introducing functionalities to handle more complex financial situations, such as in-
vestments, loans, and mortgages.

In essence, cooperative budgeting facilitated by AI-driven models can revolutionize
the way households manage their finances, promoting a culture of transparency, mutual
trust, and shared financial growth.

6. Cooperative Budgeting within the EC Framework

Cooperative budgeting for households represents a tangible instantiation of the ex-
tended coevolutionary (EC) framework’s principles first introduced in [27]. By analyzing
this in the context of the EC theory, we illuminate the synergistic confluence of game-
theoretic models, LLMs, and adaptive learning in practical MAS scenarios.

Let us consider a household H consisting of n members, where each member o is an
agent. Each agent has a financial profile characterized by its income Io and expenses Eo.
The collective budget of the household can be expressed as:

BH =

n
∑
o=1

Io − Eo.

(26)

The goal is to cooperatively allocate a common budget BH across members to optimize
some household-wide utility function UH. This utility can be a measure of financial stability,
savings, or any other metric significant to the household.

Incorporating the adaptive learning mechanism from the EC framework, each agent o
iteratively adjusts its expenses Eo based on a derived utility Uo that takes into account the
household’s collective goal and individual preferences. The adjustment can be mathemati-
cally represented analogous to the previous equation as:

Eo(t + 1) = Eo(t) + α∇Uo(Eo(t), E−o(t)).

(27)

Here, α remains the learning rate, and ∇Uo signifies the gradient of utility with respect

to agent o’s expenses, considering other agents’ expenses as E−o.

The strategy of agent o, specifically its expense Eo, can be influenced by recommenda-
tions from an LLM. Representing the LLM’s recommendation for agent o at time t as Ro,t,
and similar to the equation presented before, the new expense can be modeled as:

Eo(t + 1) = (1 − β)(Eo(t) + α∇Uo(Eo(t), E−o(t))) + βRo,t.

(28)

AI 2024, 5

103

Here, β designates the influence rate of the LLM on the agent’s expense strategy.
Given that LLM recommendations, like budget suggestions, come with inherent
uncertainties, a confidence measure Co,t associated with each recommendation Ro,t should
be considered. This is analogous to the previous equation, and the updated expense can be
modeled as:

Eo(t + 1) = (1 − βCo,t)(Eo(t) + α∇Uo(Eo(t), E−o(t))) + βCo,tRo,t.

(29)

Each household member may have distinct financial priorities and constraints, echoing
the EC theory’s emphasis on heterogeneous agents. The utility for each agent Uo would
thus encapsulate individual preferences, like risk aversion or future financial goals.

The cooperative budgeting scenario for households aptly demonstrates the applicabil-
ity of the EC theory in real-world contexts. This intersection of theoretical constructs with
tangible applications showcases the robustness and versatility of the EC framework. The
use of mathematical representations deepens our understanding, offering a quantitative
lens to perceive the dynamics of the household as a multi-agent system influenced by
adaptive learning and LLMs.

Linear Optimization Model for Financial Planning with LLM Constraints

Another instance of the same financial planning scenario is the following, where
we propose to use the LLM recommendation as bounds of the optimization model. We
construct a linear optimization model to distribute the monthly income I across various
expense categories while maximizing potential savings. The model is formulated as follows:
Let I represent the monthly income of a household, and Ez represent the expenses in
category z, where z can be rent, groceries, utility bills, or entertainment. Let S denote the
savings for the month. The goal is to maximize S subject to the constraints imposed by the
financial data and recommendations from the LLM.

The objective function and constraints are presented as follows:

Maximize S = I − ∑
z

Ez

Ez ≥ 0 ∀z,
S ≥ 0,
Ez ≤ I,

∑
z

(Non-negativity of expenses)

(Non-negativity of savings)

(Total expenses do not exceed income)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

Additional constraints are derived from the LLM recommendations, which suggest
percentages of income to be allocated toward each category. Let pz be the percentage of
income recommended for category z, and Erec
z be the recommended expenses calculated as
pz · I. We can introduce bounds based on these recommendations to guide the optimization:

Ez ≥ Emin
Ez ≤ Erec
,

is a lower bound to ensure that each category meets essential spending require-

z

7. Simulation Framework: LLM-Informed Decisions

To comprehend the LLM’s effectiveness in financial advice, it is essential to assess
its recommendations. Let us delve into its suggestions for individual and cooperative
financial management:

AI 2024, 5

7.1. User Financial Recommendation

OpenAI model: gpt4-0613

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model="gpt-4-0613", messages=[ {"role":
"system", "content": "You are an expert financial planner with extensive knowledge
in household finance and budgeting. Provide a detailed recommendation on how to
allocate funds based on the given data."}, {"role": "user", "content": f"Here’s my finan-
cial data for the month: {income_data_string}. Can you provide a recommendation
on how I should spend or save the remaining funds?"} ] )

The instruction given to the model focused on its expertise as a financial planner. This
query is indicative of how the LLM would process individual financial data and provide a
comprehensive recommendation.

LLM User Financial Recommendation

Of course, based on your provided income and expenditure, your total spending
adds up to $1900 out of $5000. This leaves you with a remaining balance of $3100.
Let’s break down and allocate your remaining balance as follows:
1. **Emergency Fund**: If you don’t already have an emergency fund, aim to build
one. This should consist of 3–6 months’ worth of living expenses to cover unexpected
costs, such as a medical emergency or car repair. If you don’t have such a fund pot,
then it’s good to allocate around 20% ($620) of the remaining money towards it.
2. **Retirement Savings**: If you’re not currently contributing to a retirement fund,
it’s a good idea to start. A general rule is to allocate 15–20% of your income towards
your retirement. In this case from the remaining sum, consider allocating 20% ($620).
3. **Debt Payments**: If you have any outstanding debt like student loans, credit
card debt, etc, it’s crucial to allocate a portion of your income towards paying these
off. For now, from this remaining balance you could allocate 15% ($465).
4. **Personal Savings/Investments**: It’s always a good idea to invest in your future,
whether it means buying a house, starting your own business, or taking a vacation.
You could aim to allocate 20% ($620) for this purpose.
5. **Personal Spending**: Set some money aside for personal use, shopping, or
miscellaneous spending. Around 10% ($310) could be allocated for this purpose.
6. **Health and Fitness**: Consider this as an investment in your health. Allocate
about 5% ($155).
7. **Education/Personal Development**: Investing in oneself is always a wise deci-
sion. 5% of the remaining money which would be around $155 could be dedicated
for this purpose.
8. **Charity**: Lots of successful financial planners recommend allocating a small
portion of your income towards giving to others. Around 5% ($155) should be again
a good start.
Here’s how the final allocation looks like:

•
Emergency Fund: $620
•
Retirement Savings: $620
•
Debt payments: $465
•
Personal Savings/Investments: $620
Personal Spending: $310
•
• Health and Fitness: $155
•
•

Education/Personal Development: $155
Charity: $155

Analysis: The recommendation begins by acknowledging the user’s financial state,
ensuring transparency in the LLM’s calculations. The model then meticulously divides the

AI 2024, 5

105

leftover funds into eight categories. These categories represent the fundamental areas that
most individuals need to consider in their financial planning. The proportional allocation
seems balanced and encourages both saving and investing while also emphasizing personal
well-being and community giving.

This framework aligns well with traditional financial planning advice, indicating
the model’s efficacy in this domain. Moreover, the clarity and structure provided by the
model can greatly assist users in understanding their financial standing and planning their
future expenditures.

7.2. Cooperative Financial Recommendation

OpenAI model: gpt4-0613

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model="gpt-4-0613", messages=[ {"role":
"system", "content": "You are an expert financial planner with expertise in coopera-
tive budgeting for households. Provide a comprehensive recommendation based
on the combined financial data."}, {"role": "user", "content": f"Here’s our combined
household financial data: {household_data_string}. Can you recommend how we
should collaboratively budget our expenses?"} ] )

In this inquiry, the model was tasked with providing a comprehensive recommen-
dation based on combined financial data, embodying the complexities of cooperative
budgeting for households.

Analysis: The model adopts a detailed approach to cooperative financial planning,
starting with a clear breakdown of combined income and essential expenses like housing
and groceries. The percentages used to allocate various expenses, such as housing taking
up 25–30% of the income, align with widely accepted financial guidelines.

A particularly noteworthy aspect of this recommendation is the inclusion of an emer-
gency fund, highlighting the LLM’s capacity to foresee potential financial pitfalls and its
alignment with prudent financial practices.

The cooperative recommendation, much like the individual one, is comprehensive,
detailed, and aligns with standard financial planning guidelines. This reinforces the model’s
reliability in producing accurate and actionable financial advice.

AI 2024, 5

106

LLM Cooperative Financial Recommendation

Absolutely. Here’s a comprehensive budgeting plan based on the combined finan-
cial data:
1. **Income Analysis:** Your combined total monthly income is $5000 + $4000 = $9000.
2. **Housing Expenses:** Your combined rent is $800 + $700 = $1500, which is 16.67%
of your income. Considering that housing should generally be around 25–30% of
your income, you’re in a good position here.
3. **Grocery Expenses:** Your combined grocery cost is $300 + $350 = $650 per
month. This cost is approximately 7.2% of your total income which is below the
usual 10–15% range. You are so far managing this expense effectively but there may
be room for improved nutrition or desired treats within this budget.
4. **Savings:** A good rule of thumb would be to save at least 20% of your income.
In your case, that would be $1800 per month.
5. **Other Expenses:** After accounting for rent, groceries and savings, you have
$4050 left each month ($9000 − $1500 − $650 − $1800). You should use this remaining
money to cover other expenses. It would be advisable to distribute it as follows:

•
•
•

•

•

**Utilities: 5–10% of income:** This would be about $450–$900.
**Healthcare: 5–10% of income:** This should be approximately $450–$900.
**Transportation: 10–15% of income:** This should ideally be between $900–
$1350.
**Recreational & Personal Expenses: 5–10% of income:** This is typically $450–
$900.
**Retirement Contribution: At least 10% of income:** This would be $900 in
your case.

This distribution may vary based on your personal needs, lifestyle, debt repayments,
and obligations. It would be wise to keep track of your expenses to ensure you’re
in-line with your set budget.
6. **Emergency Fund:** It is also important to ensure that you have an emergency
fund in place. Ideally, this fund should cover 3–6 months’ worth of living expenses,
and given your expense rate, this should be somewhere between $10,800–$21,600. If
you do not have an adequate emergency fund in place, then portion of your savings
should be allocated to this fund until the target is met.
End of the day, the goal is to ensure the income is distributed in a way that covers
all the needs, while also ensuring there’s financial growth and stability. Regularly
revisit your budget and adjust accordingly based on changes in income, expenses,
and financial goals.

7.3. The Significance of Long-Term Models in Financial Planning

Financial planning [28,29], at its core, is not just about budgeting for the next month or
year: it is about laying a foundation for the entire life-cycle [30,31]. Decisions made today
will inevitably impact financial security, flexibility, and wealth accumulation in the distant
future. With this understanding, there arises an imperative need for long-term models in
the domain of financial planning.

Long-term models bring foresight to financial decision making. By analyzing long-
term implications of current financial data, these models offer recommendations that are
not just about immediate benefit but also cater to future financial health. The importance of
long-term models becomes even more pronounced in situations that involve uncertainties
like changing job markets, economic fluctuations, or personal life events.

Here is a glimpse into the key benefits and functionalities of long-term models in the

financial domain:

•

Consumption Smoothing: Long-term models assist in balancing consumption patterns
over time, ensuring that individuals do not overspend during prosperous periods or

AI 2024, 5

107

face hardship during lean times. By forecasting future income streams and financial
obligations, long-term models promote consistent living standards throughout an
individual’s life.
Life-cycle Modeling: These models simulate various stages of an individual’s life,
from early career stages, potential family planning, and mid-life crises, to retirement.
By doing so, they help in preparing for financial needs and challenges typical to
each phase.
Risk Management: LLMs highlight potential risks by analyzing economic trends,
inflation rates, and personal financial data. They help to devise strategies to mitigate
these risks, be it through investments, insurance, or savings.
Investment Guidance: Based on long-term financial goals and market predictions,
LLMs provide guidance on where and how much to invest. This includes suggestions
on diversifying portfolios, adjusting asset allocations, and more.
Future Projections: One of the standout features of LLMs is their ability to project
financial futures based on current data and decisions. They offer a roadmap of where
one’s finances could be in 5, 10, or even 30 years from now.

Here is an example usage with more comprehensive data taking into account long-term

dependencies:

AI 2024, 5

108

LLM Long-Term Cooperative Financial Recommendation

Using the life-cycle model involves setting your saving and spending habits with a
long-term vision. Consumption smoothing is a key part of this, aiming to allocate
resources in a way that maintains a consistent standard of living throughout your
life. Here are my recommendations based on both your income and projected
life events:
1. **Start an Emergency Fund**: Save a portion of your combined income consis-
tently until you have about three to six months’ worth of living expenses. Con-
sidering your incomes and basic monthly expenses, which total $2150, I’d suggest
allocating at least $500/month for this initially.
2. **Create a Child Fund**: Since you’re planning to have a child in 3 years, cre-
ating a dedicated child fund should be a priority. It will help cover everything
from pregnancy-related medical costs to future schooling expenses. Let’s allocate
$300/month for this fund.
3. **Retirement Saving**: Member 2 is planning to retire in 20 years, so a substantial
part of the income should go towards retirement savings. If not already started, I
propose an immediate beginning with an initial tier of at least $600 a month.
4. **Income Adjustment**: The potential pay cut for Member 1 should be planned
for in advance. To facilitate consumption smoothing, consider increasing savings or
reducing non-essential expenses to accommodate the projected 10% pay cut.
5. **Housing Expenses**: Your total monthly rent is $1500. If you stay in the current
rental situation for the long term, there could be an opportunity to buy a house, as
long as it’s financially reasonable.
6. **Daily Living and Unexpected Expenses**: Allocate the rest of the income for
your daily living expenses and unexpected costs (car repairs, medical expenses, etc.).
In summary, this is a rough recommendation on which categories can the budget
be divided:

•
•
•
•
•
•

**Emergency Fund**: $500/month
**Child Fund**: $300/month
**Retirement Savings**: $600/month
**Housing**: $1,500/month
**Groceries**: $650/month
**Daily Living and Unexpected Costs**: The balance of your incomes after
removing the above expenses (approximately $2450).

This plan will require review and adjustment on a regular basis, at least yearly, to
accommodate changes in income or new financial needs/goals. Remember, the key
to the life-cycle model is flexibility and long-term planning.

As seen from our simulation framework, when LLMs like gpt-4-0613 are given a
long-term perspective, they provide advice that aligns with the core tenets of financial
planning. Whether it is individual or cooperative budgeting, the model’s recommendations
reflect an understanding of the intricate dance between current spending, future needs,
and long-term financial growth.

Analysis: The long-term cooperative financial recommendation exemplifies the model’s
capacity to engage with complex financial scenarios that span across an individual’s life-
time. Notably:

•

•

Consumption Smoothing: The model emphasizes consumption smoothing by suggest-
ing a consistent standard of living. Its advice on adjusting income to accommodate a
projected pay cut is particularly salient, as it showcases the model’s ability to suggest
proactive measures against potential financial setbacks.
Emergency and Specific Funds: The inclusion of both an emergency fund and a child
fund showcases the model’s comprehensive approach. It highlights an understanding

AI 2024, 5

109

•

of immediate needs (like emergencies) and future events (like planning for a child),
thus promoting financial preparedness.
Retirement Planning: The model’s advice to prioritize retirement savings for Member 2,
who plans to retire in 20 years, underscores its alignment with a long-term vision. It
demonstrates an acute awareness of the time-sensitive nature of retirement planning.

Overall, the model’s long-term cooperative financial recommendation reflects a good
understanding of the life-cycle model’s principles. It meticulously integrates immediate
financial needs with long-term goals, showcasing its potential to serve as a valuable tool in
the domain of financial planning.

7.5. Simulation of Financial Planning with LLM Recommendations

Going beyond, we present a simulation that integrates financial recommendations
from an LLM into the financial planning process of synthetic household datasets. Our
approach involves generating synthetic financial profiles for ten households, encompassing
monthly income and expenses across four categories: rent, groceries, utility bills, and
entertainment. The monthly incomes are normally distributed around a mean of USD
5000 with a standard deviation of USD 1000. Expenses in each category are also generated
following a normal distribution with category-specific means and variances.

Once the synthetic dataset is established, we employ an LLM to provide financial
planning advice for each household. The LLM is prompted to analyze the financial data and
recommend allocations as percentages of the household’s monthly income. The advice is
structured to include essential expenditures, savings, and discretionary spending, following
sound financial planning principles.

The LLM’s textual recommendations are parsed using regular expressions to extract
the suggested allocation percentages for each financial category. These extracted values are
then translated into monetary amounts based on the respective household’s income and
stored alongside the original data.

Subsequently, we apply a linear programming optimization model to each household’s
financial data, aiming to maximize savings while adhering to realistic constraints. This
model takes into account minimum spending requirements for each expense category,
ensuring that the optimized plan remains practical and sustainable.

Finally, we visualize the simulation results, comparing the original savings, LLM-
recommended savings, and optimized savings with bounds. This comparison highlights
the potential impact of AI-driven financial advice when combined with traditional opti-
mization techniques.

The instance of a financial planning scenario in Figure 2 not only showcases the
feasibility of utilizing AI in personal financial planning but also serves as a benchmark for
evaluating the LLM’s performance against traditional optimization models. The findings
suggest that LLMs can effectively contribute to financial decision making, offering insights
that align with recognized financial best practices.
The simulation involves several stages:

for each household, independent of LLM recommendations, using fixed minimum
spending bounds for each expense category.

Figure 2. Comparative analysis of household savings across three different financial planning
scenarios. The ’Original Savings’ bars represent the savings calculated from the synthetic dataset
without any optimization. The ’Optimized Savings with Bounds’ bars illustrate the savings after
applying a linear optimization model that maximizes savings while considering minimum essential
expenditures. The ’LLM Recommended Savings’ bars reflect the aggregate of savings categories as
suggested by the LLM, including emergency fund, retirement savings, and non-retirement savings.

In the process of developing our LLM financial recommender system, we mapped
the interactions between various components to ensure a seamless user experience and
robust performance. Figure 3 illustrates the sequence of events from the moment a user
inputs their financial data to the receipt of personalized recommendations and subsequent
budget optimization. This diagram delineates the system’s workflow, highlighting the role
of the LLM in analyzing financial data and generating tailored advice. The sequence further
demonstrates the integration of an optimization model that fine-tunes the initial recom-
mendations to accommodate user-specific financial goals and constraints. The interaction
between the user, LLM, and optimization model encapsulates the synergy of AI-driven
insights with algorithmic precision, which is central to the innovative approach of our
financial planning system.

The qualitative analysis in Table 1 distinctly showcases the advantages of our proposed
models over traditional financial planning methodologies. Key enhancements include the
capacity for high personalization, where the LLM’s inferential abilities tailor recommen-
dations to specific user scenarios. Unlike traditional models, our approach dynamically
adapts to market changes, leveraging the LLM’s capacity to analyze current data trends.
Scalability is another significant improvement: the AI-driven model can simultaneously
cater to a vast array of users, a feat challenging for traditional methods. In terms of user
accessibility, the proposed system simplifies complex financial concepts, making financial
planning more approachable for the general public. The integration of real-time data
ensures that the advice is always relevant and timely, a critical aspect often lacking in
conventional models. Finally, the proposed methodology excels in long-term financial
planning, with the ability to project and adapt to future financial scenarios, providing users
with a comprehensive view of their financial trajectory.

8. Conclusions and Future Work

The transition from traditional optimization approaches to the use of the extended
coevolutionary (EC) theory presents an innovative direction for the domain of financial
planning. By analyzing cooperative budgeting within households, this paper illuminates
the compatibility of game-theoretic models, adaptive learning, and the influential role of
large language models (LLMs) in shaping financial recommendations.

The provided pipeline exemplifies practical applications of the EC theory [27], demon-
strating a marriage between adaptive learning mechanisms and LLMs to generate financial
advisories, as an instantiation of a new economic theory where human decisions can be
greatly influenced by AI agents. Through iterative refinements influenced by LLM rec-
ommendations, the system iteratively approaches optimal financial allocations. The clear
distinction between individualized financial recommendations and cooperative household
budgeting reinforces the versatility of this approach, which could be seamlessly integrated
into household members by the use of a smartphone, smartwatch, or personal computer.

Future work may involve:

•

Expansion of Utility Functions: Future studies could delve deeper into constructing
more comprehensive utility functions, encompassing factors like changing financial
landscapes, inflation rates, and socio-economic considerations.

• Model Robustness: Analyzing the robustness of LLM recommendations in diverse
financial scenarios, especially under market volatility, would be beneficial. This
ensures the system’s resilience and adaptability to external shocks.
Integration with Real-time Data: By interfacing the proposed methodology with real-
time financial databases, the recommendations can be rendered even more timely and
relevant.

•

• Human-in-the-loop Mechanism: While LLMs are proficient, human expertise remains
indispensable. Incorporating a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where financial experts
refine or validate LLM recommendations, could elevate the system’s reliability.
Ethical Considerations: As with any AI-driven system, ethical considerations, espe-
cially in a domain as crucial as finance, are paramount. Future work must ensure that
the recommendations are unbiased, transparent, and in the best interest of the users.

•

Scalability to Larger Cooperative Entities: While households were the primary focus,
scaling the model to address cooperative budgeting for larger entities, like community
groups or small businesses, could be a natural progression.

In essence, the integration of the EC framework into financial planning is but the
tip of the iceberg. The potential applications and refinements are vast, opening avenues
for research and practical implementations that can significantly enhance the quality of
financial advisories and decision-making processes.

Analysing community-level
spending behaviour contributing
to high carbon emissions using
stochastic block models

Ognyan Simeonov1,2, Valerio Restocchi1 & Benjamin D. Goddard2

Large financial transaction datasets are increasingly used to estimate carbon emissions associated
with individual spending. However, to effectively target high-emission spending areas and implement
successful carbon reduction strategies, policymakers and financial institutions need to understand
individual consumer spending behaviour. In this study, we describe an approach to identify spending
patterns in large financial transaction datasets, using stochastic block modelling for community
detection on a bipartite network. This is an effective method to form communities of consumers who
share similar spending patterns across merchant categories, allowing us to identify the categories
causing high carbon emissions for each group of consumers. We also introduce a modification to the
weights of the bipartite network which allows us to keep the average community spending constant
across different categories. The impact and applications of this study are twofold. First, it highlights
the importance of transaction datasets and stochastic block modelling in providing insights for
financial institutions in their efforts to decarbonise by identifying areas for targeted behavioural
strategies for carbon reduction. Second, it provides researchers with a framework to examine how
different factors, such as consumer spending patterns, energy usage, or transportation habits,
interact with one another. This is done while keeping overall spending levels consistent across various
communities, allowing for a controlled analysis of behavioural and economic impacts on carbon
reduction efforts.

Reducing  carbon  emissions  has  recently  become  one  of  the  primary  goals  of  policymakers  and  institutions
around the globe. Countries in the Carbon Neutrality Coalition are currently in the process of building and
implementing plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with one of the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals highlighting the importance of a sustainable and resilient future1.

In an effort to track emissions associated with individual expenditure, financial and government institutions
have developed carbon calculators to inform consumers about their daily emissions2–5. While the methodology
behind most of the company-specific carbon calculators is proprietary information and not accessible to the
general  public,  Trendl  et  al.6  recently  published  a  widely  accessible  open  approach  for  calculating  carbon
emissions  from  micro-level  transaction  data. The  authors  develop  category-specific  carbon  multipliers  based
on  data  from  the  UK  Living  Cost  and  Food  Expenditure  (LCFS)  survey  and  the  UK  Multi-Region  Input-
Output  (UKMRIO)  greenhouse  gas  emission  values.  They  show  that  financial  transactions  present  a  reliable
alternative to traditional survey-based methods for carbon emissions tracking and published statistics from their
transaction dataset, making the study a good benchmark for comparison.

Identifying consumer groups with similar spending and associated carbon emissions patterns is crucial for
designing effective interventions that encourage sustainable consumption. These insights can inform policies at
both governmental and industry levels. Policymakers can use this information to develop targeted sustainability
initiatives, such as tax incentives or subsidies for low-carbon purchases, while financial institutions and businesses
can design personalised incentives to reduce carbon emissions based on consumer profiles7,8. However, there
remains an open challenge in understanding how such consumption patterns can be used to inform the design
of effective, group-level carbon reduction behavioural interventions.

Since financial institutions and governments work with datasets covering millions of consumers, tracking
spending behaviour on an individual level and tailoring interventions to each consumer is highly impractical.
Instead,  the  ability  to  identify  large  consumer  groups  with  shared  spending  habits  and  emissions  profiles  is
essential  for  the  scalable  implementation  of  behavioural  incentives  that  promote  sustainable  spending.  To
achieve this, clustering algorithms can be used to systematically group consumers based on their transaction
data, facilitating the design of targeted and scalable interventions that align with the shared characteristics of
these groups.

Related work and our contribution
Several studies have examined the role of clustering algorithms in uncovering groups of consumers with similar
habits. Traditional clustering methods have been widely used to segment consumers based on their spending
behaviours.

For instance, de Vries, Carlson & Moscato9 introduced a clustering approach based on a Minimum-Spanning-
Tree  and  k-Nearest  Neighbour  (MST-kNN)  graph,  successfully  segmenting  online  consumer  behaviour  into
five distinct groups, each associated with unique engagement patterns. Sgroi et al.10 applied a cluster analysis
approach to study consumer trends in functional foods, showing that demographic factors such as age, gender,
and income play significant roles in shaping spending behaviour. Additionally, Chang, Hung & Ho11 proposed
an anticipation model combining clustering analysis with association rule mining to predict potential customers’
purchasing behaviours based on their interactions with web platforms.

Financial  transaction  data  has  also  been  widely  used  to  study  consumer  spending  patterns.  Di  Clemente
et  al.12  investigated  the  sequential  nature  of  consumer  transactions,  finding  that  purchase  sequences  of
Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) follow a Zipf-like distribution and can be used to cluster consumers into
groups with similar socio-economic characteristics. Dong et al.13 explored how work and home environments
shape purchasing behaviours, showing that spending habits are influenced by social structures and geographic
proximity. More recently, Bahrami et al.14 leveraged machine learning techniques to predict customer spending
behaviour based on transaction histories, demonstrating the predictive power of financial transaction networks.
Clustering techniques have been employed to identify consumer groups with environmental considerations.
For example, Jansson, Marell & Nordlund15 performed a cluster analysis on Swedish car owners and identified
three  distinct  consumer  segments  based  on  their  pro-environmental  purchasing  behaviours.  However,
most  studies  in  this  area  focus  on  a  singular  type  of  purchasing  behaviour—such  as  car  ownership,  energy
consumption16,  or  organic  food  purchases17—without  accounting  for  broader  spending  patterns.  Moreover,
these studies often rely on survey data or self-reported behaviours, which may not accurately reflect real-world
spending. In contrast, we work with transaction datasets, providing a more comprehensive and objective view
of consumer spending habits across multiple categories. This allows us to capture interactions between different
types of purchases, offering a more holistic understanding of sustainable consumption.

Recent work by Wells et al.18 has shown the potential of using financial transaction data to segment households
based  on  carbon  footprints.  This  study  uses  k-means  clustering  on  over  700,000  customers,  incorporating
socioeconomic  indicators  along  with  emissions  by  categories  to  identify  household  typologies  for  targeted
retrofit interventions. While this study represents a significant step forward, the approach focuses on overall
customer segmentation and relies on demographic attributes and distance-based clustering.

In contrast, our study focuses on a sustainability-oriented subset of the population, analysing their spending
behaviour and proposing a complementary approach that clusters customers solely based on their transaction
patterns  across  categories,  without  relying  on  socio-demographic  data.  Including  such  demographic  or
geographic variables as features during clustering can inadvertently reinforce pre-existing societal structures or
inequalities, leading to clusters that may reflect known groupings. Instead, we apply a Stochastic Block Model
(SBM) community detection method on a bipartite network of customers and merchant categories, where edges
represent the proportion of spending and associated carbon emissions.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to apply SBM to financial transaction data in the
context of sustainability. Unlike traditional clustering techniques, SBM identifies communities based on network
structure rather than predefined attributes, mitigating potential biases related to demographics or geography.
Moreover, SBM has been shown to be particularly effective at uncovering statistically significant latent structures
in behavioural networks, as it models the generative process of link formation directly rather than relying on
distance-based heuristics19. Along with its probabilistic foundation, high resolution limits, and ability to capture
hierarchical  cluster  structures,  SBM  is  particularly  well-suited  for  identifying  meaningful  communities  in
behavioural networks.

This  approach  groups  consumers  with  similar  overall  emission  profiles,  rather  than  focusing  on  a  single
category in isolation. By doing so, we can identify consumer segments that contribute to carbon emissions in
comparable ways and develop targeted interventions to encourage sustainable spending habits. This network-
based methodology provides a more comprehensive understanding of consumer behaviour, allowing for more
effective policy design and personalised strategies to reduce emissions at scale.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section “Data and methods”, we explain the financial and
government datasets used for this study. We also describe the bipartite network creation method and the SBM
approach used to identify groups of customers with similar spending behaviour. In section “Results”, we present
results of the community detection algorithm and analyze the effects of modifications to the edge weights and
category groupings. Section “Discussion” provides a comparison of our results to the literature and discusses the
importance and limitations of our study. Section “Conclusion” presents our conclusions.

Data and methods
We  obtain  financial  transaction  data  from  ekko20,  a  sustainable  banking  FinTech  company,  alongside  several
government datasets. These include the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)21 , Living Cost and Food Survey
(LCFS)22,  and  UK  Multi-Region  Input-Output  (UKMRIO)  data23.  These  datasets  provide  socio-economic
context and environmental impact metrics for the customers of the banking initiative. In this section, we describe
the dataset and also outline the network construction approach and community detection methodology, aimed
at uncovering patterns in consumer behaviour and carbon emissions associated with everyday spending. The
code used to apply the methodology for this research is freely available 24.

Financial transaction dataset
We obtained a debit card transaction dataset from ekko20, a sustainable banking FinTech we partnered with,
containing tens of thousands of transactions spanning from 2021 to 2023 from 1,362 customers based in the
UK.  A  distinctive  feature  of  these  customers  is  their  higher  level  of  environmental  consciousness  compared
to the general population. This is demonstrated by their engagement with ekko, which focuses on promoting
environmentally  friendly  practices  and  rewards  customers  for  their  transaction  activity.  These  rewards  are
specifically  designed  to  help  customers  consider  the  carbon  footprint  of  their  everyday  transactions.  The
FinTech’s mobile application allows customers to view in real-time the environmental impact of their spending,
along with personalized insights and streamlined features that make it easier to adopt greener choices in their
daily lives.

The  financial  transaction  dataset  includes  key  customer  metrics  such  as  customer  ID,  postcode,  age,  and
transaction  details  including  transaction  time,  Merchant  Category  Code  (MCC),  and  amount  spent.  We
summarize the age and IMD distributions of the customers and discuss how they compare to national levels in
Appendix 1.

The spending categories of customers in our analysis are defined by the Merchant Category Codes (MCCs)
assigned by the debit card provider, in this case, Mastercard. Each transaction is linked to a merchant category,
described by spending type. An extensive list of merchant categories and the transactions that fall within each is
available in Mastercard’s reference documentation25.

However, it is important to note that some spending categories are incompletely represented in the dataset
due to the nature of the available transaction data. In particular, utility payments are frequently made via direct
debit, which is not included in this dataset. As a result, spending in the MCC 4900 category (“Utilities—Electric,
Gas,  Heating  Oil,  Sanitary,  Water”)  is  less  than  expected.  Other  services  commonly  paid  via  direct  debit,
such as subscriptions (MCC 4899—“Cable, Satellite, and Other Pay Television and Radio Services”) and rent
payments (MCC 6513—“Real Estate Agents and Managers—Rentals”), are also underrepresented in this data.
This limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting the absence of energy-related or subscription-based
spending and emissions in the figures and cluster analysis.

For the Stochastic Block Modelling (SBM) analysis, we focus on customers who have made a minimum of 30
transactions across 10 distinct categories to ensure we capture consistent and diverse everyday spending patterns.
This threshold is set to include only those customers with a sufficiently broad spending behaviour, preventing the
inclusion of infrequent or niche spenders that could skew the analysis. With this criterion, we retain a sample
of 272 customers, ensuring statistical significance. In Fig. 1 we present the percentage of spending behaviour
across MCCs of this sample. To further validate our approach, we apply the model to larger, artificially generated
transaction datasets in subsection Applying the model on larger dataset. The results show that although the set of
customers may vary with different minimum thresholds for transactions and MCCs, the use of stochastic block
modelling still yields clusters with consistent underlying patterns (see subsection Applying the model on larger
dataset for more details). The choice of thresholds does not fundamentally alter the overall structure uncovered
by the analysis, but it does change the specific composition of the clusters based on the number of customers we
allow for.

Government datasets: IMD, LCFS, and UKMRIO
This study relies on several openly available government datasets to contextualise spending patterns and their
associated carbon emissions within broader socio-economic and environmental contexts. The datasets used are
the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), the Living Cost and Food Survey (LCFS), and the UK Multi-Region
Input-Output (UKMRIO) data.

The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) provides a detailed measure of deprivation at a small area level
across England, covering indicators such as income, employment, education, health, crime, housing, and the
living environment. We use the English indices of deprivation 2019 dataset, published by the UK Ministry of
Housing,  Communities  &  Local  Government21,  to  understand  the  socio-economic  profile  of  customers  and
analyse correlations between deprivation levels and spending behaviour.

The  Living  Cost  and  Food  Survey  (LCFS),  collected  annually  by  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  (ONS),
provides  detailed  data  on  household  expenditure,  income,  and  demographics.  The  UK  Multi-Region  Input-
Output (UKMRIO) dataset offers a model of the flow of goods and services across UK regions, detailing inter-
industry interactions, consumption, and environmental impacts. Together, these datasets allow us to estimate
the carbon emissions linked to different categories of expenditure6.

Data integration and fusion
To integrate the financial transaction data with these government datasets, we follow a structured process. First,
carbon emissions for each transaction are estimated using the third approach described in Trendl et al.6, which
derives emissions from financial transaction data combined with MRIO-based carbon multipliers. Specifically,
we apply carbon intensity multipliers developed by Trendl et al.6, based on the LCFS and UKMRIO datasets.

Fig. 1.  Percentage of transactions in the top 10 most frequent Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) across the
entire sample (N = 272 customers).

These multipliers are linked to COICOP categories, which are then mapped to MCCs in the transaction data
using established mappings2,26–28. This approach allows us to estimate emissions for each transaction based on its
MCC and spending amount, with adjustments for inflation using Consumer Price Index (CPI) values.

Second,  the  IMD  is  linked  to  the  transaction  data  using  customer  postcodes,  matching  each  postcode  to
a  Lower  Layer  Super  Output  Area  (LSOA)  in  the  IMD  dataset.  This  provides  deprivation  statistics  for  each
customer, enabling an analysis of socio-economic influences on spending behaviour and carbon emissions. We
managed to map every customer to the respective level of deprivation of their environment.

By  combining  these  datasets,  we  ensure  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  customer  spending  patterns,  socio-

economic contexts, and associated carbon emissions.

Bipartite network creation
Bipartite networks are used to represent systems consisting of two distinct types of nodes. In simple bipartite
networks,  connections  only  form  between  nodes  of  different  types,  which  makes  them  ideal  for  modelling
relationships  in  complex  datasets.  For  example,  in  ecology,  bipartite  networks  can  illustrate  interactions
between species and their environments, helping researchers understand ecosystem dynamics29,30. Similarly, in
recommendation systems, these networks can connect users with items, allowing for tailored recommendations
based  on  user  preferences31.  In  economics,  bipartite  networks  can  represent  relationships  between  different
economic agents, such as consumers and products, facilitating insights into market behaviour32.

By  highlighting  these  applications,  we  can  see  that  bipartite  networks  are  not  just  theoretical  constructs;
they  are  a  practical  tool  that  helps  us  analyse  and  understand  complex  interactions  between  distinct  groups
across various fields. They can be used for data mining, pattern recognition, and identifying relationships within
complex systems, making them useful in both research and applied contexts. In the context of this research, their
role  extends  to  identifying  consumer  spending  patterns  and  estimating  carbon  emissions,  thereby  providing
valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions seeking to implement effective carbon reduction
strategies. In this research context, these networks allow customers to be linked with the transaction categories
they engage with.

To understand customer spending behaviour, we construct a bipartite network with customers as one type
of node and MCCs as the other. An edge is created between a customer and an MCC if the customer has made
a transaction in that category. See Fig. 2 for an illustration of this bipartite network structure. This approach
allows us to present all the data from a large transaction dataset in a single network, connecting customers and
categories based on transaction patterns. We can then apply network analysis techniques to analyse the dataset,
which provides additional insights compared to classical statistics and machine learning approaches.

This network approach also accommodates classification systems different from the MCC used by financial
institutions,  allowing  for  the  exploration  of  connections  and  the  identification  of  consumer  communities
based on their spending patterns. By incorporating various classifications, such as COICOP used by the UN
and multiple policymaking institutions, this approach provides broad analysis of consumer behaviour across
different contexts.

Fig. 2.  An example of a transaction bipartite network, showing the connection between customers (top) and
MCCs (bottom). Each edge represents that the customer has had at least one transaction in that merchant
category.

Additionally, we define two alternative edge-weighting schemes for the bipartite network to better capture
different characteristics of the data. These weight assignments provide different ways to quantify the strength
of the relationship between customers and merchant categories (MCCs) based on their transaction behaviour.

First, we use the number of transactions between a customer and an MCC as the edge weight. This means
that for each customer-category connection, the weight is simply the count of transactions made by that specific
customer in that category. This approach ensures that the network structure reflects not only the set of categories
a customer transacts in but also the frequency of transactions within each category. By incorporating transaction
counts directly as weights, we preserve the raw behavioural patterns without introducing external assumptions.
Second, we define an alternative weighting based on relative spending per category. Here, the edge weight
represents the total amount a customer has spent in a given category, normalised by the average spending of all
customers in that category. This normalisation ensures that spending behaviour is interpreted in the context of
overall category trends, allowing us to identify customers who spend significantly more or less than average in
a given category.

These  weighting  schemes  do  not  introduce  arbitrary  modifications  but  rather  directly  derive  from
the  transaction  data  itself–either  as  transaction  counts  or  spending  amounts–ensuring  a  transparent  and
interpretable network representation. By applying network analysis to these weighted structures, we uncover
different  aspects  of  consumer  spending  behaviour.  The  results  of  these  analyses  and  their  implications  are
explored in the Discussion section.

Stochastic block modelling
A Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a probabilistic model used to analyse the structure of networks by dividing
nodes into distinct groups or “blocks” based on connection patterns. Its probabilistic nature makes it well-suited
for community detection, allowing us to identify connection patterns within and between groups. Introduced
in the 1980s by33, the canonical SBM views networks as structures composed of blocks of nodes. Connections
between nodes are determined by their block memberships and predefined network parameters.

There  have  been  many  recent  advancements  in  SBMs  expanding  their  applicability  to  various  networks
across different scientific fields. Modifications to the canonical SBM structure include approaches that account
for  weights  in  networks34  and  hierarchical  communities35.  Studies  have  also  developed  degree-corrected
variations36 and overlapping communities37.

These models have been effectively applied to study community formation in various fields, such as in US
Senate  political  cohesion  and  co-voting  networks38,  connections  in  healthy  human  gut  microbiomes39,  and
relationships in ecology and ethnobiology40.

SBMs are particularly useful for analysing large-scale networks encountered in real-world applications, such
as large financial transaction datasets. While our study focuses on UK consumption data, this approach is not
limited to a single region. SBMs can be applied to transaction datasets from other countries, enabling cross-
country comparisons of consumer behaviour and spending patterns by identifying similarities and differences
in community structures across regions. Their high resolution limits allow for the identification of numerous
communities  with  specific  characteristics35,41.  The  probabilistic  basis  of  SBMs  ensures  reliable  community
detection results based on observed data, making them an efficient tool for revealing insights into community
organization in complex networks.

In contrast to methods like k-means or modularity maximisation, which may struggle with high-dimensional,
sparse, or complex network data, SBMs are better suited for detecting meaningful community structures. SBMs
identify statistically significant assortative modules by modelling the full probabilistic structure of the network,
enabling them to avoid common pitfalls like resolution limits and overfitting35,42. Moreover, SBM’s hierarchical
and  nonparametric  properties  allow  the  detection  of  multi-scale  community  structures  and  fine-grained
behavioural patterns without prior assumptions about the number or shape of the clusters19. This makes them
particularly appropriate for analysing behavioural networks derived from financial transactions.

In  this  study,  we  apply  a  degree-corrected  nonparametric  hierarchical  SBM  on  the  bipartite  network  we
previously described to identify communities of customers based on spending categories. We implement the

model using Python and the graph-tool package. For reproducibility, the full code is openly available24. This
specific SBM method was initially developed for topic modelling through word clusters in documents43,44. We
apply this method to financial transaction datasets so that we can find communities of customers with similar
spending behaviour in bipartite networks of customers and categories. Additionally, we introduce modifications
to the code, so that we can use any arbitrary vector of weights between the customer and category nodes instead
of solely relying on the number of repeated transactions as the weight.

However, due to its probabilistic nature, running the SBM algorithm only once does not guarantee finding
the  optimal  partition  consistently19.  To  address  this  variability,  we  run  the  algorithm  100  times,  as  this  is
typically sufficient for the entropy in the system to stabilise—meaning that the uncertainty in the community
assignments reaches a consistent level. Stabilisation of entropy is desirable because it indicates that the algorithm
has converged to a reliable partitioning of the network. However, we can run additional iterations if necessary.
We then plot the change in entropy and select the iteration with the highest posterior probability. We choose the
clusters generated by the SBM which are optimal because they achieve the lowest possible entropy, indicating a
well-defined community structure.

 Results
In this section, we present the findings from the SBM community detection applied to the bipartite network. We
show how these communities vary based on the weights assigned within the network, providing insights into
distinct patterns of consumer behaviour and their corresponding environmental impacts.

SBM community detection results
Applying  the  Stochastic  Block  Model  (SBM)  community  detection  to  the  bipartite  network  identifies  clear
groupings of customers based on their transaction patterns across specific merchant categories (see Fig. 3). These
communities reflect clusters of customers who consistently engage with similar types of merchants, indicating
shared spending behaviours and preferences.

We analysed the distribution of customer transactions within each community across all MCC categories.
The  results  show  that  the  transaction  counts  of  customers  within  the  same  community  are  tightly  clustered
around the mean for each MCC, with minimal variation, as indicated by standard deviations close to zero. This
statistical consistency in spending patterns suggests that customers in each community exhibit homogeneous
behaviours. The uniformity across communities is supported by the low variance, providing clear evidence of
distinct customer segmentation based on transactional behaviour.

The nested structure of the SBM we apply reveals hierarchical community structures based on consumer
spending behaviours. This method allows for the identification of communities at various levels, beginning with
the most granular communities at level 0, which are then aggregated into larger communities at higher levels.
Within each higher-level community shown in the network, the nested SBM identifies sub-communities that
share more specific spending habits. This relationship is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the different colours represent
distinct  communities  and  the  blue  graph  overlay  highlights  the  hierarchical  nature  of  these  communities,
demonstrating how lower-level spending patterns contribute to the formation of broader groupings.

customer nodes on the right and merchant nodes on the left. Edges connect customers to specific transaction
categories, and colours indicate different communities. The blue graph overlay shows hierarchical community
formation, combining lower-level communities into larger groups, allowing analysis at varying levels of
granularity.

In this analysis, we focus on communities formed at level 1. This choice allows for a balanced understanding
of customer behaviour, as level 1 communities in the case of this dataset capture significant spending patterns
without becoming overly granular. Larger datasets may benefit from targeting lower-level clusters to limit the
number of customers per community, while smaller datasets might be better suited for higher-level community
analysis, focusing on broader groups of customers simultaneously. This flexibility helps ensure that we derive
meaningful insights from the data at the appropriate level of detail.

We  analyse  cluster  attributes  and  find  that  certain  merchant  categories  contribute  disproportionately  to
the  overall  carbon  emissions  of  each  customer  community.  Specifically,  we  examine  the  percentage  of  total
community emissions contributed by each category, as well as total spending and the number of transactions
per  category.  For  example,  Fig.  4  shows  the  distribution  of  carbon  emissions  across  merchant  categories,
highlighting  the  categories  with  the  highest  carbon  footprint  in  each  community.  While  certain  clusters  are
driven by a dominant category in terms of emissions, others exhibit a more balanced distribution across several
categories. Therefore, we report the emission shares of the top 10 highest-emitting categories in each cluster to
offer a more complete picture of the emission profiles and enable comparison across different types of consumer
behaviour. This analysis reveals the significant environmental impact of specific spending behaviours within the
customer clusters.

The grocery stores category remains prominent in carbon emissions across most clusters because it is the most
frequently visited category. However, Fig. 4 highlights that cluster 22 has a disproportionately high emissions
tied to grocery spending, as customers in this cluster primarily use their cards for grocery purchases. Clusters
17 and 18 show elevated emissions linked to taxi usage, suggesting a heavier reliance on this mode of transport.
Clusters 3, 11, and 12 exhibit significant emissions from service stations, indicating higher fuel consumption,
while cluster 20 shows high emissions associated with public transport, reflecting the transportation preferences
of consumers in that community.

These patterns may stem from two main factors. First, they likely reflect genuine spending behaviour, where
customers naturally concentrate spending in categories relevant to their lifestyle, as with commuters in Cluster
20. Second, it may be influenced by how customers choose to use their ekko debit card, as incentives are based
on transaction counts rather than amounts, leading some customers to use the card selectively for smaller or
specific  purchases  while  using  other  payment  methods  elsewhere.  The  observed  clusters  probably  reflect  a
combination of these factors.

From a practical perspective, for customers near the minimum threshold of category diversity (i.e. 10 MCCs),
ekko could introduce tools to encourage broader card use, such as rewards for diversifying spending or increasing
transaction amounts in less-used categories. However, many clusters would capture authentic spending patterns,
highlighting  segments  where  targeted  sustainability  nudges  and  personalised  communication  focusing  on
dominant emission-driving categories can be particularly impactful.

By interpreting these clusters, we identify distinct consumer behaviours that contribute to varying levels of
carbon emissions. For instance, certain clusters show a higher concentration of transactions in high-emission
categories, such as gas station services and transport, which directly correlates with higher carbon footprints.
Additionally,  in  Appendix  2,  we  provide  the  distribution  of  spending  and  the  number  of  transactions  across

Fig. 4.  Heatmap with the percentage of carbon emissions per merchant category across customer clusters,
showing the merchant categories that cause the highest and lowest emission levels for each cluster.

categories, further highlighting the spending patterns driving these emissions. This detailed breakdown reveals
which consumer behaviours contribute most significantly to overall carbon output.

Weighted SBM results
In our analysis, we incorporate two types of edge weights to enhance the representation of customer behaviour
in the bipartite network. The first type is based on the number of transactions between customers and MCCs,
capturing the frequency of customer engagement with different categories. The second type reflects the relative
amount spent by customers in each category compared to the average customer, helping us identify spending
patterns and their potential environmental impact.

When incorporating the number of transactions as a weight, the resulting clusters exhibit varying carbon
emissions across different categories. This highlights how transaction frequency influences emissions, providing
insights  into  which  categories  contribute  most  significantly  to  a  customer’s  carbon  footprint.  For  example,
frequent  transactions  in  high-emission  categories  may  indicate  opportunities  for  targeted  interventions  to
promote sustainable alternatives.

When  using  spending  amounts  as  weights,  the  SBM  identifies  clusters  with  consistent  spending  patterns
across categories. These clusters reveal that customers within each group allocate on average similar proportions
of  their  spending  to  different  categories.  As  a  result,  the  clusters  themselves  exhibit  similar  overall  emission
profiles, since the carbon intensity of each category is consistent across clusters. However, individual customers
within a cluster may still have varying emission profiles due to differences in absolute spending levels or specific
purchasing habits within a category.

To ensure spending and emission behaviours are comparable across categories, we normalise each transaction
by dividing the amount spent by the average spending in that category. This allows for a more accurate comparison
of customer behaviour and associated carbon emissions across categories with different average expenditures.

We  visualise  the  spending  patterns  across  different  merchant  categories  using  a  heatmap  (Fig.  5).  The
first two columns of the heatmap represent the customer percentage spending per community across various
merchant categories, while the third column displays the average customer spending (population spending) for
each category. The community spending is approximately equal across all 10 categories and closely aligns with
the population values for each category. Since carbon emissions are derived using category-specific multipliers,
equal spending across categories leads to similar emission profiles for each cluster, highlighting the relationship
between spending patterns and environmental impact.

To show the consistency and central tendency across different customer groups, we examine if the cluster
spending  values  are  within  one  Median  Absolute  Deviation  (MAD)  of  the  median  in  the  distributions  of
customer spending per category. The MAD is defined as the median of the absolute deviations from the median
of the data set:

where Xi represents individual data points. We use the median in this study as a measure of central tendency,
as it is useful when dealing with outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values, unlike the mean. We
typically  observe  a  few  outliers  in  most  categories,  as  some  customers  concentrate  their  debit  card  usage  on
specific merchant categories, which skews the data.

When most values fall within one MAD of the median, it indicates that the data points are tightly clustered
around the central value, demonstrating high consistency. However, as one MAD may seem an arbitrary choice,
we also consider thresholds of 0.5 MAD to evaluate the similarity in cluster spending patterns further. In this
context, a value close to the median implies that the clusters of customers exhibit similar spending habits, closely
aligned with the population values.

We  construct  distributions  of  the  percentage  of  total  customer  spending  per  category  for  all  merchant
categories and calculate the median and MAD for each distribution. One such distribution for Grocery Stores
and Supermarkets is shown in Fig. 6. This represents a typical distribution observed across the categories. We
include the median and MAD values for the ten most common spending categories in columns four and five of
Fig. 5.

The spending percentages in the clusters across the ten most common categories are all within one MAD of
the median, and 71 out of 80 clusters in categories with at least 30 customers fall within one MAD of the median.
Moreover, we observe that approximately 3/4 of the clusters across the ten most common categories fall within
half MAD of the median and 43 out of the 80 categories with at least 30 customers are also within half a MAD
of the median. In comparison, when we apply this median-MAD analysis to the unweighted SBM communities,
we find that fewer than half of the clusters fall within one MAD of the median and only about 1/5 of the clusters
fall within half a MAD.

This  indicates  that  the  weighted  SBM  effectively  identifies  customer  groups  with  consistent  spending
patterns,  enabling  targeted  interventions  to  reduce  emissions.  For  example,  clusters  with  high  spending
proportions in high-emission categories could be prioritised for initiatives promoting sustainable alternatives,
such as public transport incentives or renewable energy solutions. By focusing on both spending behaviour and
emission intensity, this approach provides a robust framework for designing policies that encourage sustainable
consumption at scale.

Applying the model on larger datasets
Financial  institutions  and  policymakers  frequently  deal  with  much  larger  datasets  than  the  one  used  in  our
initial study. To evaluate the scalability and applicability of our approach, we generated an artificial larger dataset
consisting of one million transactions and 3,000 customers that mirrors the distributions found in the original
data. This synthetic dataset replicates key characteristics, including the number of transactions per customer,
the distribution of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) across transactions, the amount spent per MCC, and the
corresponding emissions.

To simulate this dataset, we fit the parameters for probability density functions to the real data distributions
for the number of transactions per customer, the distribution of MCCs across transactions, the amount spent
per MCC, and we calculate the corresponding carbon emissions. We introduce joint distributions for correlated
variables, such as spending amount and transaction frequency, to ensure that the relationships between these
variables are accurately represented. After creating the specified number of artificial customer IDs, we draw values
from the estimated probability density functions, ensuring that the generated dataset follows the distribution of
the original data. We perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to validate the accuracy of the synthetic dataset,
which confirms that the generated distributions are closely aligned with the real ones.

When applying the SBM methodology to this larger dataset, we observe that the unweighted SBM continues
to effectively identify clusters of customers with similar spending behaviours. However, in the context of larger
transaction datasets, it may be more useful for financial institutions to focus on communities identified at the

lower levels of the hierarchical SBM, which are more granular. These lower-level communities tend to contain
a greater number of customers in cases of larger datasets, making them more relevant for large-scale analyses.

In the weighted case, applying SBM to the larger dataset identifies more communities. These communities

maintain the pattern of equal percentage spending across MCCs observed in the original dataset.

In summary, our findings indicate that the methods used in this study are scalable and applicable to larger
datasets,  providing  valuable  insights  for  financial  institutions  and  policymakers  interested  in  analysing  and
mitigating the environmental impact of consumer spending. The analysis of smaller datasets (fewer than one
million  transactions)  typically  completes  in  seconds,  while  analyses  of  larger  datasets  with  several  million
transactions, may take a few minutes or hours.

 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach, we compare our results to current
literature, and highlight the ethical implications of developing spending behavioural incentives.

The results of our analysis can be used to identify customers with similar spending and carbon emissions

patterns and to form communities with similar spending across merchant categories.

While the SBM does not take into account the socio-economic status of the customers when creating the
communities, we show in Appendix 1 that these metrics are also important to consider. Therefore, we also briefly
discuss the role of socio-economic metrics for behaviour interventions on a wider policy scale as well as on an
individual business level.

SBM community formation
The  use  of  stochastic  block  modelling  in  our  analysis  helps  mitigate  bias  by  clustering  customers  based  on
network properties rather than demographic or socio-economic factors. The SBM identifies patterns in the data
by examining the connections between customers and business categories, allowing for an unbiased grouping
of customers with similar spending behaviours. This method ensures that the identified communities are based
on actual transaction patterns, reducing the risk of reinforcing existing biases related to age, income, or other
personal characteristics.

Using  the  results  to  target  different  groups  of  customers  rather  than  individual  customers  is  particularly
advantageous when dealing with large datasets. By identifying distinct communities through SBM community
detection,  organisations  can  develop  and  implement  group-specific  strategies,  optimising  resource  allocation
and increasing the effectiveness of interventions. This approach is especially helpful in sustainable banking, as it
allows banks to promote green financial products and services more effectively by targeting clusters of customers
with similar spending habits, thus driving collective behaviour change towards sustainability. Additionally, it can
be applied in marketing and customer relationship management, where tailored communication and incentives
can be designed for each identified group, leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.

The  SBM  algorithm  offers  significant  advantages  as  compared  to  other  community  detection  algorithms,
particularly in the context of detecting community structures within large and complex networks34,41,45. Unlike
traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means or mean shift clustering, which may struggle with the high-
dimensional and sparse data, the SBM algorithm excels in these contexts by applying a probabilistic approach to
identify clusters38,42,46. This allows the SBM to capture more detailed patterns and relationships between nodes,
even in cases where other methods might fail to reveal meaningful groupings.

Communities identified through the SBM community detection offer valuable insights into how to target
customers with similar carbon emissions patterns. By clustering customers based on their spending behaviours
across  different  merchant  categories,  we  can  identify  distinct  groups  that  exhibit  homogeneous  emissions
profiles, as indicated in Fig. 4. Then, for each community, we can analyse whether to develop incentives that
target amount spent per transaction, number of transactions, or both.

For example, Fig. 7 shows the percent of cluster emissions for the Taxicabs and Limousines category and the
respective cluster values for spending and amount of transactions in that category. Policymakers and financial
institutions can identify groups of customers for whom spending in Taxicabs and Limousines causes highest
share of emissions (clusters 17 and 18 in this case). Then, they can examine whether to target the number of
transactions of that cluster (appropriate for cluster 17), amount of spending per transaction, or both (appropriate
for cluster 18).

In  behavioural  science  and  economics,  clustering  customers  based  on  consistent  spending  patterns  while
keeping other factors constant (ceteris paribus) is vital for understanding consumer behaviour. The weighted SBM
allows for maintaining consistent spending across groups, enabling the analysis of the interaction of geographic,
cultural, demographic, and socio-economic factors. This approach helps isolate these factors’ effects. For instance,
in a multicountry study, researchers can compare consumer preferences based on geographic location or cultural
background,  eliminating  the  impact  of  varying  spending  behaviours.  While  the  unweighted  SBM  identifies
groups with similar spending patterns, applying total spending as an edge weight results in communities with
spending patterns comparable to each other and the broader population. As demonstrated by the median and
MAD analysis in Fig. 5, the weighted SBM effectively splits the customer dataset into communities with equal
percentages spent per merchant category, aiding our understanding of consumer behaviour.

There  are  other  studies  that  focus  on  analysing  consumer  behaviour  through  various  methodologies,
such  as  non-probabilistic  clustering  algorithms  (k-means,  hierarchical  clustering,  and  partitioning  around
medoids)47,48,  convolutional  neural  networks49,  and  association  rule  mining  algorithms50.  A  convolutional
neural network classifier uses visual representations of transaction histories, treating each transaction as a visual
input that is processed through convolutional layers to extract features. This approach is primarily suited for
tasks  where  spatial  relationships  within  data  (such  as  images)  are  crucial  for  classification  or  prediction.  In

contrast, our approach with the SBM community detection operates on the probabilistic dependencies inherent
in transactional data.

Similarly,  association  rule  mining  focuses  on  discovering  frequent  itemsets  and  association  rules,  which
may  overlook  the  hierarchical  relationships  present  in  customer  spending  patterns  that  the  SBM  captures.
Our  research  contributes  to  the  existing  literature  by  introducing  a  novel  application  of  the  stochastic  block
model  to  analyse  consumer  behaviour  based  on  transactional  data  across  multiple  merchant  categories.  The
SBM complements existing methodologies based on clustering algorithms because it operates on probabilistic
principles derived directly from the data and has a much higher resolution limit for community detection.

Additionally,  unlike  other  studies,  we  propose  a  method  for  preserving  spending  patterns  across  clusters
of  customers  through  the  weighted  SBM.  The  network  construction  can  also  be  further  adapted  based  on
different  needs.  For  example,  constructing  the  network  using  COICOP  categories  instead  of  MCCs  yields
similar community structures based on broader economic expenditure classifications. This approach aligns with
international economic classification and provides insights into consumer spending behaviours applicable for
policy-making analysis.

However, the SBM approach has some notable limitations, including its static nature, computational expense,
and increased difficulty in interpretation. The SBM is typically static and does not account for time-varying data
or evolving consumer behaviour. For transactional data that changes over time, this limitation could affect the
model’s ability to recognize changing patterns in spending behaviour. Additionally, the SBM relies on Bayesian
probabilistic inference, which can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets. This complexity
is further compounded by the need to make specific choices regarding priors, for which there is not always a clear
method, adding another layer of uncertainty to the modelling process. Moreover, the probabilistic framework
can make the model harder to interpret and explain to non-technical audiences, limiting its practical usability
in certain contexts.

Importance of socio-economic factors
The community detection in the study is based only on the network we build from customer-category connections
and their weights, so it does not directly take into account the consumers’ socio-economic status. This allows for
an unbiased approach of identifying customers with similar spending patterns based only on their transaction
history. However, when developing incentives for sustainable spending for different groups of customers, it is
important to also consider the socio-economic status of the customers and how the incentive might affect their
engagement with the banking institution.

In Appendix 1, we present the dependency of customer retention rates on the index of multiple deprivation
and the age of the customers. Customers who are younger and live in more deprived regions tend to have higher
drop  out  probability.  The  literature  supports  the  finding  that  older  customers  are  less  likely  to  switch  their
banking provider51,52. The sustainable baking initiative we analyse also has a monthly fee to upkeep one’s account
so this could present a barrier for customers from highly deprived areas to keep their accounts.

As  different  socio-economic  metrics  prove  to  be  important  for  customer  retention  rates  in  paid  banking
initiatives, such institutions should take into account the socio-economic status of the consumer clusters they
aim to incentivise, developing nudges that are tailored to their financial realities, such as flexible pricing and
lower fees. These findings can also help policymakers to design inclusive financial policies that support diverse
consumer needs and promote broader financial inclusion.

Wells et al.18 similarly highlight the role of demographics in shaping carbon footprints, showing that income,
age, gender, and tenure influence the clustering of customers based on emissions. Their findings support our view
that socio-economic variables should be incorporated into the design and targeting of behavioural interventions.

However, we find that once customers join the sustainable banking initiative, socio-economic measures have
no significant effect on the carbon emission levels associated with them. This suggests that the initiative’s impact
on carbon emissions is uniform across different socio-economic groups. The median value of carbon emissions
in Fig. 10, derived from our sustainable banking dataset, is 685 grams per GBP. This figure is slightly lower than
the values reported in other studies examining carbon emissions from large banking institutions6. This difference
may result from multiple factors such as increased use of debit cards53 in the years between the studies, changing
trends in consumer preferences after the COVID-19 pandemic54, and different spending habits between users of
large banks and the smaller-scale baking initiative we focus on.

Applications, policy implications, and ethical considerations
Behavioural nudging is designed to subtly guide customers towards specific behaviours without restricting their
freedom of choice55,56. The results of our study can be used to nudge large groups of customers with similar
spending habits, without having to develop specific incentives for each customer individually. By applying SBMs,
we can detect communities of consumers who exhibit similar patterns of spending and associated emissions,
allowing institutions to design community-level behavioural interventions. For instance, if a specific consumer
cluster  is  characterised  by  unusually  high  spending  on  fuel  or  air  travel,  banking  applications  could  display
category-specific  nudges  to  promote  alternatives  such  as  public  transport,  carpooling,  or  carbon  offsetting.
Unlike individualised approaches, this method allows for scalable interventions that maintain user privacy while
still leveraging behavioural data to promote sustainability.

Additionally, the results of the weighted version of the SBM can help test the same nudges on consumers
with  similar  purchasing  profiles  but  different  socio-economic  status,  geographic  location,  or  demographic
background. This allows financial institutions and policymakers to compare intervention effectiveness across
groups  that  behave  similarly  in  the  marketplace  but  differ  in  external  characteristics.  Such  comparison  can
inform the development of more fine-tuned and equitable behavioural incentives, allowing for context-sensitive
adaptation of policies. For example, a nudge that successfully reduces emissions in a high-income urban cluster
might be less effective or even counterproductive in a rural or lower-income group with limited mobility options.
The segmentation produced by the weighted SBM creates a structure for not only targeting but also evaluating
and adapting behavioural policies in a responsible and data-driven manner.

However,  the  application  of  behavioural  nudges  raises  several  ethical  and  societal  considerations56–58.
Nudges are meant to influence decision-making processes, often without explicit awareness. Even if the aim is
to promote environmentally friendly behaviour, it is crucial to maintain transparency so customers are aware of
how their decisions are being influenced, thereby preserving their autonomy. Equity and fairness are also essential
in  designing  nudging  strategies.  There  is  a  risk  that  nudges  could  disproportionately  impact  certain  groups,
especially if they are based on socio-economic indicators like income or age. For example, encouraging reduced
spending  on  certain  goods  might  be  more  challenging  for  lower-income  customers,  potentially  exacerbating
existing inequalities. Inclusive design and careful consideration are therefore necessary to ensure that nudging
strategies do not disadvantage specific groups. Developing differentiated nudges for different socio-economic
communities–while  treating  them  with  equal  respect  and  concern–is  an  essential  component  of  responsible
behavioural policy.

Furthermore, while nudges can lead to short-term behavioural adjustments, their impact on long-term habits
is  less  certain.  Financial  institutions  and  policymakers  must  evaluate  whether  their  strategies  foster  genuine,
lasting changes in behaviour or merely temporary compliance. Sustainable change is more likely to be achieved
through  a  combination  of  nudging,  educational  outreach,  and  participatory  engagement  with  communities.
By  addressing  these  broader  societal  implications,  nudging  can  more  effectively  foster  low-carbon  consumer
behaviour while maintaining trust and respect for individual freedoms.

In terms of broader implications, the findings from this research suggest that sustainable banking initiatives
should  adopt  flexible,  data-informed  strategies  for  customer  consumption  targeting.  The  use  of  SBM  allows
institutions to identify coherent consumer groups whose purchasing patterns carry distinct carbon signatures.
Rather than assuming uniform behaviour across an entire customer base, these communities enable targeted
outreach and policy experimentation. Such segmentation supports not only efficient deployment of behavioural
nudges,  but  also  more  inclusive  and  adaptive  sustainability  strategies.  Policymakers,  in  turn,  can  use  these
insights to design fairer and more effective climate policies that take into account how consumption, and its
environmental impact, varies across the population.

Limitations of financial transaction data
Financial  transaction  data  offer  a  valuable  lens  into  consumer  behaviour,  but  their  use  is  subject  to  several
important limitations that affect policy relevance. Access to such data is often constrained by privacy concerns
and  commercial  restrictions6,  which  limits  the  availability  of  representative  datasets  and  poses  barriers  to
broader  policy  applications.  Another  significant  limitation  to  the  use  of  transaction  datasets  is  that  current
research depends on samples derived from a single bank or financial institution, which may introduce biases,
omitting  customers  who  primarily  bank  elsewhere  or  remain  unbanked18.  This  also  applies  to  our  dataset,
as  it  reflects  a  sustainability-oriented  subsample  of  the  population,  limiting  representativeness  compared  to
the general population. In our data, also key categories like utility payments and cash expenditures are often
missing or underrepresented, as many such payments occur via direct debit or cash, which are not captured
comprehensively in transaction data.

Additionally, carbon footprint estimates based on spending data inherently assume uniform carbon intensity
within  merchant  categories,  which  can  mask  important  variations  in  product-level  emissions6.    Combining
data  from  multiple  financial  institutions  and  other  sources  such  as  surveys  can  provide  a  more  robust  basis

for analysis. Nonetheless, despite these limitations, transaction data remain a promising tool for scalable and
dynamic carbon accounting, offering insights into spending behaviour on individual level.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the potential of the SBM for analysing consumer behaviour and carbon emissions in
financial transaction data. By identifying community structures within customer data, SBM helps the creation
of  archetypal  profiles  that  capture  distinct  spending  habits  and  their  corresponding  environmental  impact.
These  profiles  provide  valuable  insights  for  banks,  policymakers,  and  other  institutions  for  creating  targeted
interventions that promote more sustainable consumption patterns and reduce carbon emissions.

The  findings  of  this  research  provide  a  foundation  for  understanding  how  consumer  behaviour  relates  to
carbon emissions across various spending categories. By clustering customers with similar spending profiles,
the study allows for targeted interventions and personalised strategies. Additionally, these clusters are associated
with  similar  carbon  emission  profiles,  highlighting  groups  of  customers  whose  behaviour  contributes  to
comparable  environmental  impacts.  This  approach  provides  institutions  with  a  data-driven  framework  for
designing interventions that encourage more sustainable consumption and carbon reduction.

While the current approach is based on a static bipartite network, future research could benefit from extending
this model to dynamic and multi-level networks. Such models would be able to capture the evolving nature of
consumer behaviour and the temporal changes in carbon emissions, providing more accurate insights over time.
Incorporating a temporal dimension would allow for a better understanding of how consumption behaviours
change and how interventions influence carbon emissions in the long term. Dynamic models would also offer
insights into how consumer decisions evolve, refining strategies to drive sustainable behaviour in the long run.

In conclusion, this research establishes the SBM approach as a powerful tool for understanding consumer
dynamics  and  facilitating  data-driven  interventions  to  reduce  carbon  footprints.  By  clustering  customers
based on spending and emission patterns, this study offers a comprehensive framework for studying consumer
behaviour and its environmental impact. Future research incorporating dynamic, temporal analyses will further
enhance the adaptability of these models, supporting more effective resource allocation and policy interventions
to achieve sustainability goals.

Data availibility
The  publicly  available  data  used  in  this  study,  including  the  Index  of  Multiple  Deprivation  (IMD),  the  Liv-
ing Costs and Food Survey (LCFS), and the UK Multi-Region Input-Output (UKMRIO) data, can be accessed
through the Office for National Statistics (ONS) database. The transaction dataset used in this research is confi-
dential and cannot be shared due to data protection agreements.

Appendix 1: Impact of socio-economic metrics on client retention and carbon
emissions
In this appendix, we outline the socio-economic background and age of the customers in our financial dataset
compared to the general UK population. We then develop a logistic regression model to predict client retention
rates based on socio-economic and age metrics, highlighting the need for tailored emission-reduction interven-
tions based on these factors.
The users of ekko20, the sustainable banking initiative, are predominantly younger people and individuals
living in highly deprived areas (see Fig. 8). Research suggests that younger people are generally more environ-
mentally conscious, which explains their strong interest in sustainable financial products59,60. Additionally,
individuals from deprived areas may be more motivated to adopt eco-friendly practices due to higher pollution
rates in their communities61,62.
We explore the impact of socio-economic metrics on client retention rates within the sustainable banking
dataset. Understanding these factors can help financial institutions in designing effective incentives aimed at
encouraging customers to modify their spending behaviors and reduce their emissions patterns. We also pres-
ent total carbon emissions of customers and the differences between emissions per cluster.
We use a logistic regression model to predict client drop-out probability based on age and deprivation (as
defined by the IMD Rank) values. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.78, indicating its ability to correctly
classify clients into retained and dropped-out categories. According to the classification report, the model
shows strong precision (0.78) and recall (0.97) for retained clients, suggesting good performance in identify-
ing those likely to stay with the banking initiative. However, for clients likely to drop out, precision and recall
are lower at 0.71 and 0.22, respectively, reflecting challenges in accurately predicting drop-outs. We obtain a
weighted average F1-score of 0.73, suggesting balanced performance across both classes with some room for
improvement in predicting drop-outs. The model has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.744 which indi-
cates moderate discriminatory ability in distinguishing between retained and dropped-out clients based on the
given features. These results underscore the significance of age and deprivation metrics in understanding and
potentially mitigating client retention within sustainable banking initiatives.
We present the predicted client retention/drop-out probability in Fig. 9a and the respective receiver operating
characteristic curve and AUC value in Fig. 9b. Individuals living in highly deprived areas and older individuals
have a higher probability of dropping out of the sustainable banking FinTech.
We also examine the distribution of carbon emissions across customers (see Fig. 10a) in order to compare
these values with other studies. We obtain a median value 685 grams of carbon emitted for every pound spent.
We look at carbon emissions per cluster—panel (b) of Fig. 10 illustrates a diagram for the three clusters with

the highest carbon emissions, identified using the unweighted SBM, showing the specific categories contrib-
uting most to these clusters’ carbon footprints. The visualizations in Fig. 10 highlight the variation in carbon
emissions among customers and emphasize how emissions differ for clusters based on merchant categories.

Appendix 2: Spending and transactions percentage heatmaps
We present the heatmaps with the percentage of transactions Fig. 11 and percentage of amount spent Fig. 12 per
merchant category across customer clusters.
The heatmaps provide insights into customer preferences across different merchant categories, which is crucial
for designing targeted sustainability initiatives. By analyzing the distribution of transactions and spending, we
can identify clusters that prioritize sustainable or lower-emission categories. This understanding allows us to
create tailored marketing strategies or interventions that encourage customers to shift their spending towards
these categories, ultimately reducing carbon emissions.
Comparing both transaction volume and spending amounts across clusters can help pinpoint which customer
segments have the most significant influence on emissions in specific MCCs. A cluster with a high percentage
of transactions and a significant amount spent in high-emission categories can be prioritized for targeted inter-
ventions aimed at reducing carbon footprints. By focusing our sustainability efforts on these high-impact clus-
ters, we can maximize the effectiveness of our initiatives and drive meaningful reductions in overall emissions.

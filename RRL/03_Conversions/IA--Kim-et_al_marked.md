Abstract
Time series forecasting is a critical task that provides key information for decision-making
across various fields, such as economic planning, supply chain management, and medical
diagnosis. After the use of traditional statistical methodologies and machine learning in
the past, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs,
and GNNs have been developed and applied to solve time series forecasting problems.
However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning
architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling
long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series
forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear
layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for
using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging
architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context of exploration into various models,
the architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This
survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers
comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification.
By comparing and re-examining various deep learning models, we uncover new perspec-
tives and present the latest trends in time series forecasting, including the emergence of
hybrid models, diffusion models, Mamba models, and foundation models. By focusing on
the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have
gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift,
causality, and feature extraction. This survey explores vital elements that can enhance
forecasting performance through diverse approaches. These contributions help lower entry
barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research
areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader per-
spectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

1 Introduction
Time series forecasting (TSF) is a task that predicts future values based on sequential his-
torical data (Cryer 1986). It is utilized as a key decision-making tool in various fields, such
as economics and finance, supply chain management, transportation, energy, weather, and
healthcare (Danese and Kalchschmidt 2011; Abu-Mostafa and Atiya 1996; Alghamdi et al
2019; Nti et al 2020; Dimri et al 2020; Soyiri and Reidpath 2013). Such applications offer
various opportunities, including cost reduction, increased efficiency, and enhanced com-
petitiveness (Danese and Kalchschmidt 2011). The diversity and complexity of time series
data make forecasting challenging. In addition to apparent information, hidden patterns and
irregular values pose challenges in learning temporal dependencies (Chen et al 2024d).
In multivariate problems, additional factors such as channel correlation make the task
even more difficult (Sect. 2.1). Furthermore, time series data exhibits different characteris-
tics depending on the domain, and the various times and environments in which the series
is collected result in significantly different patterns (Sect. 2.3). Because of this, TSF prob-
lems exhibit limited model generalizability, requiring diverse architectures and approaches.
The increasingly complicated TSF problems are presenting researchers with growing chal-
lenges, which has recently led to the active development of new methodologies and algo-
rithms to address these issues (Lim and Zohren 2021).
TSF is closely connected to core AI challenges, and solving these problems plays a
crucial role in advancing the field of AI. For instance, the generalization of AI models is
essential for ensuring stable performance on new data. However, time series data presents
unique characteristics and domain-specific patterns that make generalization particularly
challenging (Han et al 2023b). Solutions to generalization in TSF provide new insights that
are applicable to other fields, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer
Vision (CV). The distribution of real-world time series data can change over time, and mod-
els must effectively handle these changes (Sect. 5.2). TSF plays a crucial role in addressing
distribution shift issues, and the techniques developed to solve these problems can extend
to other AI domains, such as image, video, and NLP. Moreover, attempts to understand
models are crucial for improving their trustworthiness in real-world applications (Han et al
2023a). In mission-critical fields such as healthcare and finance, the explainability of time
series prediction models is essential. For example, explaining how stock price predictions or
patient vital sign forecasts are made can help users better understand and trust the model’s
decisions. Thus, TSF research in explainability provides practical solutions for other AI
applications (Sect. 5.6). Recently, TSF has evolved beyond simple forecasting, establish-
ing itself as a practical platform for addressing key AI challenges. Solving these problems
within TSF highlights the potential for AI to develop in a complementary and synergistic
way.To address these diverse challenges and recent approaches, our survey is organized as
illustrated in Fig. 1, which outlines the overall framework.
Figure 2 shows the number of papers on time series forecasting presented at major AI and
machine learning conferences. This explosive increase demonstrates the growing impor-
tance of TSF research in the AI and machine learning fields. As various studies addressing
time series forecasting problems are being actively conducted, survey papers are also being
frequently published. Over time, numerous survey papers have systematically organized the
vast landscape of TSF, offering in-depth research that has provided valuable guidance and
direction for researchers. However, existing survey papers still have room for improvement,

particularly in addressing the inevitable increase in model diversity and the open challenges
in the field, as summarized in Table 1. This survey aims to reorganize the extensive dis-
course on TSF by providing essential and comprehensive information. At the same time, it
explores model diversity to deliver the latest TSF trends and uniquely highlights open chal-
lenges, clearly presenting them to readers.
Models for TSF have undergone various stages of development over an extended period.
In the past, statistical methods based on moving averages were predominantly used, which
later evolved into traditional approaches such as Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA (Box
et al 1970). Machine learning techniques such as Tree Models (Quinlan 1986) and Support
Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes 1995) have also been frequently used, but they had limita-
tions in learning complex nonlinear patterns (Sect. 3.1). With the increase in available data
and advancements in hardware computing power, various deep learning architectures such
as MLPs (Rumelhart et al 1986), RNNs (Hopfield 1982), CNNs (LeCun et al 1998), and
GNNs (Scarselli et al 2008) were developed, enabling the learning of more complex pat-
terns. However, the performance of these early deep learning architectures was constrained
by their intrinsic designs. To overcome these structural limitations, variants such as Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and Temporal Convolu-
tional Networks (TCN) (Bai et al 2018) have been widely utilized (Sect. 3.2). Transform-
ers (Vaswani et al 2017), known for their ability to handle long-term dependencies, have
demonstrated excellent performance in natural language processing and have been naturally
extended to time series data as well. While Transformers have shown good performance in
TSF and become widely popular, recent cases have shown that simple linear models can
outperform Transformer models (Sect. 3.3). As a result, there has been a significant increase
in reconsidering fundamental deep learning methodologies, along with growing interest
in various architectures such as foundation models, diffusion models, and Mamba models
(Sects. 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5). The Transformer model continues to improve in performance and
still plays a significant role (Sect. 4.1). In this way, TSF has entered a renaissance of model-
ing, with various methodologies actively competing without being dominated by any single
approach (Fig. 3). In this context, this survey offers two major strengths that set it apart from
previous TSF survey papers.

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 7 of 95 216
First, we focus on the inevitable diversification of architectures, providing a timely and
comprehensive view to understand the current trend of architecture diversification. Existing
TSF survey papers, such as (Wen et al 2023; Zhang et al 2024d; Lin et al 2024a; Meijer
and Chen 2024; Patro and Agneeswaran 2024a), focus on providing detailed analyses of
specific architectures but have limitations when it comes to broadly comparing diversi-
fied architectures, including newly emerging ones. This paper systematically compares
the developmental progress of various architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Trans-
former, Diffusion, foundation models, Mamba) and analyzes the strengths, weaknesses, and
contributions of each. In addition, it addresses the performance of hybrid models that com-
bine the strengths of multiple architectures, clearly highlighting key trends in TSF. With
these contributions, readers can effectively understand the continuously evolving trends and
directions of advancement in the field. Through this, it lowers the entry barrier for newcom-
ers to TSF and provides a comprehensive roadmap that opens up new research opportunities
for established researchers.
Second, we explore from the perspective of open challenges. Although numerous
advanced architectures have resolved many issues, the core challenges in TSF continue to
persist. In particular, issues such as channel correlation, distribution shifts, causality, and
feature extraction (Sect. 5) remain significant challenges that need to be addressed (Fig. 4).
This survey explores the latest methodologies aimed at addressing these challenges and
provides readers with valuable insights for problem-solving. While some existing surveys
address these TSF challenges, they often focus on only a few problems. In contrast, this
paper takes an issue-driven approach, deeply examining seven key TSF problems and orga-
nizing new solutions.
This survey covers the fundamental concepts of time series data and the problem defini-
tion of forecasting in Sect. 2, followed by an examination of the evolution of past meth-
odologies in Sect. 3. Section 4 analyzes the key features of the latest models, and finally,
Sect. 5, explores the open challenges in TSF and their solutions. Through this, readers will
gain a broad understanding of the past and present of TSF research and acquire new ideas
for future studies.
2 Background
In this section, before exploring time series forecasting models, we explain the definition
and key characteristics of time series data to provide the necessary background. We also
define the problem of time series forecasting tasks, discussing related datasets and evalu-
ation metrics. This establishes the basic concepts of time series forecasting and provides
preliminary information to help understand the models discussed in the following sections.
2.1 Time-series data
Time series data is a collection of sequential data points gathered at regular time intervals,
representing a series of observations of phenomena that change over time. This temporal
continuity allows for the understanding and analysis of phenomena that evolve according to
time order. Each data point represents the state or value at a specific moment, and through
the observation of these data points, various patterns such as long-term trends, seasonality,

cyclicality, and irregularities can be recognized. These patterns provide valuable informa-
tion for predicting future values or detecting changes at critical moments. By extracting and
studying the meaningful information provided by time series data, researchers can develop
practical applications to address challenges in various disciplines.
Characteristics of time series data
Time series data encapsulates various characteristics that play a critical role in explaining
the diverse patterns and fluctuations within time series. Understanding these characteristic
elements is essential for analyzing and predicting data. The key properties are explained in
Fig. 5.
In time series data, the above features frequently appear in a mixed form. Therefore,
decomposition is commonly used to separate the components for detailed analysis, or dis-
tribution shift alleviation methods are widely applied. Many time series datasets provide
information on multivariate variables. Sometimes, these data provide additional information
that univariate data cannot, and it is important to understand this for many problems. The
main properties are explained in Fig. 6.
These additional features convey the complexity of the real world in greater detail and
sometimes provide reasons for significant pattern changes. Considering this information can
lead to more precise time series analysis and forecasting.
2.2 Time-series forecasting
Time series forecasting involves analyzing historical time-series data to predict future val-
ues. This process entails analyzing inherent temporal patterns in the data, such as trends and
seasonality, using past observations to estimate future values. The goal of time series fore-
casting is to support decision-making by providing information about an uncertain future,
such as predicting future demand changes or fluctuations in prices. Time series forecast-
ing can employ various methodologies, including statistical methods, machine learning,
and deep learning. These methodologies focus on capturing the characteristics of data as it
changes over time.
Univariate time series forecasting (UTSF)
Univariate forecasting refers to making predictions using only one variable. For exam-
ple, predicting the next day’s temperature based solely on past temperature data from a
weather station is a univariate forecast. The advantage of univariate forecasting is that the
models are simple and computationally efficient. Since the data consists of a single variable,
the model is relatively straightforward and easy to understand, making data collection and
management easier. However, it may only utilize limited information as it cannot account
for important external factors or interactions between different variables.
xˆ t+1:t+h =f(x t p:t ) (1)
−
The formula representing UTSF is shown in Eq. (1). The model takes the past p+1 time
steps, specifically the data from t
−
p to t, as input to make predictions. Here, xˆ t+1:t+h
represents the predicted values from t+1 to t+h. Single-step forecasting predicts only
one value when h=1, while multi-step forecasting predicts multiple values when h>1.
Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF)
1 3

216 Page 10 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Fig. 4 Overview of latest open challenges in time series forecasting
Multivariate forecasting involves making predictions using multiple variables simultane-
ously. For instance, in weather forecasting, predicting the next day’s temperature by con-
sidering various variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed is an example of
multivariate forecasting. By incorporating interactions and correlations between multiple
variables, multivariate forecasting can capture complex relationships, offering higher pre-
dictive accuracy. However, these models tend to be more complex, require more data, and
can be more challenging to handle, increasing the risk of overfitting.
To incorporate other influencing variables, we can extend the model to a multivariate
approach.
Xˆ
t+1:t+h
=f(Xt
p:t
) (2)
−
The formula representing MTSF is shown in Eq. (2). Xt p:t is a set of vectors over the
−
past p+1 time steps, where each vector contains the values of multiple variables at time t
. This model takes multiple variables from the past p+1 time steps, specifically Xt p:t, as
input to generate the multivariate predicted values from t+1 to t+h, denoted as Xˆ t − +1:t+h
. This multivariate approach allows for more comprehensive modeling by considering both
the target variable’s history and the effects of other relevant factors. Figure 7 illustrates how
a multivariate forecasting model uses a past lookback window to predict future intervals.

Fig. 5 Properties of time series data
Short-term time series forecasting (STSF)
Short-term time series forecasting focuses on predictions for the near future, making it
suitable for tasks that require quick responses, such as immediate operational planning or
short-term decision-making. The models are simple, making them easy to train and imple-
ment, and they often demonstrate relatively high accuracy. However, because the forecast
range is short, it cannot capture long-term trends or complex variations, which limits its
applicability.
Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF)
Long-term time series forecasting deals with predictions for the distant future, with fore-
cast horizons increasingly extending to several months, years, or beyond. It is valuable for
long-term strategy planning, investment decisions, and policy-making, addressing many
1 3

real-world problems. By identifying long-term trends and cycles, organizations can prepare
accordingly, highlighting its significance. However, predicting the distant future is challeng-
ing, and extensive research is being conducted to improve accuracy.
2.3 Time series forecasting datasets
Models for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) are primarily trained and evaluated using open
benchmark datasets. Open datasets offer data that has already been collected across vari-
ous fields, allowing researchers to use them without going through separate data collection
processes. Additionally, researchers can objectively compare the performance of different
models and convincingly demonstrate the contributions of their developed models.
Datasets frequently used by time series forecasting models in various domains, such as
energy consumption, traffic, weather, exchange rates, and disease outbreaks, are listed in
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 13 of 95 216
Table 2. These time series datasets are typically collected in real-time via sensors, recorded
as transaction logs in financial markets, accumulated as server logs, or gathered through
periodic surveys.
Time series data exist across a wide range of domains, each exhibiting unique char-
acteristics. This diversity is due to the nature of time series data, which addresses real-
world problems in various fields and can display highly varied patterns depending on time
and environmental factors. For example, stock price data often show long-term upward or
downward trends. Stock market fluctuations tend to move in specific directions over the
long term due to complex influences such as economic conditions, corporate performance,
and policy changes. In contrast, electricity consumption data exhibit pronounced periodicity
throughout the day, with higher consumption during daytime hours and lower consumption
at night. There are also seasonal patterns, with different consumption rates during summer
and winter.
Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive (Godahewa et al 2021l) points out that there
is no comprehensive time series dataset archive and thus provides a thorough time series
repository. This repository offers 30 datasets for real-world data and competition purposes,
covering various domains such as energy, economics, nature, and sales. Details are specified
in Table 3.
Time series data exhibit a greater variety of domain-specific characteristics compared
to Natural Language Processing (NLP). These differences in dataset characteristics make
time series forecasting problems more diverse and complex, reducing the generalizability
of time series forecasting models. Consequently, developing foundation models for TSF is
more challenging compared to NLP. Time series data lack the well-designed vocabulary and
grammar found in NLP, and obtaining vast amounts of data is more difficult than in fields
like Computer Vision (CV) or NLP. In the CV field, there are general benchmark datasets
such as MNIST and ImageNet, while in NLP, there are datasets like GLUE (General Lan-
guage Understanding Evaluation) and SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset). In
contrast, the time series analysis field lacks large-scale general benchmark datasets and
large-scale challenges like those in image and language domains. The most famous time
series forecasting competition is the M-Competitions, which started in 1982 and has only
been held six times to date. The paper “Time Series Dataset Survey for Forecasting with
Deep Learning” (Hahn et al 2023) highlights the lack of general benchmark datasets for
TSF and analyzes the statistical characteristics of datasets across various domains, cluster-
ing them to provide easily accessible information for researchers. We do not delve into
the characteristics of the datasets in detail, but instead provide a brief overview of the key
datasets. Recently, the development of foundation models for time series has begun, leading
to the gradual emergence of general datasets for TSF. Details about TSF foundation models
will be discussed in Sect. 4.3.
2.4 Evaluation metrics
The evaluation metrics used in TSF play a crucial role in objectively comparing and assess-
ing model performance. Common metrics for deterministic models include Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), which are easy to use because they allow
intuitive comparisons of prediction errors. On the other hand, probabilistic models that can
reflect uncertainty typically use Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which mea-

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 15 of 95 216
sures the accuracy of distribution forecasts by evaluating the difference between predicted
and actual distributions (Matheson and Winkler 1976). However, the limitations of these
traditional evaluation metrics have been noted, leading to the proposal of various perfor-
mance metrics (Thompson 1990).
The distinct characteristics of time series data necessitate the use of diverse metrics in
TSF. It is essential to assess not only the magnitude of errors but also how well the model
learns the temporal patterns and various features of time series data. Table 4 categorizes
evaluation metrics by type and explains each metric.
Error-based metrics for deterministic models measure the difference between predicted
and actual values. Explained variance metrics assess how well the model explains the vari-
ance of the data (Chicco et al 2021). These metrics evaluate how well the model captures key
patterns such as seasonality or trends in the data, thereby aiding in the structural understand-
ing of the predictions. Error metrics focus on accuracy, but they do not assess overfitting,
whereas explained variance evaluates the model’s generalization ability. Model selection
metrics help identify the optimal model (Portet 2020). These metrics take into account fac-
tors such as sample size and the number of parameters, playing a key role in selecting the
optimal model. Thus, they are particularly useful for choosing the most appropriate model
for a given dataset. For instance, in noisy environments, MAE is preferred over MSE due
to its reduced sensitivity to outliers. Additionally, when evaluating non-stationary data, it is
important to use metrics that effectively capture changes in trends and seasonality. In such
cases, cumulative error-based metrics or explained variance metrics can be useful.
Probabilistic model evaluation metrics, on the other hand, account for uncertainty,
enabling the assessment of both the confidence and variability of predictions. These met-
rics help evaluate not only the predicted values but also the uncertainty surrounding them.
Beyond basic error-based metrics, several advanced metrics are used. Interval Metrics
assess the confidence intervals of the predictions, considering both the predicted values
and their associated uncertainty (Khosravi et al 2011). These metrics are especially useful
in fields such as financial market forecasting and risk management. Quantile Metrics evalu-
ate the accuracy of specific quantiles of predicted values, making them particularly useful
when assessing how well various quantiles match the actual values in situations with high
uncertainty (Koenker and Bassett Jr 1978). Quantile Metrics are beneficial in areas such as
weather forecasting and insurance, where forecasts are assessed across different risk levels.
Sharpness Metrics, which evaluate the width of predicted confidence intervals, are used to
assess how narrow and accurate the prediction intervals are (Zhao et al 2020). This metric is
valuable in logistics and supply chain forecasting, where minimizing the width of prediction
intervals is crucial.
Thus, various evaluation metrics are crucial in assessing model performance, and each
should be chosen based on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of
the problem. In real-world scenarios, the appropriate use of metrics allows for the selection
of the most effective model, which can then be leveraged for efficient decision-making. In
contrast, in the field of deep learning research, MSE and MAE remain widely used due to
their simplicity, intuitiveness, and the fact that they have been extensively utilized in previ-
ous studies, making them suitable for performance comparison (Chen et al 2023).

3 Historical TSF models
3.1 Conventional methods (before deep learning)
3.1.1 Statistical models
Prior to machine learning and deep learning, traditional statistical models, which laid the
foundation for analyzing sequential data, were commonly utilized for time series forecast-
ing. Exponential smoothing was introduced by Brown (1959), Holt (1957), and Winters
(1960) as a method to forecast future values using a weighted average of past data. This
method operates by computing an exponential weight decay of historical data, assign-
ing greater weight to more recent data. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model was formalized through the work of George Box and Gwilym Jenkins in
their book “Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control” (Box et al 1970). The ARIMA
model predicts future values by leveraging the autocorrelation in data and is composed
of three main components. AutoRegressive (AR) uses a linear combination of past values
to predict the current value. Moving Average (MA) employs a linear combination of past
error terms to predict the current value. Integrated (I) removes non-stationarity (the property
where mean and variance change over time) by differencing the data to achieve stationarity.
While exponential smoothing models are advantageous for real-time data analysis due to
their simplicity, ARIMA models are better suited for capturing complex patterns, making
them ideal for long-term forecasting. The SARIMA model extends ARIMA by incorporat-
ing seasonal differencing, along with seasonal autoregressive and moving average compo-
nents, allowing it to effectively model and predict data with regular cyclical patterns. These
statistical models are based on specific assumptions and are simple, intuitive, and useful for
identifying basic patterns in data.
3.1.2 Machine learning models
While statistical methods struggle to capture complex patterns in time series data due to
their reliance on predefined linear relationships, machine learning models excel in learn-
ing nonlinear patterns directly from the data without relying on such assumptions. To
address the limitations of statistical methods, traditional machine learning models have
been increasingly applied to time series forecasting. Decision Trees (Quinlan 1986) are
machine learning models that use a tree structure for classification or prediction. The term
“classification and regression tree (CART) analysis” was first introduced by Barlin et al
(2013), and in time series forecasting, regression decision trees are used to split data into
a tree structure to predict continuous values. While they are intuitive and easy to interpret,
they are prone to overfitting. Support Vector Machines (SVM), introduced by Cortes and
Vapnik (Cortes 1995), are supervised learning models used for classification and regression
analysis, characterized by finding the maximum margin. They handle high-dimensional data
and non-linearities effectively, making them robust for classification and regression tasks.
Support Vector Regression (SVR) applies SVM concepts to regression problems, predict-
ing data points using an optimal hyperplane (Vapnik et al 1996). This hyperplane is trained
to minimize errors between data points, ensuring errors do not exceed a certain threshold.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were developed in 1999 with an explicit regression
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 21 of 95 216
gradient boosting algorithm. This method uses ensemble learning to combine multiple weak
models into a single, strong predictive model (Friedman 2001). This method iteratively
improves the model, offering high predictive performance. XGBoost, an extension of the
Gradient Boosting algorithm (Chen and Guestrin 2016), incorporates various optimization
techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. It gained significant attention for its
outstanding performance in machine learning competitions, particularly in time series fore-
casting challenges. These machine learning models outperform traditional statistical mod-
els in capturing data structures and patterns, demonstrating high predictive power on large
datasets (Kontopoulou et al 2023). Their ability to automatically learn and optimize various
data features and relationships has led to their widespread use in time series forecasting.
3.2 Fundamental deep learning models
3.2.1 MLPs: The emergence and constraints of early artificial neural networks
The development of the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) (Rumelhart et al 1986) and the
backpropagation algorithm established the foundation for artificial neural networks. Early
artificial neural network models utilizing these MLPs demonstrated strong performance in
modeling nonlinear patterns, prompting numerous attempts to apply them to time series data
processing. However, several key limitations, as outlined below, restricted the training of
deep neural networks using MLPs.
● Limited in learning temporal dependencies: MLPs are well-suited for processing fixed-
length input vectors but struggle to adequately capture the temporal dependencies in
time series data.
● Vanishing gradient issue: The vanishing gradient problem in deep networks made train-
ing difficult.
● Lack of data and computing resources: The scarcity of large-scale datasets and high-
performance computing resources made it challenging to effectively train complex neu-
ral network models.
At that time, artificial neural network technology was still immature, and there was a lack
of deep understanding and effective methodologies for dealing with time series data. Con-
sequently, traditional statistical methods and machine learning models previously discussed
continued to be widely used for time series analysis.
3.2.2 RNNs: The first neural network capable of processing sequential data and
modeling temporal dependencies
The emergence and early applications of RNNs
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Hopfield 1982) emerged, opening up new possi-
bilities for processing time series data. RNNs are specialized models designed to process
sequential data, such as time series data, and were utilized to overcome the limitations of
MLPs. The structure of an RNN consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output
layer, and it uses the output from previous time steps(hidden layer output) as the input for
the current time step. This structural feature allows RNNs to naturally model the dependen-
1 3

216 Page 22 of 95 J. Kim et al.
cies in data over time. The hidden state preserves past information by storing data from
the previous step and passing it on to the next step, thereby maintaining historical context.
Additionally, it is parametrically efficient because the same weights are used for calcula-
tions across all time steps, regardless of the sequence length.
Due to these features, RNNs have been utilized in various fields where sequential data
modeling is crucial, such as time series data analysis, natural language processing (NLP),
and so on. However, early RNNs had the following issues.
● Vanishing gradient problem: When RNNs learn long sequences, the gradient gradually
diminishes during the backpropagation process, causing information from earlier time
steps to fail to reach later time steps. Thus, this made it difficult to learn long-term de-
pendencies.
● Exploding gradient problem: In contrast to the vanishing gradient problem, the gradient
values could become excessively large, making the training process unstable.
● Difficulty in parallel processing: Due to the sequential nature of RNNs, where the com-
putation at each time step depends on the previous one, parallel processing becomes
challenging. This leads to high computational costs and slow learning speeds.
Because of these critical drawbacks, RNNs were not widely used until the early 2000s.
Overcoming the limitations of RNNs
To address the aforementioned issues with vanilla RNNs, researchers began developing
various models. Notably, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmid-
huber 1997) model was developed to address the long-term dependency issues of vanilla
RNNs. With the cell state and gate mechanisms (input, output, and forget gates), LSTMs
preserve crucial information over extended periods and discard unnecessary information.
The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al 2014) emerged as a simpler alternative to
LSTM, offering similar performance while using a more straightforward structure(update
and reset gates) to manage information. These two models effectively addressed the vanish-
ing gradient problem and sparked a boom in RNN-based models for time series analysis.
Many subsequent RNN-based models used these two as their backbone, making them pow-
erful tools for handling time series data until the advent of Transformers.
Notable RNN variants
The Dilated RNN (Chang et al 2017) proposed Dilated Recurrent Skip Connections as a
solution to various issues inherent in fundamental vanilla RNNs. This approach enhanced
parameter efficiency in long sequences and enabled the network to effectively learn complex
dependencies across diverse temporal scales. The DA-RNN (Qin et al 2017) attempted to
effectively address long-term dependencies, which were challenging for existing methods,
by employing a dual-stage attention mechanism. Utilizing an encoder with Input Atten-
tion and a decoder with Temporal Attention, it adaptively selected salient information from
input features and temporal steps, thereby enhancing the accuracy and performance of time
series predictions. Additionally, the MQ-RNN (Wen et al 2017) combined the Sequence-
to-Sequence neural network framework with Quantile Regression to provide probabilistic
forecasts, thereby reflecting uncertainties across various scenarios. This model simultane-
ously generated multiple forecast horizons at each time step and employed the Forking-
Sequences training method to enhance the stability and performance of the RNN.

3.2.3 CNNs: Extracting key patterns in time series data beyond just images
The emergence and early applications of CNNs
The Neocognitron (Fukushima 1980) was designed for visual pattern recognition and
served as an early form of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing the funda-
mental concepts of CNNs. The CNN architecture, which became more widely known with
the development of LeNet (LeCun et al 1998), learned spatial patterns in images through a
combination of convolutional and pooling layers. These features made CNNs well-suited
for handling image data, leading early CNN-based models to primarily focus on image data
without being directly applied to time series data. However, over time, their potential for
handling time series data has also been recognized.
Attempts to apply CNNs to time series data
1D CNNs use one-dimensional convolutional filters to learn local patterns in time series
data, allowing them to extract features that consider the temporal structure of the data. A
prominent example is WaveNet (Van Den Oord et al 2016), which utilized 1D convolutions
and dilated convolutions to model speech signals, effectively capturing long-term depen-
dencies in audio signals. WaveNet demonstrated the utility of CNN-based models in speech
synthesis and time series prediction, leading to the widespread adoption of CNN-based
models for time series analysis. The development of the Temporal Convolutional Networks
(TCNs) (Bai et al 2018) model further highlighted the potential of CNN-based models in the
time series domain. TCN consists of multiple layers of 1D convolutional networks, using
dilated convolutions at each layer to achieve a wide receptive field, enabling the construc-
tion of deeper networks. This allows TCNs to effectively learn from long sequences of data.
TCNs have demonstrated excellent performance in various sequential domains, including
time series prediction, signal processing, and natural language processing.
CNN and RNN Hybrid models
Building on the popularity of fundamental time series forecasting models like RNNs and
the emerging interest in CNN models, hybrid CNN-RNN models began to emerge, com-
bining the strengths of both architectures. Models that combined CNNs and LSTMs were
particularly advantageous for simultaneously learning local patterns and long-term depen-
dencies in time series data. The structure involved using CNNs to extract complex features
from the time series data and LSTMs to learn temporal dependencies.
DCRNN (Li et al 2018) modeled traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph,
capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies. The Diffusion Convolution leveraged
bidirectional random walks on the graph to capture spatial dependencies within the traffic
network, while the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) modeled temporal dependencies. The
introduction of the Diffusion Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (DCGRU) enabled the
effective processing of temporal information. TPA-LSTM (Shih et al 2019) combined CNN
and LSTM with an added attention mechanism, introducing the Temporal Pattern Attention
(TPA) methodology to learn important patterns in time series data. Local patterns were
extracted using CNN, while the combination of LSTM and the attention mechanism cap-
tured significant temporal patterns.
3.2.4 GNNs: Structurally modeling relationships between variables
The emergence and slow growth of GNN-based models
1 3

216 Page 24 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Scarselli et al 2008) were primarily developed to pro-
cess graph-structured data because they can effectively model the complex structural rela-
tionships between nodes and edges in graph data. Over time, GNNs gradually began to be
applied to time series data analysis, primarily because multivariate time-series data often
encapsulates intricate structural relationships.
During their initial development, GNNs were less popular compared to widely used
RNN or CNN-based models. The prevailing belief was that GNNs were not suitable for
time series analysis compared to CNNs which are effective at extracting local patterns,
and RNNs which are strong at learning long-term dependencies. However, as the range
and complexity of time-series data increased, understanding their structural characteristics
became more important. Consequently, GNNs began to gain prominence in fields such as
traffic prediction and social networks. Research on applying GNNs to time-series data has
primarily focused on capturing the dynamic characteristics of graph data, and the structural
learning capabilities of GNNs have proven to be highly useful in capturing the complex
patterns within time-series data.
Development and expansion of GNN applications
Until the development of Transformers, GNNs consistently garnered interest, showing
consistent yet slow growth compared to RNNs and CNNs. The development of Graph Con-
volutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf and Welling 2017) marked another turning point for
GNNs. GCNs learn node features through convolution operations on graph structures and
are powerful tools for processing graph data. This advancement positioned GCNs as a ver-
satile solution for addressing a wide range of graph-based challenges.
GCNs were more effective at learning the relationships between variables in time series
and temporal locality, and subsequently, GNNs began to be widely used for time-series data.
Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) (Yan et al 2018) were devel-
oped as a model combining GCNs and RNNs to learn complex patterns in spatio-temporal
data. By leveraging GCNs to learn spatial patterns and RNNs to capture temporal patterns
effectively, ST-GCN demonstrated the potential of GNNs in time-series problems, such as
traffic prediction. Graph Attention Networks (GATs) (Veličković et al 2018) were intro-
duced, learning relationships between nodes using an attention mechanism. This allowed
GATs to capture the importance of nodes, making them advantageous for identifying sig-
nificant events in time-series data. Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) (Ma et al
2020) were developed to learn graph structures that change over time. Designed to reflect
the dynamic characteristics of time-series data, DyGNNs could effectively capture com-
plex temporal dependencies and structural relationships by allowing the graph structure to
evolve over time. Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) (Rossi et al 2020) were introduced as
a model in which the nodes of a graph change over time, enabling the learning of temporal
patterns in time-series data. By using a memory module to track the temporal state changes
of nodes, TGNs learn the information of neighboring nodes whose importance varies over
time, thus providing a basis for predicting future states.
After the era of traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methodologies,
fundamental deep learning approaches such as RNNs, CNNs, and GNNs were widely used
for time-series analysis and prediction over a long period. However, the advent of Trans-
formers brought a revolutionary change to the AI field. Upon their introduction, Transform-
ers outperformed all existing methods across various domains and continue to dominate
as the leading foundation model. In the time-series domain, a similar trend was observed.

Beginning with the introduction of the Logsparse Transformer (Li et al 2019), numerous
transformer-based models emerged, achieving state-of-the-art performance. As a result, fun-
damental deep learning methods experienced a period akin to the Ice Age. The remarkable
historical TSF models mentioned above are organized chronologically in Fig. 8.
3.3 The prominence of transformer-based models
Transformer (Vaswani et al 2017), is an innovative model designed to perform com-
plex sequence-to-sequence tasks in natural language processing. This model features an
encoder–decoder structure and utilizes a self-attention mechanism to capture the relation-
ships between tokens in the input sequence.
Modeling approaches in self-attention can be broadly categorized into unidirectional
and bidirectional paradigms. Unidirectional modeling restricts the self-attention mecha-
nism to consider only the tokens preceding the current token in the sequence. For a
sequence (x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x L ), the attention for token x t is computed over the subsequence
(x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x t ) to ensure causality, where L denotes the length of the input sequence. The
unidirectional modeling is predominantly employed in tasks requiring sequential genera-
tion, such as language generation (Brown et al 2020; Dai et al 2019). In contrast, bidi-
rectional modeling allows the self-attention mechanism to utilize the entire sequence. For
token x t, attention is computed over (x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x L ), thereby leveraging both preceding
and succeeding tokens. The bidirectional modeling is employed in tasks requiring holistic
context, such as masked token prediction (Devlin et al 2019; Clark et al 2020).
As a result, Transformers have gained significant attention for replacing fundamental
RNN-based models, offering parallel processing capabilities, and effectively addressing
long-term dependency issues. Transformers’ success with sequential data naturally led to
their extension into time series applications. The attention mechanism plays a significant
role in TSF by considering the relationships across all time steps simultaneously, giving
more weight to important moments, and effectively learning the trends and patterns in the
data.
This section explores various Transformer variants that address the limitations of the
original Transformer for time series forecasting tasks. It discusses the background of
these variants, how they improve upon the original Transformer, and the reasons for their
Fig. 8 Remarkable historical TSF models
1 3

216 Page 26 of 95 J. Kim et al.
enhanced performance in time series prediction. Additionally, it addresses the remaining
limitations of these variant models.
3.3.1 Transformer variants
In recent years, substantial research has focused on transformer-based time series analysis,
particularly long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), which has led to the development
of various models (Zeng et al 2023). The original Transformer model has several limita-
tions when applied to long-term time series forecasting (TSF). These limitations include
quadratic time and memory complexity, as well as error accumulation caused by the auto-
regressive decoder design. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of self-attention
increases quadratically with the length of the input sequence, denoted as O(L2), where L
represents the length of the input sequence.
This high complexity can become a computational bottleneck, especially for time series
forecasting tasks that rely on long-term historical information. To address these issues,
Transformer variants primarily focus on reducing time and memory complexity. BAn
attention pattern determines which tokens a token attends to. Figure 9 compares Full Self-
Attention and Sparse Self-Attention patterns to illustrate the efficiency of Sparse Attention
(Beltagy et al 2020). In Fig. 9a, all tokens attend to each other, sharing global information.
In contrast, Fig. 9b shows that only a subset of tokens is attended to, reducing computational
cost while preserving essential information.
LogTrans (Li et al 2019) leverages the efficiency of Log Sparse attention mechanisms to
reduce time and memory complexity to O(LlogL), making it well-suited for long sequence
forecasting tasks. This model assumes recent data is more relevant than older data, utilizing
positional sparsity to focus attention only on relevant data. Reformer (Kitaev et al 2020)
enhances efficiency through locality-sensitive hashing and reversible residual layers, reduc-
ing memory and computational requirements to O(LlogL) while maintaining performance
on long sequences. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) approximates attention by cluster-
ing similar items and performing attention partially on these clusters. Informer (Zhou et al
2021) improves computational and memory efficiency to O(LlogL) by utilizing a Prob-
Sparse self-attention mechanism and a generative-style decoder. It effectively handles long
sequences and captures dependencies across various time scales. Informer addresses the
Fig. 9 BComparison of full and sparse self-attention patterns

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 27 of 95 216
limitations of Reformer, which performs well only on extremely long sequences, and Log-
Trans, which uses heuristic positional-based attention. ProbSparse self-attention features
dynamic query selection based on query sparsity measurement. Autoformer (Wu et al 2021)
integrates time series decomposition into the internal blocks of the Transformer and uti-
lizes an auto-correlation mechanism to aggregate similar sub-series. Autoformer improves
upon previous methods by addressing point-wise dependency and aggregation issues. It
employs a decomposition architecture to handle complex temporal patterns by separating
seasonal and trend components. Pyraformer (Liu et al 2021a) introduces a novel pyramid
attention mechanism designed to efficiently model long-term dependencies in time series
data. By using a hierarchical structure to progressively reduce sequence length, Pyraformer
significantly lowers computational complexity compared to fundamental Transformer mod-
els. Fedformer (Zhou et al 2022) combines Fourier-enhanced decomposition blocks with
frequency domain sparse representations, integrating seasonal-trend decomposition from
Autoformer and offering a more effective representation of time series data. The sparse
representation basis can be Fourier-based or Wavelet-based, encompassing a subset of fre-
quency components, including both high and low frequencies. Additionally, attempts have
been made to overcome the limitations of normalized Transformers, which often produce
indistinguishable attention patterns and fail to capture significant temporal dependencies.
Non-stationary Transformer (Liu et al 2022) identifies this issue as excessive normalization
and addresses it with De-stationary Attention, which allows for the use of non-normalized
data during QKV computations.
3.3.2 Limitation of transformer-based models
However, even the models designed specifically for time series forecasting based on the
original Transformer still have the following limitations.
Efficiency challenges
Efforts to overcome the primary drawback of quadratic scaling in computational and
memory complexity with window length have not fully resolved the issues. Various
approaches to reduce this complexity have been proposed, but the attention mechanism
inherently incurs higher computational and memory costs compared to MLP-based or con-
volutional models with O(L) complexity. Applying Transformers to the time domain does
not easily mitigate this problem. Models such as Fedformer (Zhou et al 2022), which uses
Fourier or Wavelet transformations to operate in the frequency domain, have been made
to address these issues. Although research into more efficient attention variants is ongo-
ing (Tay et al 2020), these solutions often sacrifice some of the effective characteristics
of Transformers. Sparse attention mechanisms, used to reduce Self-Attention complexity,
may result in the omission of important information. Models like LogTrans and Pyraformer
introduce explicit sparsity biases in the attention mechanism but may suffer from significant
performance degradation due to the loss of crucial information. None of these variants have
yet been proven effective across diverse domains (Gu and Dao 2024).
Context window limited to current input
In principle, Transformers can handle inputs of arbitrary length, provided there are suf-
ficient computational resources. However, transformers must process the entire context at
once in a single input, causing the memory and computation requirements to grow substan-
tially with longer context length. By contrast, RNNs and State Space Models (SSMs) main-
1 3

216 Page 28 of 95 J. Kim et al.
tain hidden states over time, allowing them to preserve context beyond the immediate input.
We highlight this practical limitation, which often arises when handling very long contexts.
Ineffectiveness of expanding input window length
Another significant issue is the minimal or no performance improvement observed when
increasing the input window length. Strong time series forecasting (TSF) models are gener-
ally expected to achieve better results with larger look-back window sizes due to their robust
temporal relationship extraction capabilities. However, research (Zeng et al 2023; Zhou et al
2021; Wen et al 2023) indicates that the performance of Transformers either deteriorates or
remains stable as the look-back window increases, in contrast to improvements seen with
linear-based methods (Zeng et al 2023). This suggests that transformer-based models tend to
overfit noise rather than extract long-term temporal information when provided with longer
sequences.
In conclusion, while transformer-based models have made significant advancements in
time series forecasting, they still face limitations. Therefore, future research will continue to
address these limitations and will also serve as a catalyst for re-exploring various alternative
architectures.
3.4 Uprising of non-transformer-based models
As previously discussed, transformer-based models demonstrate strong performance in pro-
cessing time series data. However, they have several limitations when dealing with long-
term time series data.
● The point-wise operations of the self-attention mechanism have quadratic time com-
plexity. Therefore, as sequence length increases, the computational load grows expo-
nentially, making it challenging to handle long-term historical information.
● Because storing the relationship information for all input token pairs requires substan-
tial memory usage, applying Transformers in environments with limited GPU memory
becomes challenging.
● When the length of the look-back window exceeds the structural capacity, learning
long-term dependencies becomes challenging.
● Due to the high complexity of the model, large-scale and high-quality datasets are re-
quired. In the absence of sufficient data, overfitting can occur leading to a drop in model
performance.
Contemporary TSF tasks increasingly require the prediction of diverse multivariates and
long sequences. Unlike earlier tasks that involved relatively short sequences, the limita-
tions of transformer-based models have become more pronounced when dealing with long
sequences. Researchers adhering to the Transformer’s philosophy have begun focusing
intensively on two aspects to address these issues: reducing computational complexity and
enhancing long-term dependency learning. Conversely, some researchers have reverted to
non-transformer methodologies, renewing interest in fundamental deep learning models
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 29 of 95 216
such as RNNs, CNNs, GNNs, and MLPs. Non-transformer-based models have the poten-
tial to overcome the limitations of Transformers, and research has begun to leverage these
strengths to move beyond the hegemony of the Transformer backbone.
RNN-based models sequentially process input data, retaining the previous state at each
time step to predict the next state. This enables the natural modeling of long-term depen-
dencies and helps overcome the limitations of Transformers by leveraging time-ordering
learning. They require relatively less data and memory, making them less restrictive in their
application. Additionally, their ability to handle real-time streaming data enhances their ver-
satility across various applications.
Convolution operations in CNN-based models offer lower time complexity and reduced
memory requirements compared to the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. Since
time series data often exhibit periodic trends and seasonality, the ability of convolution to
extract local patterns complements Transformers’ specialization in learning global patterns,
addressing their shortcomings.
GNN-based models can effectively represent and learn the complex relationships and
structures of time series data through nodes and edges. They integrate localities efficiently
through local operations, resulting in lower memory usage. Additionally, their ability to
model both spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously makes them advantageous for
handling multivariate datasets.
The primary advantage of MLP-based models lies in their simple structure, which facili-
tates efficient training, fast inference, and straightforward handling. Current AI models
require lightweight designs suitable for mobile applications, and MLP-based models are
well-suited for environments with many constraints.
Especially, the counterattack of simple linear models based on MLPs is one of the nota-
ble trend shifts. The emergence of LTSF-Linear (Zeng et al 2023) models which surpass
transformer-based models using only simple linear layers has triggered this change. One
of the key characteristics of time series data is that the time ordering of data points holds
important meaning. Conversely, the permutation-invariant nature of the Transformer’s
attention mechanism, which emphasizes relationships between data points, is argued to be
inherently unsuitable for time series data. Although positional embedding attempts to pre-
serve time order, the multi-head attention process inevitably leads to information loss (Zhou
et al 2021).
LTSF-Linear models highlighted the critical limitations of Transformers in handling long
sequences, demonstrating that simple linear models could better preserve time-ordering
information and extract features related to trends and seasonality.
This claim gained further traction through subsequent studies, leading to a more diversi-
fied interest in backbone models across various architectures. The emergence of this model
sparked skepticism regarding the performance of Transformer-based models and served as
a catalyst for the exploration of various alternative architectures. The era of Transformer
prevalence has come to an end, ushering in a renaissance in time series research, character-
ized by a reevaluation of fundamental DNNs, the emergence of novel models like Mamba,
and new approaches such as the utilization of LMMs.

4 New exploration of TSF models
4.1 Overcoming limitations of transformer
As previously mentioned in 3.4, the performance of simple linear models in LTSF-Lin-
ear (Zeng et al 2023) surpassing fundamental transformer-based models has raised doubts
about the effectiveness of Transformers. However, in the field of NLP, Transformers still
demonstrate superior performance in handling long-term dependencies in sequential data
compared to other models (Patwardhan et al 2023). This observation suggests that while
Transformers have great potential, researchers have not fully leveraged their capabilities in
time series analysis.
Therefore, various methods have emerged in time series forecasting to overcome the
limitations of existing Transformer-based models. This section categorizes and explains in
detail the specific limitations of existing models and how these limitations are addressed.
The structure begins with an introduction to the patching technique, followed by the use of
cross-dimension and exogenous variables, and then provides a detailed explanation of other
approaches, concluding with a summary of key points in Table 5.
4.1.1 Patching technique
Transformers were originally developed for natural language processing (NLP), and apply-
ing them to time-series analysis requires appropriate adjustments to fit the domain of time
series. Different from the rich semantic information carried by individual word tokens in
NLP, individual data points in time series are often similar to their neighboring values, lack-
ing substantial information (Nie et al 2023). Therefore, the point-wise attention mechanism
of fundamental models fails to consider the broader context or patterns that may span mul-
tiple consecutive time steps and only calculates attention for individual time steps, which
makes it difficult to capture the characteristics of time series data. For this reason, consider-
ing the surrounding context along with a single time point provides more information in
time series data.
Patching refers to the technique of dividing input sequences into multiple patches, as
illustrated in Fig. 10. This method preserves the information within each patch, thereby
enhancing locality. By processing patches instead of individual points, the model processes
fewer tokens, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.
This approach helps overcome the issue of prediction performance degradation, which can
occur when sparse attention is used to make self-attention more efficient, potentially miss-
ing critical information.
PatchTST (Nie et al 2023), inspired by Vision Transformer’s (Dosovitskiy et al 2021)
division of images into 16 16 patches for capturing local semantic information, divides
×
time series into 64 patches. This approach allows for utilizing a longer look-back window
by grouping data into patches. By processing time-series data in patch units, PatchTST
maximizes the advantages of Transformer models for time-series applications, achieving
better performance than LTSF-Linear. PatchTST employs only the Transformer encoder,
flattens the encoder output, and uses a linear layer for the final predictions. Additionally,
the study shows that channel independence (CI) yields better performance, highlighting
the limitations in learning channel correlations despite the intuitive consideration of chan-

nel dependencies (CD) in multivariate scenarios. MTST (Zhang et al 2024e) addresses the
limitation of PatchTST in learning patterns across different scales present in time-series
data. By adopting a multi-scale approach, MTST proposes an effective model utilizing both
shorter and longer patches for locality and long-term trend analysis. PETformer (Lin et al
2024c) critiques the flattening of Transformer encoder output in PatchTST, which results in
a significant increase in parameters. PETformer introduces a placeholder-enhanced tech-
nique, modeling past and future data on the same time scale, thereby reducing the number
1 3

Fig. 10 Patching technique in self-attention for time series forecasting
of parameters by over 95% compared to PatchTST. This reduction enhances generalization
performance while using less memory and computational resources. The model also lever-
ages rich context information by allowing direct interaction between past and future data,
maintaining the continuity of time-series data.
By applying the patching technique, it was possible to refute the notion that traditional
linear models are superior to Transformers. This led to the patching technique becoming a
widely adopted approach.
4.1.2 Cross-dimension
In multivariate time-series forecasting, understanding the relationships between variables is
crucial for improving prediction accuracy. Intuitively, higher temperatures lead to increased
ice cream sales, indicating a relationship between variables. Despite this apparent correla-
tion, surprising results have shown that models treating channels independently, such as
LTSF-Linear, PatchTST, and PETformer, often outperform those considering inter-channel
correlations. This result implies that current models fail to effectively capture the relation-
ships between variables. Time series analysis differs significantly from natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) in terms of channel correlation. In NLP, there
is no clear concept of channels. In CV, although channels exist, their relationships are tightly
intertwined and well-defined, as seen in the RGB representation of images.
Conversely, in time series analysis, channel relationships can be either independent or
interdependent and often hidden, adding complexity to the task. Therefore, time series
analysis requires models capable of capturing these intricate correlations. While earlier
Transformer-based models primarily focused on temporal attention, recent models have
increasingly focused on explicitly modeling the correlations between variables.
Figure 11 illustrates the explicit modeling of relationships between variables using the
attention mechanism.
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 33 of 95 216
Fig. 11 Cross-dimensional self-attention for modeling variable relationships
The overall progression of advancements is as follows. It begins with modeling that
explicitly accounts for correlations between variables. This progresses to directly model-
ing the relationships between both temporal and variable aspects. Additionally, the model
incorporates the possibility of time lags in the relationships between variables, allowing it
to flexibly learn dependencies.
Crossformer (Zhang and Yan 2023) breaks away from solely temporal attention by
employing a Two-Stage Attention mechanism that sequentially processes Cross-Time and
Cross-Dimension stages. It divides each dimension’s time series into patches, embeds them
into 2D vectors, and performs attention. Crossformer incorporates a router mechanism in
the Cross-Dimension stage to handle the increased complexity of dual attention. This hier-
archical structure across multiple scales enables Crossformer to effectively model both tem-
poral dependencies and inter-dimensional correlations, significantly enhancing multivariate
time series forecasting performance. DSformer (Yu et al 2023) criticizes Crossformer for
emphasizing global interactions between variables in time series data, while overlooking
the importance of local information, such as short-term variations and patterns. DSformer
addresses this by using double sampling, obtaining global information via downsampling
and local information through piecewise sampling. These samples undergo parallel tempo-
ral variable attention, allowing the model to integrate global, local, and inter-variable cor-
relations in multivariate time series data through dual sampling and time-variable attention
mechanisms. CARD (Wang et al 2024b) points out the structural complexity and high com-
putational cost of Crossformer’s hierarchical attention mechanism. Simplifying the struc-
ture, CARD employs only the encoder and uses a lightweight token blend module instead
of explicitly generating token hierarchies. This module merges adjacent tokens to represent
larger ranges, efficiently leveraging multi-scale information and enhancing prediction accu-
racy. A robust loss function is introduced to prevent overfitting, adjusting weights to favor
near-future data over far-future data, which shows less temporal correlation. iTransformer
(Liu et al 2024c) innovatively reverses the time and variable dimensions in the standard
Transformer model, learning inter-variable correlations. By embedding each variable into
1 3

216 Page 34 of 95 J. Kim et al.
variate tokens via a Transformer encoder and performing temporal predictions through a
feed-forward network, iTransformer surprisingly outperforms Crossformer, highlighting the
limitations of merely adding explicit channel attention. Its advantage lies in not needing to
alter the original Transformer structure. VCformer (Yang et al 2024b) addresses the issue
of neglecting time lags in variable correlations. Its variable correlation attention module
calculates cross-correlation scores between queries and keys across various lags using FFT
(Fast Fourier Transform), efficiently exploring and adaptively integrating correlations for
each lag. GridTST (Cheng et al 2024c) transforms time series data into a grid format, apply-
ing horizontal and vertical attention mechanisms to model time and variable correlations
effectively. Like PatchTST and iTransformer, GridTST leverages the original Transformer,
distinguishing itself from the more complex Crossformer. It experiments with three con-
figurations: time-first, channel-first, and cross-application, finding that prioritizing channel
attention yields the best performance, aligning with human intuitive analysis of inter-vari-
able relationships. UniTST (Liu et al 2024b) critiques the inability of cross-time and cross-
dimension attention methods to directly and explicitly learn complex inter-variable and
intra-variable dependencies. It proposes a unified attention mechanism by flattening patch
tokens. To mitigate the increased computational cost, UniTST incorporates a dispatcher
module to reduce memory complexity and enhance model feasibility. DeformTime (Shu
and Lampos 2024) introduces deformable attention, dynamically adjusting to recognize and
adapt to important data features instead of fixed attention areas. Parallel deformable atten-
tion mechanisms within the Transformer encoder capture correlations between variables
and time, adaptively extracting critical information across various time intervals and vari-
able combinations, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalizability.
4.1.3 Exogenous variable
Most existing research primarily utilizes endogenous variables for prediction. However,
in real-world scenarios, relying solely on endogenous variables can be insufficient due to
the complexity of various influencing factors. For instance, stock price predictions are sig-
nificantly affected by external factors such as economic indicators, political changes, and
technological advancements. Ignoring these external factors and relying only on past data of
endogenous variables can lead to failures in accurately predicting market volatility. There-
fore, incorporating exogenous variables as supplementary information has emerged as a
method to improve prediction performance.
TimeXer (Wang et al 2024c) proposes a method to integrate exogenous variables into the
canonical Transformer model without structural changes. It operates by dividing the time
series data of endogenous variables into patches, learning the temporal dependencies of
each patch through self-attention. Then, it generates variate tokens summarizing the entire
series of endogenous and exogenous variables and learns their interactions using a cross-
attention mechanism. Through this process, TimeXer simultaneously considers the temporal
patterns of endogenous variables and the impact of exogenous variables, enabling more pre-
cise and in-depth time-series predictions. However, TimeXer requires manual identification
and input of appropriate exogenous variables. If unsuitable data is provided, it can hinder
the model’s predictive accuracy. TGTSF (Xu et al 2024b) integrates text data from channel
descriptions and news messages to enhance prediction accuracy. It embeds channel descrip-
tions and news messages using a pre-trained text model, transforming them into a sequence
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 35 of 95 216
of vectors over time. The cross-attention layer then calculates the relevance of the text to
each channel. By incorporating text data into the time series prediction model, TGTSF not
only improves prediction accuracy but also allows for direct comparison of the impact of
textual information on predictive performance.
4.1.4 Additional approaches
Beyond the topics discussed above, there are various other approaches to time series
forecasting.
Generalization
Research has been conducted to improve model generalization, avoid overfitting, and
achieve consistent performance across diverse datasets. SAMformer (Ilbert et al 2024)
addresses the issue of self-attention mechanisms converging to sharp local minima, causing
entropy collapse during training, and demonstrates that applying SAM (Sharpness-Aware
Minimization) can significantly enhance performance. Minusformer (Liang et al 2024b)
highlights the redundancy and overfitting caused by a large number of parameters in Trans-
formers. To combat this, it employs a boosting ensemble method, where each subsequent
model predicts the residuals of the previous model’s outputs, thus reducing redundancy and
improving generalization.
Multi-scale
The multi-scale approach extracts more information from time series data across vari-
ous scales, offering distinct advantages. Scaleformer (Shabani et al 2023) proposes a gen-
eral framework by stacking existing models across different scales, resulting in improved
performance. Pathformer (Chen et al 2024b), on the other hand, allows the model to learn
adaptive scales independently, rather than relying on fixed scales.
Decoder-only
Large-scale language models (LLMs) like LLaMA3 (Dubey et al 2024) have been suc-
cessfully implemented using only a decoder without the need for an encoder. The decoder-
only architecture is simpler and involves less complex computations, resulting in faster
training and inference. Additionally, the decoder-only structure helps avoid the temporal
information loss often associated with the self-attention mechanism in encoders. This has
led to a research proposal aimed at improving performance in time series forecasting using
a decoder-only structure. CATS (Kim et al 2024) addresses the high time and memory com-
plexity of self-attention in Transformer encoders and the loss of temporal order informa-
tion. It proposes a structure using only cross-attention, focusing solely on the relationship
between future and past data with a decoder-only architecture, which reduces parameter
count and enhances efficiency. In contrast to the encoder-only structure of most models dis-
cussed CATS demonstrates the effectiveness of using only the decoder in achieving superior
performance.
Feature enhancement
Fredformer (Piao et al 2024) identifies the issue of frequency bias in time series data,
where learning tends to focus disproportionately on either low or high frequencies. It
addresses this by normalizing the frequencies to eliminate bias. Basisformer (Ni et al 2024)
proposes a method to construct flexible relationships with each time series by leveraging
biases learned through contrastive learning.

4.2 Growth of fundamental deep learning models
Since the advent of simple linear models, there has been a surge in research focused on
non-transformer-based models. Attention has shifted to various architectures such as MLP,
RNN, CNN, and GNN, with many models surpassing Transformers and achieving remark-
able performance improvements. Although transformer-based models exhibit excellent per-
formance across numerous fields, they have structural limitations in learning temporal order
information, which is crucial for time series problems. While past tasks were simple and
general enough to overlook these limitations, current real-world tasks involve many con-
straints and data-specific issues with diverse variables, necessitating approaches from vari-
ous perspectives. Each architecture has its own strengths, and these characteristics provide
valuable solutions for addressing diverse contemporary time series forecasting challenges.
In this section, we will investigate the latest major models for each architecture and analyze
their technical features. The key characteristics of each backbone architecture have been
briefly summarized in comparison to Transformers in Table 6.
4.2.1 MLP-based models
MLP-based models have recently emerged as a key methodology for replacing Transform-
ers in time series forecasting tasks. The simple structure of MLPs makes them easy to han-
dle and interpret. Additionally, they perform well even in constrained environments with
limited computational resources and limited data. Their lightweight architectures enable fast
training and inference, making them increasingly important and widely used in contempo-
rary industries. Previously, interest in MLPs diminished due to their structural limitations,
such as the lack of sequential dependency, challenges with long-term dependency, diffi-
culties in processing high-dimensional data, and limitations in capturing periodic patterns.
However, recent advancements have enabled long-sequence learning and various technical
enhancements, leading to remarkable performance improvements.
N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al 2020), consisting of simple Fully Connected (FC) layers, dem-
onstrated superior performance compared to traditional statistical models. This model uti-
lizes a block-based architecture with repeatedly stacked backcast and forecast paths and
enhances generalization performance through ensemble learning. By applying decomposi-
tion, it separates trend and seasonality, modeling them using Polynomial Basis and Fourier
Basis, respectively, making it highly interpretable. BMoreover, recent studies have improved
the N-BEATS model to predict various quantiles, enabling probabilistic forecasting (Smyl
et al 2024). The improved N-HiTS (Challu et al 2023) model can handle multivariate data
and overcomes the limitations of N-BEATS by employing techniques such as multi-rate
signal sampling, non-linear regression, and hierarchical interpolation. Koopa (Liu et al
2024d) is a model designed to effectively handle non-stationary time series data by utilizing
Koopman theory to predict the dynamic changes of components. It uses a Fourier filter to
separate time-invariant and time-variant elements, which are then fed into respective Koop-
man predictors(KP). In KP, nonlinear time series data are linearly transformed, making
them easier to manage. To effectively capture the characteristics of each component, the
time-invariant KP uses a globally learned Koopman operator, while the time-variant KP
computes a local operator for predictions. TSMixer (Ekambaram et al 2023) is a lightweight
patch-based model that introduces the MLP-mixer from the computer vision field to the
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 37 of 95 216
time-series domain. It efficiently learns long-term and short-term dependencies through
inter-patch and intra-patch mixers respectively, and explicitly learns channel relationships
through an inter-channel mixer. To enhance the understanding of inter-channel correlations,
it adjusts the original forecast results using reconciliation heads and employs gated attention
to filter important features. By introducing these techniques, TSMixer upgrades the simple
MLP structure, resulting in improved performance that outperforms complex Transformer
models. FreTS (Yi et al 2024) is a model that leverages two key characteristics of the fre-
quency domain-global view and energy compaction-to directly train an MLP model in the
frequency domain. While existing models primarily use frequency transformation to verify
the periodicity of the model, this model distinguishes between channel and temporal depen-
dencies in the frequency domain as real and imaginary parts, respectively, and learns them
directly to better extract hidden features. TSP (Wang et al 2024e) utilizes a PrecMLP block
with a precurrent mechanism to effectively model temporal locality and channel depen-
dency. The precurrent mechanism combines previous information with current information
to create hybrid features at each time point, serving as a computationally-free method to
effectively recognize and process temporal locality. This lightweight MLP model comprises
an encoder, consisting of tMLP operating in the time dimension and vMLP operating in the
variable dimension, and a decoder using a linear model. FITS (Xu et al 2024c) is a very
lightweight model with fewer than 10,000 parameters, yet it demonstrates competitive per-
formance comparable to larger models. It performs interpolation through a complex linear
layer that learns amplitude scaling and phase shifts in the frequency domain, thereby
expanding the frequency representation of the input time series. By using a low-pass filter
to remove high-frequency components, which are often noise, the model efficiently repre-
sents the data and reduces the number of learnable parameters. U-Mixer (Ma et al 2024)
utilizes a hierarchical structure of U-Net’s encoder–decoder composed of MLPs to extract
and combine low-dimensional and high-dimensional features. Each MLP block processes
temporal dependencies and channel interactions separately, enabling stable feature extrac-
tion. Additionally, the model employs a stationary correction method to limit the differences
in data distribution before and after processing, thereby restoring the non-stationary infor-
mation of the data. By calculating the transformation matrix and mean difference between
the input and output data, the model adjusts the output to maintain temporal dependency,
thereby enhancing its prediction performance. TTMs (Ekambaram et al 2024) is a time
series foundation model that uses TSMixer as its backbone and relies solely on time series
data for rapid pre-training. This model is trained on the extensive collection of time series
datasets with diverse channels and resolutions from the Monash archive (Table 3). Despite
the data-specific characteristics of the time series datasets, TTMs demonstrate efficient
transfer learning and high generalization performance. TimeMixer (Wang et al 2024a) lever-
ages the observation that time series data exhibit distinct patterns at different sampling
scales. To extract important information from past data, multi-scale time series are gener-
ated through downsampling. In the Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) block, the seasonal
and trend components are decomposed and mixed separately. The Future-Multipredictor-
Mixing (FMM) block then integrates predictions by ensembling multiple predictors, which
utilize the past information extracted at various scales. CATS (Lu et al 2024) enhances the
performance of multivariate time series forecasting by generating Auxiliary Time Series
(ATS) from the Original Time Series (OTS) and integrating them into the prediction pro-

objectives, combining them to maximize predictive performance. To effectively generate
and utilize ATS, the model structure and loss function incorporate three key principles: con-
tinuity, sparsity, and variability. Despite using a simple two-layer MLP predictor as the
foundation, CATS effectively predicts multivariate information through the use of ATS.
HDMixer (Huang et al 2024a) is a model that applies a Length-Extendable Patcher to over-
come the limitations of fixed-length patching. It measures the point-wise similarity with
fixed patches and compares the patch entropy loss, updating parameters to increase the
complexity of the extendable patches. Through the Hierarchical Dependency Explorer
mixer, it learns long-term, short-term dependencies and cross-variable dependencies.
SOFTS (Han et al 2024) proposes the STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) Module to effec-
tively learn the relationships between channels. It converts the data from each channel into
high-dimensional vectors and then aggregates these vectors to extract comprehensive infor-
mation, referred to as the core. The generated core representation is then combined with the
time series representation of each channel and converted back to the time series dimension,
reducing complexity and enhancing robustness. SparseTSF (Lin et al 2024b) is an extremely
lightweight model that uses fewer than 1,000 parameters while demonstrating excellent
generalization performance. It downsamples the data into multiple periods, performs pre-
dictions on each generated sub-sequence, and then upsamples to create the overall predic-
tion sequence. While it shows limited performance only on data with clear periodic patterns,
it efficiently handles complex temporal dependencies with minimal computational resources.
TEFN (Zhan et al 2024) proposes a novel backbone model from the perspective of informa-
tion fusion to extract latent distributions from simple data structures. Based on evidence
theory (Shafer 1976), the Basic Probability Assignment Module maps each time and chan-
nel dimension of the time series data to a mass function in the event space. This mass func-
tion assigns probabilities to multiple possibilities for each data point, allowing for explicit
modeling of uncertainty. The generated mass functions are fused using their expected values
to derive the final predictions. This model achieves high predictive performance with few
parameters and fast training times. PDMLP (Tang and Zhang 2024) surpasses the perfor-
mance of complex transformer-based models using only simple linear layers and patching.
It divides the data into patches of various scales and embeds each patch with a single linear
layer. The embedding vectors are then decomposed into smooth components and residual
components containing noise, allowing the model to process the sequences in two ways:
intra-variable and inter-variable. AMD (Hu et al 2024b) introduces the AMS block, which
assesses the importance of various temporal patterns and generates appropriate weights for
each pattern. By simultaneously modeling the temporal and channel dependencies of the
input information decomposed into multiple scales, it effectively captures interactions at
different scales. Instead of merely integrating the results from each scale, it improves pre-
diction performance by reflecting the importance of each pattern through the weights.
4.2.2 CNN-based models
CNNs were primarily developed for image recognition and processing tasks because they
are highly effective at identifying 2D spatial patterns. Some studies have begun utilizing
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), which are 1D CNNs that move along the time
axis to recognize local patterns, effectively extracting key features of time series data. Addi-
tionally, CNNs can use filters of various sizes to capture patterns at multiple scales, allowing
1 3

them to effectively learn both short-term and long-term patterns in time series data. CNN’s
deep network technology and parallelism, which have been developed over a long period of
time, have provided high performance and reliability for time series forecasting. However,
the fixed filter size of CNNs lacks flexibility in learning complex patterns of long sequences
and poses challenges in capturing long-term dependencies. Furthermore, as the network
depth increases, there are limitations such as information loss, increased computational cost,
and higher memory usage. For these reasons, the relatively flexible Transformer, which is
advantageous for learning long-term dependencies, has gained more attention in time series
data processing. However, due to their superior ability to capture diverse local patterns
within long sequences, CNNs are once again receiving attention as a backbone architecture.
Recently, 3D convolution methodologies have been actively studied for handling com-
plex spatio-temporal time series data (Chen et al 2021c; Feng et al 2024a). 3D convolution
processes input data in three dimensions (2D spatial axes + temporal axis) using convo-
lution operations. This approach enables the extraction of richer patterns by processing
not only the temporal axis but also spatial or multi-dimensional aspects of the data. Such
methods have demonstrated high performance in region-based prediction tasks, and future
research is expected to focus on developing more sophisticated data representations and
learning structures.
TimesNet (Wu et al 2023) introduces the TimesBlock, which embeds 1D time series
into 2D tensors for analysis to effectively capture multi-periodicity. Extracting key frequen-
cies via Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) expands the data into a 2D tensor, representing
intra-period variation in columns and inter-period variation in rows. It uses a parameter-
efficient Inception module with 2D kernels to capture temporal variations across various
scales. After converting back to a 1D tensor, it adaptively aggregates the data based on
the importance of frequency amplitude values. PatchMixer (Gong et al 2023) introduces a
patch-mixing design to efficiently replace the permutation invariant property of the Trans-
former’s attention mechanism. It learns intra-patch correlations using single-scale depth-
wise separable convolutions and inter-patch correlations using point-wise convolutions on
the patched input sequence. ModernTCN (Luo and Wang 2024) enhances the fundamen-
tal TCNs to make them more suitable for time series analysis. Using larger kernels than
conventional TCNs expands the effective receptive field, reducing the number of layers
and effectively capturing long-term dependencies. It separates depth-wise convolution and
point-wise convolution to independently learn temporal dependencies and feature depen-
dencies, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Additionally, it explicitly handles
cross-variable dependency in multivariate time series data, resulting in improved perfor-
mance. ConvTimeNet (Cheng et al 2024b) follows the framework of a Transformer encoder,
replacing the role of self-attention with depthwise convolution and the role of multi-head
attention with convolutions of various kernel sizes to increase computational efficiency. It
uses Deformable Patch Embedding, which adaptively adjusts each patch’s size and posi-
tion based on the data. Depthwise convolutions capture temporal features for each chan-
nel, while point-wise convolutions model channel dependencies. ACNet (Zhang and Wang
2024) aims to effectively model temporal dependencies and nonlinear features. It starts by
removing unnecessary noise from the data using Wavelet Denoising. Then, it extracts tem-
poral features through Multi-Resolution Dilated Convolution and Global Adaptive Average
Pooling. To more accurately capture nonlinear features, Gated Deformable Convolution is
employed, which adaptively adjusts the sampling positions. Additionally, ACNet employs
1 3

dynamic prediction, retraining the model with new data if prediction performance declines.
FTMixer (Li et al 2024d) leverages the observation that the time domain effectively captures
local dependencies while the frequency domain excels at learning global dependencies. It
applies convolution in the frequency domain to capture global dependencies. Meanwhile, it
converts multi-scale patches using Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT), which is com-
putationally simpler than Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), and then applies convolu-
tion to capture local dependencies.
4.2.3 RNN-based models
RNNs were fundamentally developed to process sequential data. Their recurrent structure
can effectively model the temporal dependencies of time series data. Gated RNN mod-
els, such as LSTM and GRU, have partially alleviated the long-term dependency issues of
vanilla RNNs. However, RNNs are difficult to parallelize because they process data sequen-
tially. This slow speed is particularly detrimental when handling long sequences. RNNs
also have inherent limitations in learning long-term dependencies and global information.
Transformers have effectively addressed these issues through self-attention mechanisms.
However, unlike Transformers, which rely on large datasets, RNN-based models can learn
effectively with smaller amounts of data. They also use memory efficiently and are well-
suited for real-time data processing due to their sequential nature, making them advanta-
geous for online streaming applications. Additionally, because time ordering is naturally
learned, RNNs still have inherent advantages over Transformers for time series processing.
PA-RNN (Zhang et al 2024c) aims to address prediction Uncertainty Quantification and
Model Compression issues for dependent time series data by proposing an optimization
methodology for Sparse Deep Learning. It applies a Mixture of Gaussian Prior to introduc-
ing sparsity to the parameters and uses a Prior Annealing technique to gradually increase
the strength of the prior distribution during the training process. Properties such as Poste-
rior Consistency, Structure Selection Consistency, and Asymptotic Normality ensure the
model’s theoretical validity. WITRAN (Jia et al 2024) proposes a new paradigm by imple-
menting information transmission in bi-granular flows to capture long-term and short-term
repetitive patterns. It models global and local correlations through the Horizontal Vertical
Gated Selective Unit (HVGSU), which uses bidirectional Gated Selective Cells (GSC). To
enhance the efficiency of information transmission through parallel processing, it applies the
Recurrent Acceleration Network (RAN). This approach results in excellent prediction per-
formance while reducing time complexity and maintaining memory complexity. SutraNets
(Bergsma et al 2023) transforms long sequences into multiple lower-frequency sub-series
in order to effectively predict long sequence time series data. It performs autoregressive
predictions among the sub-series, with each sub-series being conditionally predicted based
on the values of other sub-series. This approach reduces the signal path length and allows
for the generation of long sequences in fewer steps. Consequently, it mitigates the common
RNN problem of error accumulation and models long-distance dependencies better. Cross-
WaveNet (Huang et al 2024b) uses a dual-channel network to separate and process the sea-
sonality and trend-cyclic components of data. The input data are initially decomposed into
individual elements through series decomposition, and features are extracted using enriched
LSTM and GRU structures. These extracted features undergo a cross-decomposition pro-
cess to further refine the elements, which are then sent to each channel for integration.

Series decomposition is performed at each RNN step, progressively filtering and reinte-
grating the seasonality and trend components to learn precise information. DAN (Li et al
2024c) proposes a new model that utilizes Polar Representation learning to predict long-
term time series data with high volatility. The Distance-weighted Auto-regularized Neural
network (DAN) distinguishes and learns the polar representations of distant and nearby
data, combining them to enhance prediction performance. It addresses the imbalance prob-
lem of extreme data, which occur infrequently but are critical for accurate predictions, using
Kruskal-Wallis Sampling and employs a Multi-Loss Regularization Method to effectively
learn both extreme and normal values simultaneously. RWKV-TS (Hou and Yu 2024) pro-
poses an efficient Recurrent Weighted Key-Value (RWKV) backbone characterized by lin-
ear time complexity and memory usage. It uses a Multi-head Weighted Key-Value (WKV)
Operator, which is similar to the self-attention mechanism but maintains linear time and
space complexity. Each head captures different temporal patterns, increasing the represen-
tational power of the information and enabling parallel computation, thus providing high
computational efficiency. This allows RWKV-TS to capture longer sequence information
more effectively than fundamental RNNs. CONTIME (Jhin et al 2024) introduces Continu-
ous GRU to minimize the prediction delay issue in time series forecasting. This approach
applies Neural ODE to the existing GRU, modeling data changes continuously over time.
The bi-directional structure integrates forward and backward through the time series data,
capturing more accurate temporal dependencies. By employing Time-Derivative Regular-
ization, the model is guided to learn the rate of change in predictions over time, enhancing
both the accuracy and speed of predictions.
4.2.4 GNN-based models
GNNs or GCNs are specialized in processing graph-structured data, being suitable for mod-
eling complex interactions and learning local patterns in time series data. Multivariate time
series data often involve interactions between variables, which can be effectively repre-
sented as relationships between nodes and edges. By assigning various attributes to nodes
and edges, richer representations can be learned, and the structural characteristics of specific
domains can be better reflected. Traditionally, various approaches such as GCN, ST-GCN,
GAT, and TGN have been proposed, contributing to the advancement of the time series
forecasting field.
However, these models primarily focus on learning local information from adjacent
nodes, leading to a lack of capability in learning global information and difficulty in cap-
turing long-term dependencies with distant nodes. The sequential calculation of nodes and
edges makes parallel processing challenging, and the models’ specificity to particular graph
structures reduces their generalization ability. These drawbacks have diminished interest in
GNN-based models. However, with the recent advancements in social networks, much of
current data naturally follows a graph structure. Various optimization techniques and hard-
ware acceleration technologies have been developed, making it possible to process large-
scale graph data. Additionally, the increased practical relevance due to the flexibility in
dynamically handling time-varying data has once again drawn researchers’ attention to this
architecture.
MSGNet (Cai et al 2024a) effectively learns the complex correlations of MTS data by
combining frequency domain analysis with adaptive graph convolution. It uses Fast Fourier
1 3

216 Page 44 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Transformation to identify key periods and transform time series data into various time
scales. Then, it employs Mixhop graph convolution to learn inter-channel correlations and
uses Multi-head Attention and Scale Aggregation to capture intra-series correlations. TMP-
Nets (Coskunuzer et al 2024) is a model proposed to learn features extracted from Temporal
MultiPersistence (TMP) vectorization and capture key topological patterns. It combines two
advanced topological data analysis techniques, Multipersistence and Zigzag Persistence,
to effectively capture topological shape changes in the data. Spatial Graph Convolution
is used to model dependencies between nodes in the graph, and the topological features
extracted with TMP vectors are learned using CNN. HD-TTS (Marisca et al 2024) is a model
that demonstrates high performance even with missing data through masking and hierarchi-
cal downsampling. It incrementally reduces data in the temporal and spatial processing
modules, learning various temporal and spatial dependencies. The model uses an attention
mechanism to learn the patterns of missing values and combines them with weights to gen-
erate the final prediction. ForecastGrapher (Cai et al 2024b) is based on the finding that the
attention mechanism is more suitable for modeling inter-channel correlations than temporal
correlations. Utilizing the similarity between GNN’s neighborhood aggregation and atten-
tion mechanisms, it linearly embeds each channel as a node and learns the relationships
between channels using GNN. Each GNN layer employs a self-learnable adjacency matrix
to independently learn the interactions between nodes. It uses learnable scalers to divide
node features into multiple groups and applies 1D convolution to each group.
4.2.5 Model-agnostic frameworks
Some studies propose model-agnostic methodologies that can be universally applied with-
out being limited to a specific model backbone. These studies focus on the intrinsic charac-
teristics of time series data or specific problems, improving model robustness by addressing
these issues. Model-agnostic architectures, not being tied to a particular model, allow for
flexible selection of the optimal model through various comparisons. They are also highly
reusable and make it easier to interpret and understand the model’s predictions, making
them applicable to a wide range of domains and scenarios.
These models primarily address the distribution shift problem, which is one of the core
issues in time series forecasting, and propose various plug-and-play alleviation methods.
The details related to this will be discussed in Sect. 5, while here, we will focus on other
methodologies, excluding distribution shift alleviation methods.
RobustTSF (Cheng et al 2024a) introduces a selective sampling algorithm to train a
resilient prediction model in Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies (TSFA). It calculates
anomaly scores based on the difference between the trend and the actual data, selecting
samples with scores below a certain threshold to train the model, thereby minimizing the
impact of anomalies. By analyzing three types of anomalies (Constant, Missing, Gaussian),
it identifies the most robust loss function as MAE. This approach addresses the discontinu-
ity issues of the traditional detection-imputation-retraining pipeline, enabling the model to
deliver more stable and consistent performance. PDLS (Hounie et al 2024) proposes a con-
strained learning approach by setting an upper bound on the loss at each time step. It controls
the loss by setting a constant upper bound (ϵ) for all time steps and introduces a variable
(ζ) that relaxes the constraints, allowing automatic adjustment during training. This model
overcomes the problem of existing methodologies that focus on averaging prediction per-
1 3

formance, which often leads to uneven error distributions. Leddam (Yu et al 2024) proposes
two independently usable modules, Learnable Decomposition and Dual Attention, to effec-
tively capture the complex patterns of inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations
in MTS. The Learnable Decomposition module replaces the traditional moving average
kernel with a learnable 1D convolution kernel initialized with a Gaussian distribution for
decomposition, making it more sensitive to critical information. The Dual Attention module
simultaneously models inter-data dependencies and intra-series variability using channel-
wise self-attention and auto-regressive self-attention. InfoTime (Qi et al 2024) proposes
a method to effectively utilize inter-channel and temporal correlations. For channel mix-
ing, it employs Cross-variable Decorrelation Aware feature Modeling (CDAM) to minimize
redundant information between channels and enhance useful mutual information. Addition-
ally, it uses TAM(Temporal correlation Aware Modeling) to maximize the temporal cor-
relations between the predicted future sequence and the target sequence. CCM (Chen et al
2024a) combines the strengths of the traditional channel-independent and channel-depen-
dent strategies to overcome their limitations. It dynamically clusters channels based on their
inherent similarities and learns representative patterns for each cluster to generate prototype
embeddings. Separate FFNs are used for each cluster to perform predictions for the channels
within the cluster, and the prototype embeddings enable zero-shot predictions. HCAN (Sun
et al 2024b) addresses the issue of excessive flattening caused by using the MSE loss func-
tion and proposes reconfiguring the prediction problem as a classification problem to better
learn high-entropy features. It extracts important features from the backbone model, divides
them into multiple layers and categories, and uses an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier at each
layer to reduce uncertainty. It learns relative prediction values within each classified cate-
gory and integrates the prediction results from multiple layers through the Hierarchy-Aware
Attention module. This approach effectively captures the complex patterns and variability
in time series data. TDT Loss (Xiong et al 2024) points out the error accumulation issue in
the traditional auto-regressive approach which recursively models Temporal Dependencies
among Targets (TDT). To effectively capture changes between consecutive time points, it
represents TDT using first-order differencing. The final TDT loss combines the target pre-
diction loss, TDT values prediction loss, and an adaptive weight, allowing the model to
dynamically balance between target prediction and TDT learning. Thus, TDT loss replaces
the optimization objective of non-autoregressive models.
The different deep learning models and their methodologies discussed so far are sum-
marized in Table 7.
4.3 Emergence of foundation models
In recent years, foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance and strong
zero-shot capabilities across various tasks and domains, leading to increased focus (Touvron
et al 2023; Liu et al 2024a; Li et al 2023; Achiam et al 2023; Gallifant et al 2024; Radford
et al 2021). While significant progress has been made in domains like vision and language,
developing foundation models for time series data has faced several challenges. Firstly, time
series data exhibit distinct characteristics depending on the dataset. For instance, electro-
cardiogram (ECG), weather, and sensor data from industrial processes have unique proper-
ties in terms of variables, frequency, periodicity, and noise, often requiring domain-specific
knowledge for effective modeling. Additionally, unlike the vision and language domains,

-: Indicates that the feature is model-agnostic and depends on which backbone model is applied
where large-scale pre-training corpora can be relatively easily constructed from publicly
available sources like the web, collecting time series data is more difficult due to high acqui-
sition costs and security concerns. Despite these obstacles, research on time series founda-
tion models is essential for improving model scalability and generality. This necessity has
led to active exploration in several key directions, particularly in the field of time series
forecasting (Table 8).
4.3.1 Sequence modeling with LLMs
One prominent approach leverages the sequence modeling capabilities of LLMs. LLMs
have revolutionized deep learning with their groundbreaking generalizable sequence mod-
eling. Given the sequential nature of both text and time series data, extending the sequen-
tial capabilities of language models to time series is a natural progression. Early research
includes GPT4TS (Zhou et al 2023), which demonstrates that by freezing most of the lan-
guage model’s backbone and fine-tuning only the layer normalization parameters and posi-
tional embeddings on time series data, GPT4TS can serve as a general time series task solver
for forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. Additionally, PromptCast (Xue and
Salim 2023) introduces a framework where numerical time series sequences are input as
text prompts to a large language model. Then the model outputs the forecasting results in
a question-answering format. This approach integrates domain-specific knowledge through
text and provides forecasting results in a human-friendly format.
Both GPT4TS and PromptCast rely on fine-tuning to achieve their results. In contrast,
without fine-tuning, LLMTime (Gruver et al 2023) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
forecasting capabilities. The main idea of LLMTime is encoding time series data as a string
of numerical digits, which emphasizes the importance of preprocessing and its inherent

dependencies. To align the time series modality with the language modality, Time-LLM (Jin
et al 2024) introduces the concept of patch reprogramming. This concept aims to mitigate
the challenges of a large reprogramming space and attempts to connect time series local
characteristics with language semantics, such as “short up”. While patch reprogramming
offers more flexibility by reducing the reliance on large-scale time series corpora, it also
presents the challenge of adapting time series data to fit the characteristics of large language
models.
4.3.2 Pre-training
Another approach that focuses on building large-scale time series corpora to pre-train time
series foundation models from scratch has emerged. An example is Lag-LLaMA (Rasul et al
2024), which uses a decoder-only Transformer to generate forecasting results, enabling
probabilistic forecasting. Lag-LLaMA also consolidates 27 publicly available forecasting
datasets from various domains to create a comprehensive pre-training corpus. On the other
hand, TimesFM (Das et al 2024) extends beyond publicly available forecasting datasets by
incorporating additional pre-training corpora based on Google Trends and Wiki Pageview
statistics. It also utilizes synthetic datasets generated from piece-wise linear trends, autore-
gressive processes, and sine and cosine functions to capture universal characteristics. The
entire pre-training corpus spans hundreds of billions of time steps. While most of the time
series foundation models rely on temporal embedding, CHRONOS (Ansari et al 2024) takes
a different idea by learning a patch-based tokenizer, similar to conventional language mod-
els, to capture the intrinsic “language” of time series data.
1 3

Conventional foundation models often overlook the relationships between variables in
multivariate time series forecasting, typically extending to multivariate forecasting by inde-
pendently combining univariate forecasts based on channel independence. Uni2TS (Woo
et al 2024) addresses this limitation by explicitly considering the expansion to arbitrary mul-
tivariate time series using variate IDs. Additionally, it leverages a large-scale time series data-
set called LOTSA, which accounts for multi-domain and multi-frequency characteristics.
4.4 Advance of diffusion models
Diffusion models are renowned generative models that have gained prominence for their
ability to produce high-quality images, as demonstrated by DALL-E2 (Ramesh et al 2022),
Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al 2022), and Imagen (Saharia et al 2022). In addition to their
success in image generation, diffusion models have shown excellent performance in various
fields, such as audio generation, natural language processing, and video generation (Cao
et al 2024). Consequently, there has been a growing number of research papers exploring
their application in time series forecasting.
Diffusion models, theoretically proposed by Sohl-Dickstein et al (2015), are inspired by
non-equilibrium statistical physics. They learn by progressively adding noise to the data
and then gradually reversing the process to recover the original data. However, this initial
research lacked concrete methods for training, making practical implementation challeng-
ing. This issue was addressed by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) (Ho
et al 2020) and Noise Conditional Score Networks (NCSN) (Song and Ermon 2019). DDPM
models the forward and reverse processes explicitly based on a probabilistic approach,
enabling efficient learning. NCSN, on the other hand, employs score matching techniques
to refine the noise removal process, resulting in the generation of higher-quality samples.
A diffusion model operates through two primary processes: the forward process and the
reverse process. In the forward process, noise is gradually added to the data until it trans-
forms into complete noise. Conversely, the reverse process reconstructs meaningful data
from random noise. By training a denoising network, the model generates data by injecting
random values and processing them through the reverse process.
Diffusion models have a significant advantage in modeling uncertainty through the for-
ward and reverse processes. By providing multiple possible prediction outcomes instead of
a single prediction, it can reflect the uncertainty of the real world, making it highly benefi-
cial for TSF. Therefore, it can offer prediction confidence intervals or enable probabilistic
forecasting, thereby contributing to decision-making.
For forecasting tasks, it is crucial to employ conditional generation, where conditions are
incorporated into the model to produce data that aligns with the given conditions. In this
context, historical data is used as a condition and injected into the model to enable it to learn
and predict future values. Figure 12 illustrates the diffusion model process, visualizing the
transition from data to noise and back to data. Here, the addition of conditions explains the
concept of the conditional diffusion model.
Diffusion-based models for time series forecasting have achieved significant performance
improvements through the introduction of effective conditional embedding, the integration
of time series feature extraction, and advancements in the diffusion models themselves. The
following sections explain the key characteristics of diffusion-based models according to
these classification criteria, and Table 9 provides a clear summary of this information.

4.4.1 Effective conditional embedding
Early diffusion-based models for time series forecasting focused on effective conditional
embedding to guide the reverse process (Li et al 2024b). Typically, for forecasting tasks,
conditional diffusion models use past data as a condition to predict the future. Therefore, the
meticulous construction of the condition is paramount for the denoising model to effectively
learn the data and enhance prediction performance. This highlights the importance of data
preparation in the forecasting process. This preparation allows the model to effectively uti-
lize past information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of future time-series predictions and
improving the model’s ability to learn from historical data.
TimeGrad (Rasul et al 2021) is the first notable diffusion model that operates using an
autoregressive Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) (Ho et al 2020) approach.
It encodes past data with an RNN, using the hidden state in a conditional diffusion model
for forecasting. The hidden state encapsulates information from past sequential data, captur-
ing temporal dependencies effectively. The denoising network employs dilated ConvNets
with residual connections, adopted from WaveNet (Van Den Oord et al 2016) and Dif-
fWave (Kong et al 2021), which are designed for audio generation. Unlike the commonly
used U-net for image synthesis in diffusion models, TimeGrad utilizes a broader recep-
tive field suitable for time series data, similar to audio. CSDI (Tashiro et al 2021) cap-
tures temporal and feature dependencies of time series using a two-dimensional attention
mechanism. Designed for both forecasting and imputation tasks, CSDI replaces RNNs with
Transformers for imputation since RNNs are not suitable. The attention mechanism learns
the relationships across all positions in the input sequence, capturing long-term dependen-
cies effectively. Therefore, for long-term time series forecasting, using attention is more
advantageous than RNNs and dilated convolution, as seen in TimeGrad. SSSD (Alcaraz and
Strodthoff 2023) demonstrates that replacing the Transformer used as the denoising network
in CSDI with the S4 model (Gu et al 2022) yields superior performance. This is because
S4 is more efficient and better at capturing long-term dependencies compared to the high
computational complexity required for Transformer attention. TimeDiff (Shen and Kwok
2023) enhances prediction accuracy by using future mixups during training, mixing past
data with actual future values to generate conditional signals. Including some actual future
values helps the model create effective conditional signals for more accurate predictions.
Additionally, it addresses the boundary disharmony issue in non-autoregressive models like
CSDI and SSSD. TimeDiff uses a simple statistical model, the Linear Autoregressive model,
to provide an initial guess, alleviating the boundary disharmony problem. TMDM (Li et al
2024b) offers an extreme form of effective conditional embedding. It states that the best
condition is the prediction itself, using prediction values from transformer-based models
like Informer (Zhou et al 2021) or Autoformer (Wu et al 2021), which have shown good
performance in time series forecasting tasks, as the condition. This allows the Transformer
to handle the estimated mean while the diffusion model focuses on uncertainty estimation.
Unlike previous researches that utilize conditional embeddings only in the reverse process,
TMDM uses conditional information as prior knowledge for both the forward and reverse
processes.

4.4.2 Time series feature extraction
Time series data hides various features, and there are techniques to extract these unique
characteristics effectively. Thus, many works have emerged that combine time series feature
extraction methods with diffusion models to understand the complex patterns in time series
data and improve prediction performance.
Decomposition
Decomposition techniques involve breaking down time series data into components such
as trend, seasonality, and irregularity, analyzing the unique patterns of each component. Dif-
fusion-TS (Yuan and Qiao 2024) points out that conventional methods cannot properly learn
each component because the forward process causes the components to collapse. There-
fore, it models the decomposed time series data individually during the diffusion process,
learning each component, such as trend, seasonality, and residuals, independently and then
recombining them to restore the entire time series data.
Frequency domain
Fourier analysis, a type of decomposition technique, converts time series data into the
frequency domain to analyze periodic components. This method helps identify periodic
patterns and remove noise. Crabbé et al (2024) explore the idea that the representation of
time series data in the frequency domain can provide useful inductive biases for score-based
diffusion models. This paper demonstrates that the components of time series data are more
clearly represented in the frequency domain, and diffusion models in the frequency domain
outperform those in the time domain.
Multi-scale
Multi-scale techniques analyze time series data at various time scales, effectively extract-
ing long-term trends and diverse features. This approach plays a crucial role in understand-
ing the complex patterns of time series data to improve prediction performance. MG-TSD
(Fan et al 2024b) observes that the forward process of diffusion models aligns with gradu-
ally smoothing fine data into coarser representations. It suggests that coarse-granularity data
can serve as effective guides in the intermediate stages of diffusion models. In other words,
the initial stages of the reverse process involve coarse-granularity data, guiding the process
to intermediate-stage targets. This multi-granularity level approach helps learn various lev-
els of information, enhancing prediction stability and accuracy. mr-Diff (Shen et al 2024)
constructs time series data at multiple resolutions, performing sequential predictions at each
resolution. In the initial stages, it predicts coarse data, and in subsequent stages, it uses these
predictions as conditions to generate finer data gradually. This structure incrementally adds
finer patterns and noise at each stage, ultimately reconstructing high-resolution time series
data. This allows for effective prediction of both long-term trends and short-term fluctua-
tions in time series data.
4.4.3 Additional approaches
Beyond the two main approaches mentioned earlier, there are numerous examples where
techniques evolving from the diffusion framework itself are applied to models for time
series forecasting.
Score-based generative modeling through SDEs
1 3

216 Page 54 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
(Song et al 2021) serves as continuous energy-based generative models, handling data in
a continuous time domain, thus reflecting natural and precise changes and noise in the real
world. The previously discussed methods are based on DDPM (Ho et al 2020), which add
and remove noise incrementally using fixed-time steps. However, the DDPM approach
faces challenges such as specific functional constraints and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
Some research applying SDEs overcomes these limitations and explores diverse approaches.
ScoreGrad (Yan et al 2021) is the first work to apply SDE, overcoming the constraints of
DDPM-based models and offering a more flexible and powerful generative model. D3M
(Yan et al 2024) addresses the limitations of conventional SDEs, such as the complexity of
determining drift and diffusion coefficients and slow generation speed, by utilizing a decom-
posable noise-removal diffusion model based on explicit solutions. This method reduces
computational complexity through clear SDE formulations and separates the signal decay
and noise injection processes in model design. As a result, it enhances model efficiency and
accuracy while accelerating generation speed. Crabbé et al (2024) improve denoising score
matching in the frequency domain by using mirrored Brownian motions instead of standard
Brownian motion, emphasizing the symmetry between components when applying SDEs.
Latent diffusion model
Latent Diffusion Model (Rombach et al 2022) is a generative model that operates not on
the original data directly but within a latent space where the diffusion process takes place.
Transforming data into the latent space reduces complexity and stabilizes the training pro-
cess, resulting in high-quality outputs. LDT (Feng et al 2024b) applies the concept of the
latent diffusion model to time series data, addressing the non-stationarity issues that often
arise during the compression into the latent space. Dynamically updating statistical proper-
ties during the autoencoder training process effectively overcomes these challenges and
enhances model performance.
Guidance
Some works use guidance instead of explicitly feeding conditions into the denoising
network for forecasting. Diffusion-TS (Yuan and Qiao 2024) employs classifier guidance,
using a separate classifier to guide the sampling process through the gradients of the clas-
sifier. This method maintains the basic unconditional diffusion model while performing
conditional generation tasks through various classifiers. It generates samples that are bet-
ter aligned with specific conditions, resulting in higher-quality outputs. However, classifier
guidance requires a classifier for each time step, which necessitates training a new classifier
instead of using pre-trained ones. LDT (Feng et al 2024b) uses classifier-free guidance,
learning both conditional and unconditional models within a single model to perform con-
ditional sampling. This work eliminates the need for an additional classifier and implicitly
obtains a classifier, making implementation simpler and more efficient. TSDiff (Kollovieh
et al 2024) proposes observation self-guidance, allowing the use of an unconditional dif-
fusion model for conditional generation without separate networks or modifications to the
training process.

4.5 Debut of the Mamba
4.5.1 History of the state space models (SSMs)
One of the notable recent developments is the emergence of a new architecture called Mamba
(Gu and Dao 2024). In an atmosphere previously influenced by Transformers, Mamba has
garnered significant interest from researchers and is rapidly establishing its own ecosystem.
RNNs, which were once the mainstream in sequence modeling, lost their dominance
after the advent of Transformers. This was due to the limitations in information encapsula-
tion of a “context” (single vector) in RNN-based encoder–decoder models and the slow
training speed inherent in their recurrent nature. In contrast, the parallelism of the attention
mechanism and its ability to focus on all individual pieces of information overcame the limi-
tations of RNNs and demonstrated superior performance. However, new challenges have
emerged with Transformers, such as the quadratic computational complexity, which limits
the window length, and the increased memory requirements for processing long sequences.
Subsequently, many efforts have been made to overcome the limitations of both approaches
while preserving their advantages. In this context, some research that continues the philoso-
phy of RNNs has turned its attention to state space models (SSMs) (Kalman 1960).
SSM is a mathematical framework used to model the dynamic state of a system that
changes over time, compressing only the essential information for effective sequential mod-
eling. SSM describes the relationship between the internal state of the system and external
observations and is used in various fields such as control theory, signal processing, and time
series analysis. It comprises a ‘State equation’ that explains how the internal state changes
over time and an ‘Observation equation’ that explains how the internal state is transformed
into external observations. Although it is a continuous model that performs linear transfor-
mations on the current hidden state and input, it can handle discrete sequences like time
series through discretization (Fig. 13). It closely resembles RNNs in that it combines obser-
vation data and hidden state data.
However, SSMs have different characteristics from RNNs in that they are linear and
time-invariant (LTI). This means that the operations performed on each token do not vary,
allowing for the pre-computation of global kernels. In other words, the parameter matrices
of the system do not change over time and operate consistently across time. Therefore, the
Fig. 13 Diagram of discretized state space model
1 3

216 Page 56 of 95 J. Kim et al.
ability to precompute globally applicable kernels enables parallel processing, which can
overcome the limitations of RNNs.
Early applications of SSMs, such as the S4 (Gu et al 2021) model, utilized diagonal-
ization of the transition matrix to effectively model long-term dependencies in long and
complex sequence data. These models were able to achieve high performance when com-
bined with deep learning architectures like Transformers, RNNs, and CNNs. Subsequently,
based on S4, advanced blocks like H3 (Fu et al 2023) were developed, which hierarchically
structured convolution, gating, and MLP to provide more efficient and powerful sequence
modeling (Fig. 14).
4.5.2 Introduction of the Mamba
SSMs have fixed state transition and observation equations, which limits their ability to flex-
ibly handle input data. Furthermore, due to their inherent continuous system origins, they
are weaker in information-dense and discrete domains such as text.
Mamba addresses these limitations of SSMs by introducing an advanced deep struc-
tured SSM model with selective SSM. It is designed so that the parameters of the SSM
dynamically change depending on the input, allowing for selective memory or disregard of
specific parts of the sequence, enabling efficient data processing. However, this approach,
while enhancing the system’s flexibility to better learn complex patterns, sacrifices the par-
allel processing advantages of SSMs. To compensate, traditional techniques such as kernel
fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation are applied to efficiently implement selective SSMs
on GPUs. Mamba adopts a simplified architecture centered around selective SSM, replacing
the first multiplicative gate in the traditional H3 block with an activation function and incor-
porating an SSM into the gated MLP block. Due to the absence of attention mechanisms or
separate MLP blocks, computational complexity is reduced, resulting in efficient training,
fast inference, and high scalability and versatility.

4.5.3 Applications of the Mamba
In the field of time-series forecasting, there is a growing trend to apply Mamba. A lot of
variants based on Mamba have been proposed to address TSF tasks, and these models are
reported to exceed the performance of Transformer SOTA models.
Most of these models typically share the following common features:
● They aim to ensure stability in large networks. Mamba, based on SSM, heavily relies
on the eigenvalues of the system’s dynamic matrix. Since the general solution of the
system is expressed as an exponential function of the eigenvalues, if the real part of the
eigenvalues is positive, the system cannot converge and becomes unstable. Therefore, a
key feature is the ideation aimed at improving this instability.
● They explicitly incorporate the learning of channel correlations. Recent research has
demonstrated the superiority of channel dependence (CD) learning strategies, and the
adoption of the CD strategy by the iTransformer, which shows SOTA performance, has
further heightened this trend. This is a common feature observed in other foundational
models as well.
● They incorporate various techniques from transformer-based models. Mamba-based
models, which integrate various techniques from Transformers such as patching, fre-
quency domain application, bidirectional processing, and FFN incorporation, are dem-
onstrating significant performance improvements. The diverse techniques developed
over many years of research on Transformer models provide valuable ideation for
Mamba variants.
The following are representative examples of Mamba-based models for handling TSF tasks
and their key technical features (Table 10).
Embedding and multi-scale learning
In this section, we introduce methodologies for embedding and learning from data at
various scales. These approaches primarily focus on richly extracting information to capture
long-term dependencies and context.
TimeMachine (Ahamed and Cheng 2024) aims to capture long-term dependencies and
context at different scales through two-stage embeddings. It is divided into internal and
external embeddings based on embedding dimensions, and each section consists of two
parallel Mamba modules that explore temporal dependencies and channel dependencies,
respectively. The internal Mamba module operates at a low resolution to capture both global
and local contexts, while the external Mamba module operates at a high resolution to cap-
ture the global context.
Channel correlation learning
Next, we examine models that focus explicitly on learning the inter-channel correlations
in time series data. These models are centered around techniques that effectively integrate
information from each channel and model their interdependencies.
S-Mamba (Wang et al 2024d) features bi-directional Mamba blocks to consider both
past and future information, enabling the learning of inter-channel correlations. The role of
learning temporal dependencies is assigned to the Feed Forward Network (FFN). By clearly
separating the roles of Mamba blocks and FFN, computational efficiency is improved,
ensuring the stability of the Mamba architecture in large networks. In SiMBA (Patro and

space model
Agneeswaran 2024b), channel modeling is achieved through Einstein FFT (EinFFT), while
sequence modeling is handled by Mamba modules. After applying the Fast Fourier Trans-
form (FFT), the real and imaginary parts are separated, and their respective weights are
learned. Channel mixing is performed through Einstein Matrix Multiplication (EMM), cre-
ating new data that reflects the relational information between channels, thus internaliz-
ing channel relationships. Additionally, to ensure system stability, eigenvalues of the state
matrix are adjusted to be negative through Fourier transformation and nonlinear layers.
MambaTS (Cai et al 2024c) reconstructs sequences by integrating past information of all
variables to learn channel correlations. Since variable information is integrated in advance,
unnecessary convolution in Mamba blocks is removed to enhance computational efficiency,
and dropout is applied to Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to reduce overfitting. Addition-
ally, Variable Permutation Training (VPT) is introduced to dynamically determine the opti-
mal order of integrated variable information, enabling predictions based on the optimal
sequence of variables. C-Mamba (Zeng et al 2024) generates new virtual sample data by
linearly combining different channels (channel mixup), which is expected to enhance gen-

eralization performance. It uses a main block that combines patched Mamba modules with
attention modules for learning channel relationships.
Sequence information and dependency learning
This category emphasizes methods for learning the sequential information and depen-
dencies in time series data. It proposes various techniques for modeling both long-term and
short-term dependencies within the series.
Mambaformer (Xu et al 2024a) is a hybrid model that combines Mamba with a Trans-
former decoder framework. Since the Mamba block naturally internalizes the sequence order
information, positional embedding is unnecessary. Long-term dependencies are learned
through the Mamba block, while short-term dependencies are captured through the self-
attention layer, effectively capturing the overall dependencies. This approach overcomes
the computational efficiency limitations of attention mechanisms. Bi-Mamba+ (Liang et al
2024a) integrates patching techniques to finely learn inter-dependencies in the data. To pre-
serve long-term information, it introduces Mamba+ blocks, which add a forget gate to the
Mamba block. It also employs a Bi-Mamba+ encoder to process input sequences bidirection-
ally. Using the Spearman correlation coefficient, the Series-Relation-Aware (SRA) decider
is designed to automatically select channel tokenization strategies (CI or CD). DTMamba
(Wu et al 2024b) is composed of Dual Twin Mamba blocks, effectively learning long-term
dependencies in time series data channel independently. Each Twin Mamba block consists
of two parallel Mamba structures that process the same input data to capture different pat-
terns effectively. One Mamba structure learns detailed patterns and short-term variations,
while the other learns overall patterns and long-term trends.
Theoretical frameworks and efficient modeling
Lastly, we explore models that introduce new theoretical frameworks or propose efficient
modeling techniques. These models focus on effectively capturing the dynamic characteris-
tics of time series data and employ theoretical approaches and methodologies that enhance
computational efficiency.
Time-SSM (Hu et al 2024a) proposes a theoretical framework called the Dynamic Spec-
tral Operator, which extends the Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projection (GOBP) theory
for efficient use of SSM. The Dynamic Spectral Operator explores the changing spectral
space over time to effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of time series data. To
implement this, a novel variant of the SSM basis called Hippo-LegP is proposed, enabling
more precise modeling of time series data and achieving optimal performance through
S4D-real initialization. This allows it to demonstrate excellent performance with only about
one-seventh of the parameters required by Mamba models. Chimera (Behrouz et al 2024)
features the use of 2D SSM to capture dependencies independently along the time and vari-
able axes. By updating states in parallel along both axes, it achieves efficient computation.
The emergence of a new deep learning architecture, Mamba, is causing a shift in the long-
standing hegemony of deep learning architectures. In current TSF tasks, which increasingly
deal with long-term sequences, Mamba’s strengths-efficient sequence processing, selective
information retention, simplified architecture, and hardware optimization-prove to be highly
valuable. These features allow Mamba-based models to overcome the limitations of Trans-
formers, showing rapid performance improvements in a short period and suggesting a new
direction for deep learning modeling. The growth trajectory of Mamba raises attention to
whether it will become the new dominance in this field.

5 TSF latest open challenges and handling methods
5.1 Channel dependency comprehension
Spread of channel independent strategy
Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting primarily hinges on how well it can learn the
short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. However, many recent real-world data-
sets predominantly deal with multivariate data, where the relationships between variables
carry significant semantic information. As the relationships between variables become more
complex, models can provide more information and thus improve predictive performance
by leveraging this complexity.
Traditionally, it has been vaguely assumed that understanding the relationships between
variables in time series forecasting problems would make better performance. Despite being
obtained from different instruments, the data observe the same phenomenon, which intui-
tively suggests that they offer rich interpretations from various perspectives. However, with
the PatchTST (Nie et al 2023) model adopting a channel-independent (CI) strategy and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, research has begun to question the previ-
ously assumed channel-dependent (CD) strategy. These studies have shown that high per-
formance can be attained without learning the interactions between variables.
The CI strategy simplifies the model by excluding inter-variable modeling, allowing it to
focus solely on learning the temporal dependencies of each channel. This approach reduces
model complexity and enables faster inference, while also mitigating the risk of overfitting
due to noise from inter-variable interactions. Additionally, since the addition of new chan-
nels does not affect the model, it can adapt flexibly to changes in data. These advantages
have led many studies to adopt the CI strategy, resulting in improved performance. How-
ever, the CI strategy did not consistently show superior performance across all studies. The
CD strategy still demonstrated high performance in many studies, such as iTransformer (Liu
et al 2024c). Additionally, both strategies showed inconsistent performance depending on
the datasets used. Consequently, without clear justification, both CI and CD strategies were
employed according to the researchers’ preferences for a period of time.
Importance of learning channel correlations
Learning the correlations between variables remains important. In multivariate time
series data, each variable does not change independently but is interdependently related
to others. Even if these relationships sometimes introduce noise or fail to provide critical
information, the relationships themselves are not devoid of meaning. The information from
multivariate variables often intertwines to create complex patterns that cannot be captured
by a single variable. Understanding the correlations between multiple variables helps inter-
pret these complex patterns.
Modeling the correlations between variables is also crucial for improving prediction
accuracy. Especially when dealing with long sequence patterns, it is essential to understand
the numerous local patterns within them. During this process, important causal relationships
are often derived from other variables or exogenous factors. In the case of noisy data, learn-
ing the correlations between variables can help extract key information effectively. By com-
prehensively observing the information from multiple variables, it is possible to emphasize
important features and complement missing information.
What makes CI look better?
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 61 of 95 216
If the CD strategy is important and has the potential for significant performance improve-
ments, why do many studies show that the CI strategy performs better? To answer this ques-
tion, some research has been conducted, and the following summary can be provided based
on the “The capacity and robustness trade-off: Revisiting the channel independent strategy
for multivariate time series forecasting” (Lu Han 2024) paper.
According to the study, an examination of the Auto-correlation Function (ACF) values
between the training set and test set of the benchmark data, which have been used in various
experiments, revealed a distribution shift. The ACF can identify the correlation between
data values at specific time lags in time series data.
A distribution shift refers to the difference in statistical properties between the training
data and test data extracted from the same dataset. Distribution shifts can occur for various
reasons, often due to anomalies in the training series or variations in the trend, but some-
times the exact cause cannot be clearly defined. An important finding from the study is that
the CI strategy demonstrates relatively greater robustness to distribution shifts. Since the CI
strategy relies on the average ACF of all channels, it is less sensitive to distribution shifts
compared to the CD strategy, which depends on the ACF variations of individual channels.
Additionally, by excluding inter-variable relationships, the CI strategy simplifies the model,
reducing the likelihood of overfitting and enhancing robustness. Therefore, the CI strategy
has been able to demonstrate good performance on benchmark datasets where distribution
shifts are present.
However, this does not imply that the CI strategy is superior to the CD strategy. It merely
suggests that, in some datasets, the positive effects resulting from the robustness of the CI
strategy outweigh the advantages of learning inter-variable relationships. Conversely, if dis-
tribution shifts can be effectively alleviated, the CD strategy can provide much more useful
information than the CI strategy. To this end, even the application of simple regularization
methods, such as Predict Residual with Regularization (PRReg), adapting low-rank layers,
and using the MAE loss function, can reverse the performance gap. Furthermore, various
distribution shift alleviation methodologies have been researched, and these can be applied
in a model-agnostic manner. The details of these methodologies will be discussed in the next
section, and the previous content has been illustrated in Fig. 15
Recent approaches
As the effectiveness of learning channel correlation has been validated, recent multivari-
ate time series forecasting problems have predominantly adopted the CD strategy. In con-
trast, the CI strategy is increasingly applied in a limited way, primarily in univariate models
focused on temporal dependency.
Approaches to addressing recent MTS problems can be broadly categorized into three
types. The first approach involves explicitly integrating modules for channel mixing into
the backbone model. Most models adopt this strategy, aiming to maximize effectiveness
by explicitly incorporating channel correlation. However, as discussed earlier, distribution
shifts in the dataset can potentially degrade the performance of the CD strategy, necessitat-
ing the introduction of appropriate alleviation methods. By employing this combination, the
strengths of learning channel correlations can be applied more reliably, leading to enhanced
model performance. The distribution shift alleviation methods will be discussed in detail in
Sect. 5.2.
The second approach implicitly incorporates channel correlations into the input. Instead
of explicitly integrating channel learning modules into the backbone model, this method
1 3

216 Page 62 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Fig. 15 Comparison of CI and CD strategies in channel correlations
takes a preprocessing approach by mixing channel information in advance to create a new
input, which is then fed into the prediction model. This new input combines the mixed
channel information with the original individual channel data before being processed by the
prediction model. By inherently reflecting the relationships between channels, this method
allows even a simple CI backbone to achieve the effectiveness of a more complex CD
model. Models like SOFTS (Han et al 2024) and C-LoRA (Nie et al 2024) fall into this
category.
The third approach adaptively selects between the CI and CD strategies. The model is
designed to operate in both directions, allowing it to choose the most effective strategy based
on the characteristics of the dataset being used. In some cases, like TSMixer (Ekambaram
et al 2023), the user can manually select the appropriate strategy, while in others, such as Bi-
Mamba+ (Liang et al 2024a), the model automatically determines the optimal strategy. The
second and third approaches both utilize the CI strategy alongside the CD strategy, aiming
to integrate the advantages of both into the model. A summary of the criteria for selecting
these strategies is presented in Fig. 16
In the past, the criteria for selecting channel strategies were ambiguous, but recent
research has provided clear guidelines. Based on these advancements, users can now choose
the appropriate channel strategy according to the characteristics of their dataset, effectively
improving model performance through various approaches.
5.2 Alleviation of distribution shift
Many real-world time series data exhibit non-stationarity, where their distribution gradu-
ally changes. For instance, trends such as increasing electricity consumption and shifts in
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 63 of 95 216
Fig. 16 Recent approaches to channel strategies
consumer preferences can lead to changes in data distribution. This non-stationarity intro-
duces challenges for the generalization of time series forecasting (TSF) models by creating
distribution discrepancies within the training data and between the training and test data. To
mitigate the issue of distribution shift caused by non-stationarity in time series forecasting,
various research efforts have been proposed.
Representative approaches for addressing distribution shifts include Domain Adapta-
tion, Transfer Learning, and Robustness Techniques. Domain Adaptation aims to reduce the
distribution differences between the source and target domains to improve generalization
performance across domains. This approach is divided into supervised domain adaptation,
which uses some labeled data from the target domain, and unsupervised domain adaptation
which aligns feature distributions using unlabeled datasets. Unsupervised domain adap-
tation began with the introduction of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Wang et al
2023a) -based methods and advanced with the emergence of Generative Adversarial Net-
works (GANs) (Sankaranarayanan et al 2018), which led to the development of adversarial
domain adaptation techniques. Transfer Learning (Pan and Yang 2009) refers to applying a
model trained in one domain or task to a new dataset. This includes Feature Transfer, which
reuses or retrains specific layers of a pre-trained network for a new task, and Fine-Tuning
which adjusts the entire pre-trained model to fit the new dataset. Transfer learning originated
from pre-trained embeddings in NLP in the late 1990s, expanded through CNNs, and even-
tually evolved with LLMs. Robustness Techniques enhance a model’s ability to maintain
performance despite data uncertainties, such as noise, outliers, and data scarcity. Methods
such as Dropout (Srivastava et al 2014) and Data Augmentation (Wong et al 2016) help
models handle noise, while robust loss functions like the Huber loss (Huber 1992) reduce
sensitivity to outliers. These techniques have been widely adopted in time series forecasting
models since 2020.
This survey focuses on one prominent approach that introduces normalization and denor-
malization modules within a normalization-TSF model-denormalization framework. This
1 3

216 Page 64 of 95 J. Kim et al.
framework has evolved as a specialized approach for mitigating non-stationarity within the
same domain of time series data. Here, normalization is applied to the look-back window
before feeding it into the TSF model, aiming to remove input statistics. As a result, the
TSF model processes inputs from a less time-variant distribution. Denormalization is then
applied to the forecasting window obtained from the TSF model to restore the original
statistics. The denormalized forecasting window is ultimately used as the final forecast.
However, calculating the appropriate statistics for normalization and denormalization in
non-stationary scenarios is a non-trivial task, and numerous studies have been proposed
within this framework to address this challenge (Table 11).
DAIN (Passalis et al 2019) introduces a Deep Adaptive Input Normalization layer that
learns how much to shift and scale each observation end-to-end. Considering the chang-
ing distribution characteristics of time series data, this approach outperforms widely used
normalization methods like batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) and instance nor-
malization (Ulyanov et al 2016) across various domains, highlighting the importance of
normalization techniques in TSF. However, DAIN omits a denormalization step, meaning
it does not account for restoring statistics in the forecasting results. In contrast, RevIN (Kim
et al 2021), which extends instance normalization to be reversible, adopts a normalization-
denormalization framework. RevIN performs instance normalization on each look-back
window, followed by variable-wise multiplication of a learnable scale factor and addition of
a bias factor. During de-normalization, the same parameters are applied in reverse. NST (Liu
et al 2022) normalizes the look-back window in a non-parametric manner without a learn-
able affine transformation and then de-normalizes the prediction window using the mean
and standard deviation of the look-back window. Dish-TS (Fan et al 2023) learns a mod-
ule that predicts the statistics of the prediction window, considering the distribution shift
between the look-back window and subsequent prediction windows, and performs normal-
ization and de-normalization accordingly. SAN (Liu et al 2024e) considers the distribution

shift within both the look-back window and prediction windows, performing statistical pre-
diction on smaller slices.
5.3 Enhancing causality
Why causal analysis is essential for accurate time series forecasting
Causal analysis is crucial in achieving accurate time series forecasting by better under-
standing the underlying factors driving data patterns. Time series data often exhibit correla-
tions that can be misleading without a proper understanding of causality. For instance, two
variables may show a strong correlation simply due to coincidence or because they are both
influenced by a third, unobserved variable. Without distinguishing between correlation and
causation, forecasting models risk attributing changes in the data to irrelevant or spurious
factors, leading to inaccurate predictions. Causal analysis helps overcome this by identify-
ing the true cause-and-effect relationships, ensuring the model is grounded in reality rather
than coincidental patterns.
Moreover, causal analysis enhances the interpretability and practical application of fore-
casting models. By explaining how different variables influence the outcome, causal models
uncover the underlying mechanisms driving the forecast, which is crucial for decision-mak-
ing. Businesses and policymakers can use these insights to predict the impact of specific
actions, such as policy changes or marketing strategies, and make informed decisions based
on the likely effects. This ability to simulate interventions and conduct counterfactual sce-
narios makes causal analysis an indispensable tool for accurate and actionable time series
forecasting.
Research on TSF with causality
As mentioned earlier, utilizing causality in time series forecasting not only improves
prediction accuracy but also enhances model interpretability. For these reasons, research
applying causal discovery information to time series forecasting models is actively ongo-
ing. In particular, various methodologies have been proposed in fields such as healthcare,
environmental science, and social sciences, where causal discovery is actively researched.
In TSF, various causal inference methods are employed to identify cause-and-effect rela-
tionships within the data. The Granger Causality Test (Granger 1969) examines whether
the historical information of one variable helps predict the future of another variable. This
method detects the direction of causal influence based on regression analysis. However, it
has limitations in fully excluding indirect correlations caused by the presence of a third vari-
able. Structural Causal Models (SCM) (Pearl et al 2000) utilize causal graphs and structural
equations to model the relationships between variables. These models enable intervention
simulations and counterfactual analyses, providing a visual representation of causal relation-
ships to aid interpretation and integrate interactions across multiple variables. Do-Calculus
(Pearl 1995) is an intervention analysis technique for quantitatively analyzing the effects
of interventions by computing the impact that changes in specific variables have on others,
thereby supporting causal predictions. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (Rosenbaum and
Rubin 1983) is a method for performing causal inference by matching groups with similar
characteristics. This approach minimizes the influence of confounders and more accurately
evaluates the effects of interventions. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (Pearl 1998) are
directional, non-cyclic graphs that visually represent the relationships between causes and
effects. DAGs help clearly identify causal structures and understand complex interactions
1 3

216 Page 66 of 95 J. Kim et al.
among variables. Various attempts are being made to enhance the causality of TSF by utiliz-
ing these diverse causal inference methods (Runge et al 2019; Schölkopf et al 2021).
Qian et al (2023) introduce a model to predict Kuroshio Volume Transport (KVT).
It employs multivariate causal analysis to discover causal relationships and selects only
the variables with causal relationships to make predictions using an LSTM model. This
approach captures meaningful information from causally related variables and prevents the
model from being confused by unrelated variables. Mu et al (2023) propose a model for
predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation. It uses information obtained through causal dis-
covery not only for variable selection but also by directly applying it to a GCN (Graph Con-
volutional Network). The overall structure utilizes a symmetrical encoder and decoder of
ConvLSTM, with the GCN acting as a coupler in between. Sharma et al (2022) focuses on a
model for energy consumption. It applies the Granger causality test to determine the causal
relationship between weather conditions and energy consumption and then integrates this
causal information into a Bi-LSTM to improve energy consumption prediction accuracy.
CausalGNN (Wang et al 2022b) is a model aimed at epidemic forecasting. It extracts causal
features using the SIRD model and incorporates them into an Attention-Based Dynamic
GNN module to learn spatio-temporal patterns. Caformer (Zhang et al 2024b) criticizes
existing methods for failing to learn causal relationships effectively due to false correlations
caused by environmental factors. To address this, it explicitly models environmental influ-
ences and removes them to obtain reliable causal relationships.
5.4 Time series feature extraction
Time Series Feature Extraction is the process of extracting useful information from time
series data to enhance model performance. In other words, it involves identifying and quan-
tifying time series data into key patterns, trends, seasonality, outliers, periodicity, and sta-
tistical characteristics to transform it into a form that is suitable for model training. This
process clarifies the unique patterns or characteristics of time series data, allowing models to
learn them more effectively. This enhances the understanding of data, improves the predic-
tive performance of models, and increases efficiency through data compression. The reasons
why Time Series Feature Extraction is necessary are as follows:
● Understanding the characteristics of data Time series data, which is ordered sequen-
tially over time, possesses unique characteristics such as various patterns, seasonality,
and periodicity. However, these data are complex and high-dimensional, making these
features not easily apparent. The continuous values in time series data tend to be similar
to adjacent values, which makes it challenging to accurately distinguish the context and
meaning of each data point, often resulting in a lack of semantic information. Therefore,
the process of transforming time series data into an analyzable format and extracting
key features is crucial for understanding the inherent behaviors and interactions within
the data.
● Explainability of data Unlike traditional machine learning methods, deep learning mod-
els automatically learn useful features from data without requiring manual feature ex-
traction. However, due to the nonlinear structure of deep learning models, it is often
difficult for humans to interpret the learned features. The extracted features can better
explain the structural characteristics of the data, helping to interpret and understand its
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 67 of 95 216
meaning. This process provides critical insights for making data-driven decisions and
contributes to improving explainability in complex model architectures.
● Enhancing Model Performance By summarizing complex time series data and remov-
ing noise, it emphasizes the essential signals of the data, reducing the computational
burden on models and improving predictive performance. Focusing on critical infor-
mation allows the model to avoid overfitting to the training data and develop strong
generalization capabilities.
Decomposing or transforming time series data into different forms before feeding it into the
model is a widely used and researched approach for feature extraction. These approaches
help the model focus on learning the critical information in the data, thereby reducing sen-
sitivity to noise and overfitting. These methods are not limited to specific architectures
and can be applied across various models. Figure 17 presents the key techniques for time
series feature extraction, followed by an explanation of related application models for these
approaches.

5.4.1 Decomposition
Time series decomposition has long been used as a fundamental time series feature extrac-
tion technique, which involves separating time series data into components such as trend,
seasonality, periodicity, and residual. The advantage of decomposition is that it simplifies
complex time series data by breaking it down into understandable, independent compo-
nents, enabling more accurate model predictions and easier analysis and interpretation.
Moving average kernel
Many models apply a Moving Average kernel to the input sequence to separate trend and
seasonality components. In this process, high-frequency noise or short-term fluctuations
are removed, allowing long-term trends to be more clearly captured and overall patterns of
increase and decrease to be emphasized. The method of using a Moving Average Kernel is
widely adopted due to its computational simplicity and efficiency. However, it has limita-
tions when dealing with complex nonlinear patterns.
Autoformer (Wu et al 2021) goes beyond using decomposition techniques merely as pre-
processing for forecasting tasks by progressively decomposing time series data throughout
the prediction process within the model itself. Similarly, CrossWaveNet (Huang et al 2024b)
employs a dual-channel network to perform gradual deep cross-decomposition, enabling
it to capture complex temporal patterns effectively. Likewise, models such as FEDformer
(Zhou et al 2022), LTSF-Linear (Zeng et al 2023), and PDMLP (Tang and Zhang 2024)
utilize a moving average kernel to individually model each component of the time series
data, which are then recombined to make effective predictions. However, the Moving Aver-
age method lacks robustness because it is not learnable by the model. Additionally, since it
assigns equal weights to each data point within the sliding window, it has limited ability to
identify specific patterns. To address these limitations, Leddam (Yu et al 2024) use learn-
able 1D convolutional kernels, which can better capture nonlinear structures and dynamic
variations. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models face challenges as components like trend
and seasonality can easily collapse during the diffusion process. Diffusion-TS (Yuan and
Qiao 2024) overcomes this by applying the diffusion process after decomposition, thereby
preserving the characteristics of each component more effectively. Through this approach,
the traditional limitations of time series decomposition are overcome, allowing for a more
effective separation of trend and seasonal components.
Downsampling
The technique of using downsampling for decomposition is also frequently employed.
Originating from signal processing, downsampling involves reducing the number of sam-
ples from the original signal, effectively decreasing the data by a specific ratio. Time series
forecasting is typically achieved through pooling methods, where representative values
are extracted from specific segments of the time series data, thereby suppressing high-fre-
quency components and emphasizing low-frequency components. By adjusting the pooling
size, various downsampling levels can be achieved, allowing for the exploration of multiple
patterns within the data.
SparseTSF (Lin et al 2024b) and SutraNets (Bergsma et al 2023) use downsampling to
separate data into trend and periodic components, predicting each subseries independently.
This allows the model to learn each component separately and better understand the influ-
ence of each on the complex time series data, enhancing prediction accuracy. By dividing the
complex time series data into various sub-series, it can be decomposed into a simpler form,
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 69 of 95 216
thereby reducing the overall complexity of the model. Therefore, this approach enhances the
model’s generalization ability and helps prevent overfitting.
Non-linear methods
While Moving Average Kernel and Downsampling are linear methods, Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) (Huang et al 1998) is a non-linear and non-stationary signal analy-
sis technique that decomposes time series data into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions
(IMFs). EMD involves finding local extrema in the signal and using linear interpolation for
the upper and lower envelopes, and by subtracting their average, it extracts high-frequency
components as IMFs iteratively. The final residual signal, also known as the residue, reveals
the long-term trend. EMD is advantageous for processing non-linear and non-stationary
time series data due to its adaptive nature, effectively separating and analyzing complex pat-
terns and changes in the time series. EMD-BI-LSTM (Mounir et al 2023) proposes a method
that combines EMD with a conventional Bi-LSTM model for forecasting electric load time
series data. By applying EMD, the model effectively captures complex non-linear relation-
ships, thereby enhancing forecasting performance.
However, EMD has a mode mixing problem, where signals of different frequencies are
mixed within the same IMF (Xu et al 2019). In the signal decomposition process of EMD,
IMF is generated based on local extrema, which causes difficulties in independently sepa-
rating components for signals with sudden changes, such as intermittent signals. This leads
to a failure in frequency separation, which not only reduces prediction performance but
also impairs interpretability. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) (Wu and
Huang 2009) addresses this mode mixing problem by adding noise to the original signal and
repeating the decomposition process, averaging the results. Through this process, signals
with different scales are properly aligned into the correct IMFs. Through successive itera-
tions, the influence of the noise is reduced, and the components of the original signal are
emphasized, providing more physically meaningful results and enabling more accurate and
stable time series decomposition. Yang and Yang (2020) proposes models applying EEMD
to LSTM, linear regression, and Bayesian ridge regression for forecasting.
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) (Dragomiretskiy and Zosso 2013) is a method
that uses variational optimization to separate signals into modes with specific frequency
bands. Each mode’s frequency center and bandwidth are determined through variational
optimization. As the frequency ranges do not overlap, the separation is clearer and more
stable. However, compared to EMD, which requires relatively simple calculations, VMD is
computationally more complex due to its use of variational optimization. Peng et al (2023)
proposes a new model for crude oil price forecasting that applies VMD. By decomposing
the time series data with VMD, transforming it into images, and extracting features with
CNN, this method improves forecasting performance for oil prices. It effectively utilizes
the advantages of VMD by making predictions with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit
(BGRU).
Various decomposition methods are widely used in time series forecasting. However,
decomposition methods also have some drawbacks. When the data is divided into separate
components based on different rules, the model predicts each component independently. As
a result, important interactions or relationships may not be considered, which can lead to
underutilization of necessary information for prediction and degrade performance. Never-
theless, considering the characteristics of time series, such as periodicity, trends, and noise,
decomposition remains a powerful technique. Moreover, since time series data is more dif-
1 3

216 Page 70 of 95 J. Kim et al.
ficult to intuitively interpret compared to other data types, decomposition provides interpret-
ability, which helps increase the model’s trustworthiness.
5.4.2 Multi-scale
The multi-scale approach analyzes data at various time scales, capturing patterns and trends
at multiple levels simultaneously. This method is beneficial not only for time series data but
also in fields like computer vision and natural language processing (Fan et al 2021; Nawrot
et al 2021). By integrating information from longer time frames, the multi-scale approach
plays a significant role in improving performance in time series forecasting.
MTST (Zhang et al 2024e), PDMLP (Tang and Zhang 2024), and FTMixer (Li et al
2024d) extend the patching application to a multi-scale framework, where shorter patches
effectively learn high-frequency patterns and longer patches capture long-term trends. Time-
Mixer (Wang et al 2024a) and AMD (Hu et al 2024b) leverage multi-scale decomposition
to capitalize on the strengths of each scale, enabling the model to make more accurate pre-
dictions. HD-TTS (Marisca et al 2024) uses spatiotemporal downsampling to decompose
data into various scales across both time and space. Scaleformer (Shabani et al 2023) and
Pathformer (Chen et al 2024b) apply the multi-scale concept to the overall model architec-
ture, while HD-TTS hierarchically implements temporal and spatial downsampling. MG-
TSD (Fan et al 2024b) and mr-Diff (Shen et al 2024) successfully integrate multi-scale by
incorporating inductive biases that prioritize generating coarse data in the early stages of the
diffusion reverse process.
5.4.3 Domain transformation
A common method for enhancing the expression of latent periodic features in time series
data is to transform the data into the frequency domain. Techniques such as Fourier trans-
formation, Wavelet transformation, and Cosine transformation are commonly used for this
purpose. Generally, time series data exhibits periodicity, which refers to patterns that repeat
at regular intervals. Frequency transformations effectively explore this periodicity. In time
series analysis, frequency transformations are used with two main approaches: extracting
periodic components and direct learning in the frequency domain.
Periodicity extraction
Periodicity in time series data serves as critical information for predictive models, where
features that may be hidden in the time domain can be more easily uncovered in the fre-
quency domain. Frequency transformations are advantageous because they can remove high-
frequency noise while retaining important low-frequency components, thereby improving
data quality. By selectively extracting key frequency components and feeding them into the
model, the process helps in learning essential patterns, enhances computational efficiency,
and reduces model complexity. Some models leverage these characteristics to identify and
extract various periodic patterns in the data. These adaptively extracted patterns are used
either as inputs for the model or integrated into the learning process, thereby enhancing the
model’s predictive performance.
Autoformer (Wu et al 2021) utilizes periodicity extracted through auto-correlation within
the Attention mechanism. TimesNet (Wu et al 2023) transforms periodic components into a
2D format to train the time series with CNNs. MSGNet (Cai et al 2024a) uses periodic com-
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 71 of 95 216
ponents to allow the model to determine appropriate scale levels for multi-scale analysis
autonomously. However, since the periodicity extracted in this manner is based on selective
sampling, it does not encompass all the latent information, and if critical information is not
selected, performance degradation becomes inevitable.
Training in the frequency domain
The approach of directly training models in the frequency domain is widely studied as
it overcomes these limitations by evenly learning all latent frequency components, ensur-
ing that critical information is not missed. While time series data can exhibit complex and
varied patterns in the time domain, these patterns can often be succinctly represented by a
few dominant frequency components when transformed into the frequency domain (Zhou
et al 2022). This simplification makes the learning process more straightforward, as most of
the information can be captured with a minimal set of frequency components. This method
allows for an easy transition to the frequency domain while preserving the original informa-
tion, thanks to various transformation and inverse transformation techniques. When time
series data exhibit nonlinear characteristics, learning in the frequency domain can better
capture these complex patterns than in the time domain. The frequency domain approach
doesn’t require consideration of time-axis variations, enabling stable performance even with
non-stationary data. Furthermore, this method allows for efficient learning by compressing
the data without losing important characteristics.
In the frequency domain, each frequency component is represented as a complex num-
ber, consisting of a real part and an imaginary part, each conveying different information.
The real part is related to the magnitude (amplitude) of the time series data, indicating how
prominent the periodic components are. The imaginary part, on the other hand, relates to
the phase information of the data, determining the temporal positioning of the frequency
components. By simultaneously understanding the amplitude and phase information in the
frequency domain, models can accurately capture and predict complex periodic patterns in
the data. The research initially focused on simply changing the domain, but more recently, it
has been moving towards expanding the expressiveness of the frequency domain.
FreTS (Yi et al 2024) and Crabbé et al (2024) transform data into the frequency domain
before feeding it into the model and then convert the predicted values back into the time
domain. Simply converting data to the frequency domain has limitations in achieving good
model performance, leading to the development of models that overcome these challenges.
Research continues to expand the representation in the frequency domain to fully utilize
its rich features. FEDformer (Zhou et al 2022) applies season-trend decomposition and
then performs attention in the frequency domain, facilitating independent modeling of key
information components. Fredformer (Piao et al 2024) not only transforms data into the fre-
quency domain but also investigates frequency bias through experiments, addressing issues
in the frequency domain using frequency normalization techniques. FITS (Xu et al 2024c)
utilizes distinct complex-valued linear layers in the frequency domain to learn amplitude
scaling and phase changes, thereby enhancing the frequency representation of input time
series through interpolation learning. DERITS (Fan et al 2024a) effectively handles the non-
stationarity of time series data by differentiating frequency components and representing
them in a static form that is easier to predict. SiMBA (Patro and Agneeswaran 2024b) trans-
forms time series data into the frequency domain using Fourier transforms, learning real
and imaginary components separately, thus allowing more precise analysis of data in the
frequency domain and improving model prediction performance. While frequency bands
1 3

216 Page 72 of 95 J. Kim et al.
capture global dependencies well, they often struggle with local dependency capture. To
overcome this, WaveForM (Yang et al 2023a) uses discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to
decompose time series data into various frequency bands while preserving the time informa-
tion of each band. This approach captures frequency changes within specific time intervals,
simultaneously capturing features from both time and frequency domains. FTMixer (Li et al
2024d) proposes a method that directly utilizes data from both domains to leverage the
strengths of global dependency extraction in the frequency domain and local dependency
extraction in the time domain.
5.4.4 Additional approach
In addition to the methods previously described, various other approaches have been
explored. A notable example is the use of High-Dimensional Embedding, which generates
high-dimensional representations to better capture the essential information of the data. This
approach extracts complex, multidimensional information from the original time series data
and integrates it to enhance the model’s predictive capabilities. For instance, CATS (Lu et al
2024) creates a new Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) by combining variables from the input
data and then utilizes these for prediction. SOFTS (Han et al 2024) focuses on extracting
common features (Core) from the variables and incorporating them into the learning pro-
cess. Furthermore, BSA (Kang et al 2024) enhances feature representation by leveraging
temporal correlations between continuously streaming input samples, rather than depend-
ing solely on a single current input. The method accumulates multiple scales of feature
transformations over time via an exponential moving average (EMA), then applies Spectral
Attention to these multi-scale momentums to capture long-range dependencies and enrich
the resulting features.
Efforts to effectively represent the complex features of time series data for better model
learning are being explored in various forms. These efforts are essential research topics
for improving performance in the challenging field of time series forecasting. Addition-
ally, integrating these feature extraction techniques appropriately within the basic struc-
ture of existing deep learning models can create synergy, enhancing the model’s predictive
accuracy.
5.4.5 Automated feature engineering and self-supervised learning
In TSF, extracting meaningful features has traditionally required domain expertise and
extensive manual work. However, such approaches are often time-consuming and costly,
and they may miss critical patterns when dealing with complex data. To address these chal-
lenges, automated feature engineering has become increasingly important for automatically
identifying key patterns in the data. One of the core techniques for automated feature engi-
neering is self-supervised learning (Zhang et al 2024a).
Self-supervised learning is a pretraining approach that enables models to automatically
learn important features from unlabeled datasets by identifying patterns directly from the
data itself. This allows the model to capture structural patterns without relying on manual
feature extraction, reducing the dependency on labeled data. Key approaches in self-super-
vised learning for TSF are as follows. Transformation-based approach learns key features
by comparing patterns before and after data transformations, such as time shifts and scaling.
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 73 of 95 216
For example, TS-TCC (Eldele et al 2021) enhances features by applying various transforma-
tions and learning the pattern similarities between the transformed data. Time Correlation
Learning extracts temporal dependencies in time series data by learning the relationships
between past and future time points. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) (Oord et al 2018)
divides the data into multiple time segments and learns the correlations between these seg-
ments. Mask-based Learning involves masking specific time points in the time series data
and predicting these masked points based on the remaining data to learn key patterns (Wang
et al 2022a). The application of such self-supervised learning approaches can enhance the
performance of TSF (Xu et al 2022; Wu et al 2023).
Self-supervised learning enables models to automatically recognize and extract key pat-
terns and nonlinear relationships from data without labeled examples. It can effectively
learn from small datasets, addressing the issue of label scarcity and contributing to model
lightweight and algorithm optimization. In particular, multimodal self-supervised learn-
ing techniques, which integrate time series data with other data types such as images and
text, are expected to advance, enabling the model to learn richer patterns. Such multimodal
learning can significantly contribute to solving complex decision-making problems, such
as healthcare diagnostics and disaster prediction. Additionally, research on converting the
learned features into interpretable forms will become increasingly important. This will
enhance the interpretability and reliability of the model and improve trust in data-driven
decision-making processes.
In conclusion, self-supervised learning-based automated feature engineering is a piv-
otal research area for effectively understanding complex patterns in time series data and
enhancing predictive performance. Research combining this approach with data efficiency
improvements, multimodal learning, and explainable AI (XAI) is expected to further
increase the practicality and reliability of TSF.
5.5 Model combination techniques
The instability of single models in time series forecasting has been a persistent challenge
from the past to the present. Due to the complexity, volatility, and distinguishing charac-
teristics of time series data, the use of a single model can lead to overfitting and unstable
forecasting performance. Therefore, methods for combining models offer a simple yet effec-
tive approach to overcome these issues. Model combination techniques reduce forecasting
uncertainty and enable more robust predictions. Makridakis et al (2020) experimentally
demonstrates that model combination, as applied in the M4 Competition task, improves
forecast accuracy over single models or model selection. However, Model combination
techniques can face issues such as model redundancy, increased computational costs, and
reduced interpretability due to the complexity of the combined models. To maximize the
combination effect, it is necessary to properly leverage model diversity or use sophisticated
combination methods.
5.5.1 Ensemble models
Ensemble models combine the independent predictions of several models to complement
the weaknesses of individual models and generate a final forecast. Ganaie et al (2022) sum-
marizes the theoretical aspects of ensemble learning’s success based on existing research,
1 3

216 Page 74 of 95 J. Kim et al.
Fig. 18 BKey ensemble techniques
arguing that combining predictions from multiple models is an effective way to improve
model performance. This section explores key ensemble methods, including bagging, boost-
ing, and stacking, as illustrated in Fig. 18.
Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) involves randomly sampling the data to train several
independent models and then combining their results through averaging or voting (Breiman
1996). Petropoulos et al (2018) explains why bagging is effective for time series forecasting
by addressing data uncertainty, model uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, improving
forecasting performance. Kim and Baek (2022) combines Wavelet transforms with bagging
techniques in MLP to improve univariate time series forecasting performance. Using the
Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) (Nason et al 2000), the signal
is decomposed, and bagging is applied only to the detail part, excluding trends. This creates
data diversity by preserving the main trend while altering the detailed fluctuations.
Boosting overcomes the issue of model diversity by sequential training and combining
weak learners (Freund and Schapire 1997). This approach addresses the diversity problem
that can arise in bagging when each model is trained in a very similar manner. Each model
places more weight on the data that was incorrectly predicted by the previous models, aim-
ing to reduce bias. This creates a strong learner by combining weak learners and ensures
added diversity. Gradient boosting is an algorithm that optimizes models using the gradient
of the loss function within the boosting framework (Friedman 2001). XGBoost (eXtreme
Gradient Boosting) executes the gradient boosting algorithm in parallel, making it faster
and more effective in handling sparse data while improving learning speed and predictive
performance (Chen and Guestrin 2016). In the 2015 Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com)
machine learning competition, 17 out of 29 winning solutions used XGBoost (Chen and
Guestrin 2016). As deep learning advanced, various works combining DL with XGBoost
emerged. LightGBM (Ke et al 2017) is a boosting-based algorithm with a leaf-wise tree
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 75 of 95 216
splitting method, and Sui et al (2024) uses an ensemble approach that combines traditional
and advanced methods for stock prediction. Specifically, the integration of LSTM, GRU,
LR, and LightGBM models enhances forecasting performance. However, boosting is gen-
erally not applied to deep learning models, as boosting typically uses simple weak learn-
ers that are repeatedly trained to improve performance. Deep learning models like MLP
already learn complex patterns effectively with large amounts of data, so the need for itera-
tive error correction is minimal. Thus, simpler machine learning methods are typically used
to construct weak learners instead of deep neural networks. Truchan et al (2024) proposes
predicting trends using linear models and then applying boosting to the residuals with tree-
based models for forecasting. This model combines the simple trend estimation capability
of linear models with the nonlinear pattern learning ability of tree-based models, achieving
more precise and effective predictions in LTSF. However, there is also a case where boosting
principles are applied to deep learning models, such as Liang et al (2024b), which integrates
boosting’s progressive residual learning approach into deep learning to enhance time series
forecasting.
Stacking combines the predictions of several models to generate a final forecast (Wolp-
ert 1992). Stacked Generalization involves training several base learners, and then feeding
their prediction results into a meta-model to generate the final prediction. Unlike bagging
and boosting, stacking does not directly combine the predictions of the models; instead, it
inputs the prediction results into a new model to make the final forecast. Stacking is dis-
tinctive in that it incorporates model weightings and analysis, enabling more refined and
comprehensive predictions (Sharma et al 2021). Massaoudi et al (2021) suggests stacking
LightGBM and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to tackle stochastic variations in short-
term load forecasting, where the meta data generated by both models is input to an MLP for
the final prediction. Furthermore, the use of MLP as a meta-model instead of traditional ML
models like linear regression enables the learning of more complex, nonlinear relationships,
improving prediction performance. The results demonstrate the model’s generalization abil-
ity and superior performance across various datasets. BStacking can be applied not only to
deterministic forecasting but also to probabilistic forecasting, and some studies have shown
that stacking is effective in handling uncertainty (Pavlyshenko 2020; Dudek 2024). Hasson
et al (2023) explores the theoretical aspects of stacked generalization. Through cross-vali-
dation, it provides theoretical guarantees that the performance of a stacked generalization
model selected through cross-validation does not fall significantly behind that of an oracle
model, the best performing individual model. The paper also explains that extending the
basic models used in stacking to learnable models, rather than constant models, provides
better theoretical guarantees.
Ensemble models require significant training resources since each model must be trained
independently. Nevertheless, ensemble techniques combine diverse, high-performance
models to complement each other and can be implemented in a relatively simple manner.
Due to these characteristics, ensemble learning can enhance prediction stability and gener-
alization capabilities in application fields, penetrating nearly all industries, from grain prod-
uct distribution, semiconductor manufacturing, and sensor design to commercial software
development and testing services (Lin and Huang 2022).

5.5.2 Hybrid models
Hybrid models combine different types of models or techniques to leverage the strengths of
individual models while compensating for their weaknesses. These models employ a more
sophisticated structural integration approach compared to ensembles, encompassing various
strategies such as combining statistical models, machine learning models, and deep learning
models.
ESRNN (Smyl 2020), a hybrid model that combines statistical models with deep learn-
ing architectures, integrates exponential smoothing (ES) and LSTM to leverage the inter-
pretability of statistical methods alongside the powerful nonlinear learning capabilities of
deep learning. Through ES, the model effectively captures key components of individual
time series, such as level, trend, and seasonality, while LSTM learns the correlations and
nonlinear patterns across multiple time series. Additionally, the use of dynamic compu-
tation graphs and a hierarchical design provides strong performance and interpretability
in real-world applications. This model highlights the potential of hybrid models for time
series forecasting with its superior performance. BMoreover, AQ-ESRNN (Smyl et al 2024)
model, an extension beyond deterministic forecasting to probabilistic forecasting, enables
distributional forecasting by quantifying prediction uncertainty. Subsequently, hybrid
models combining deep learning architectures have advanced, and this section focuses on
explaining such combinations of deep learning architectures.
Particularly, time series data often involve not only temporal dependencies but also
important interactions between variables. Therefore, many models explicitly learn the inter-
dependencies between variables in addition to temporal dependencies. However, incorpo-
rating all this information into a single architecture can lead to overfitting, which may limit
the learning process. Recent models often combine two or more architectures to efficiently
learn by distinguishing the roles based on the nature of the information.
WaveForM (Yang et al 2023a) improves prediction performance by transforming time
series data into the wavelet domain and combining it with GNN. The Discrete Wavelet
Transformation (DWT) uses High-Pass and Low-Pass Filters to decompose the time series
data into small wavelets. This process removes noise and allows CNN to efficiently cap-
ture temporal and frequency characteristics. The GNN is then used to model the interac-
tions between these components. TSLANet (Eldele et al 2024) is a model that replaces the
computationally expensive attention mechanism with CNN in the Transformer framework.
It incorporates frequency analysis and a learnable threshold to selectively attenuate high-
frequency noise, effectively learning long-term and short-term interactions. Additionally, it
uses parallel convolution layers with different kernel sizes to capture both local patterns and
long-term dependencies. This approach effectively compensates for the typical CNN’s limi-
tations in modeling long-term dependencies. DERITS (Fan et al 2024a) enhances the predic-
tion performance of non-stationary time series data by combining convolution operations
in the frequency domain with MLP in the time domain. The Frequency Derivative Trans-
formation (FDT) converts time series signals into the frequency domain and then differenti-
ates the frequency components to represent them in a static form that is easier to predict.
The Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network (OFCN) is responsible for frequency
filtering and learning dependencies in the frequency domain. To improve prediction perfor-
mance, it processes and fuses derivative information of various orders in parallel, utilizing
a Parallel-stacked Architecture. BiTGraph (Chen et al 2024c) focuses on improving perfor-

mance in situations with missing data by capturing both temporal dependencies and spatial
structures. The Multi-Scale Instance Partial TCN module learns short-term and long-term
dependencies through kernels of various sizes and can also compensate for missing values
through partial TCN. The Biased GCN module for inter-channel relationship learning rep-
resents the relationships between data points as a graph structure and adjusts the strength
of information propagation between nodes, considering the missing patterns. Zhang et al
(2021a) proposes a hybrid model for wind speed forecasting. By performing decomposition
using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition
(MEMD), the model removes noise and separates the trend and various frequency compo-
nents of the time series data, enabling more accurate forecasting. Then, by combining CNN
with attention mechanism and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, the model extracts
spatial correlations and learns temporal dependencies, optimizing the wind speed forecast-
ing performance. Zhang et al (2021b) also uses both ensemble and hybrid models for TSF.
The ensemble deep learning model, which combines various deep learning models such as
CNN, MLP, and LSTM, demonstrates excellent performance in forecasting real-world time
series data, including PM2.5 concentration, wind speed, and electricity prices. The model
utilizes Extended AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire 1997) to generate diverse base predictors,
followed by applying a stacking method to use Kernel Ridge Regression as a meta-predictor
to produce the final forecast.
In hybrid models, optimization processes such as hyperparameter tuning, regulariza-
tion techniques, and cross-validation can help reduce the risk of overfitting caused by the
interdependence and complexity between multiple models. Additionally, evolutionary algo-
rithms can be used to explore and optimize model structures (Wei et al 2022). Hybrid mod-
els may increase training time and resource consumption, and they can have limitations in
interpretability and maintenance. Therefore, techniques like model compression or feature
selection can be applied, and model interpretability issues can be addressed using interpreta-
tion methods.
5.6 Interpretability and explainability
Although AI models exhibit outstanding performance, their black-box nature often under-
mines trust in decision-making processes (Xua and Yang 2024). In mission-critical domains,
particularly those dealing with human life and safety, understanding the reasons behind
model decisions is crucial, which has led to restrictions on the use of deep learning models
(Papapetrou and Lee 2024). The European Union, through the General Data Protection Reg-
ulation (GDPR), mandates the explanation of automated decisions, ensuring that individuals
can understand the rationale behind decisions made by automated systems like AI models
(Hamon et al 2022). As data-driven decision-making becomes more widespread, the need
to understand how a model arrives at specific predictions and why such outcomes occur is
growing (Lim and Zohren 2021).
Interpretability and explainability aim to ensure model understanding and transparency,
making it possible to know how and why a model produces certain results. These two con-
cepts can be applied in various ways. For example, consumers might demand explanations
when they notice anomalies in model outcomes, while AI researchers could use these con-
cepts to improve model performance. Ultimately, interpretability and explainability pro-
mote not only research on AI models but also their expansion into various fields, enhancing
1 3

216 Page 78 of 95 J. Kim et al.
performance and usability, which could drive fundamental changes in industries and soci-
etal paradigms (Han et al 2023a; Jung et al 2020; Kim et al 2020).
These concepts are particularly important in time series data, where interpretability helps
in understanding how a model recognizes and predicts periodic and repetitive patterns. Fur-
thermore, explainability is necessary for anomaly detection models to clarify how anoma-
lies are detected and which features are abnormal, thereby aiding decision-making.
The machine learning community has noted that there is no universally agreed-upon
definition for the terms interpretability and explainability (Lipton 2018). Consequently, in
various studies, these terms are often used interchangeably, even though they carry different
meanings and are used differently across domains (Graziani et al 2023). To avoid confu-
sion for our readers, we define and explain these terms as follows. Interpretability focuses
on understanding the internal workings of a model, providing transparency about how the
model makes predictions (ŞAHiN et al 2024). Interpretability requires an intuitive under-
standing of the model’s structure, feature selection, and prediction process. Explainability,
on the other hand, is concerned with providing reasons for a model’s outputs in a way that
humans can comprehend. It is a technical approach that helps make the decision-making
process of the model more understandable. In summary, interpretability is about understand-
ing how the model works, while explainability is about providing understandable reasons
for the model’s predictions.
5.6.1 Interpretability
Interpretability can be achieved through the following representative models. Temporal
Fusion Transformer (TFT) (Lim et al 2021) is a deep learning model for multi-horizon fore-
casting proposed by the Google Cloud AI team, which utilizes the attention mechanism to
effectively learn the interactions between static and time-dependent input data. This model
incorporates a static feature encoder, a variable selection gating mechanism, and interpre-
table weights, allowing the model to better capture the characteristics of time series data
and significantly improve interpretability compared to a standard Transformer. The gating
mechanism suppresses unnecessary inputs, enhancing model efficiency, while the static fea-
ture encoder converts static data into contextual vectors that are incorporated into predic-
tions. The following two models enhance the interpretability of the TFT model for wind
speed prediction by applying a two-stage decomposition approach. Given the high volatility
and multi-resolution modes of wind speed data, the decomposition technique described in
Sect. 5.4.1 allows for the independent analysis of the impact of each component on the
prediction results, thus improving interpretability. EMD-EEMD-JADE-TFT decomposes
the data using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EEMD) and optimizes the TFT’s hyperparameters using Adaptive Dif-
ferential Evolution with optional external archive (JADE) (Wu and Wang 2024). IEEMD-
EWT-JADE-TFT model, on the other hand, uses Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical
Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (IEEMD) and Empirical Wavelet Transform
(EWT) for decomposition, and similarly optimizes TFT hyperparameters with JADE (Wu
et al 2024a). Additionally, meteorological feature engineering combines statistical features
to enhance both performance and interpretability.

5.6.2 Explainability
Different methodologies exist for models focused on explainability. Simple machine learn-
ing models, such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees, are transparent and provide an
intuitive understanding of predictions by themselves. These models have intrinsic explain-
ability, which falls under ante-hoc explainability, meaning their predictions can be easily
explained from the design stage. On the other hand, deep learning models are highly com-
plex and learn high-dimensional features, making it difficult to achieve intrinsic explainabil-
ity through simple aggregation methods. Therefore, post-hoc explainability techniques are
primarily used for deep learning models. Post-hoc explainability refers to approaches that
interpret and explain the prediction or decision-making process after the model has already
been trained. Post-hoc interpretability can be divided into several subcategories.
Surrogate models are used to explain the predictions of complex models by training a
simpler, interpretable model to explain the predictions. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanations (LIME) is a representative surrogate model that provides local explanations
for individual predictions (Ribeiro et al 2016). LIME works by generating perturbated sam-
ple data around a data point and obtaining predictions from the black-box model. Based on
this, a simple linear model is trained to identify the important features in that prediction.
Yang et al (2023b) proposes an improved LIME algorithm to address the interpretability
issues of black-box models in wind power forecasting and applies it to a wind power predic-
tion model. This model introduces a trust index to quantify how reliable the features used by
the prediction model are and analyzes how the black-box model handles important features
in the prediction. Additionally, this model proposes global trust modeling and interpretable
feature selection methods, demonstrating that these approaches can enhance the model’s
reliability and reduce prediction errors.
Feature attribution is a method that calculates how much each input feature contributed
to the model’s prediction and evaluates the contribution of input features for a specific
prediction. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a representative feature attribution
technique based on the Shapley value concept from game theory (Lundberg and Lee 2017).
SHAP fairly measures the contribution of each feature to model predictions. SHAP visu-
alizes the importance of features from both global and local perspectives and helps iden-
tify interactions between model predictions and features. The key idea behind SHAP is to
compute the average contribution of each feature across all possible feature combinations,
which allows the decomposition of predictions into feature contributions, providing intui-
tive and interpretable results. García and Aznarte (2020) uses an LSTM model to predict
NO2 concentrations and presents a method for interpreting the prediction results based on
SHAP. While SHAP values are typically applied to linear models, this study extends SHAP
by applying Deep SHAP to accommodate the nonlinear characteristics of deep learning
models, making it easier to understand the complex decision-making process of deep learn-
ing models (Chen et al 2022).
Counterfactual explanations describe what inputs need to be altered to change a specific
prediction (Wachter et al 2017). Counterfactual explanations generate counterfactual inputs
that would alter the prediction. In time series research, counterfactual explanations have
been widely used in classification tasks, but their application to forecasting models has
been relatively underexplored (Wang et al 2023b). In time series forecasting, exogenous
variables make predictions more complex, which highlights the importance of setting range
1 3

216 Page 80 of 95 J. Kim et al.
constraints (Papapetrou and Lee 2024). ForecastCF is a model that generates counterfactual
explanations to explain the predictions of time series forecasting models (Wang et al 2023b).
This model modifies the time series data through gradient-based perturbation to ensure the
model’s predictions fall within a specified range, thus improving the model’s explainability.
Specifically, users define the desired prediction range, and the model generates predictions
that satisfy these constraints, making the predictions more intuitive and understandable.
5.7 Spatio-temporal time series forecasting
As the structure of time series data becomes increasingly complex, spatial information is
now frequently incorporated into the datasets. Spatio-temporal time series data refers to
datasets that simultaneously capture temporal variations and spatial distributions. This type
of data consists of values that change over time at specific locations, possessing both spatial
interactions and temporal dependencies. Due to these characteristics, it provides critical
information not only from patterns extracted along the time axis but also from spatial depen-
dencies caused by interactions between locations. For example, region-based traffic flow, air
pollution levels, climate change, and electricity consumption are representative cases. The
rapid advancements in technologies such as satellite data and GPS have led to an explo-
sive increase in location-based data. Therefore, spatio-temporal data modeling has become
increasingly important, as many real-world problems cannot be adequately explained by
temporal variations alone (Sun et al 2024a). Conventional multivariate time series models
often fail to adequately address spatial correlations or network structures, necessitating their
extension to spatio-temporal models. To address this, numerous approaches utilizing GNNs
and Transformers have been actively explored (Jin et al 2023; Yang et al 2024a; Chen et al
2021a; Park et al 2020).
Several representative approaches for handling spatio-temporal data are as follows. One
is the Graph-Based Method for spatio-temporal modeling. Data is represented as a graph,
where spatial relationships between locations (nodes) are expressed as edges. GCNs or
graph-based RNNs are used to simultaneously learn spatial and temporal dependencies.
This approach effectively models non-euclidean structured data but has drawbacks, such
as complex preprocessing and high computational costs. These approaches are well-suited
for applications such as traffic flow prediction by modeling road networks or electricity
demand forecasting by modeling connections between substations. DCRNN (Li et al 2018)
models traffic networks as directed graphs using Diffusion Convolution, effectively captur-
ing spatial dependencies, including upstream and downstream node relationships. It also
leverages GRU to capture temporal patterns and non-linearities, making it a representative
graph-based model for handling complex time series data. ST-GCN (Yan et al 2018) mod-
els skeleton dataset as graphs and extends GCN along the temporal axis to simultaneously
model spatial and temporal dependencies. DB-STGCN (Li et al 2024a) predicts train delays
by integrating dynamic adjacency matrices generated through Dynamic Bayesian Networks
(DBN) into ST-GCN to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. It improves prediction accu-
racy and interpretability through the integration of attention mechanisms and the combina-
tion of GCN and GRU.
Another approach is the raster-based method. Data is converted into a 2D grid (raster) or
video format to learn spatial locations and temporal patterns. Grid-based data representa-
tion: A specific space is divided into grids, and data over time is collected for each grid cell.
1 3

A comprehensive survey of deep learning for time series forecasting:… Page 81 of 95 216
Video-based data representation: Data is transformed into a 3D tensor, including the time
axis. This format allows easy application of image processing techniques, such as CNNs,
and 3D CNNs are particularly effective for directly learning spatio-temporal patterns. How-
ever, there are limitations in learning overly complex spatial relationships. They are suit-
able for modeling climate data from satellite imagery or recognizing actions in video data
through spatiotemporal dynamics. ConvLSTM (Shi et al 2015) replaces the fully connected
state transitions of conventional LSTM with convolutions to learn spatial correlations, mak-
ing it a representative early raster-based method. It represents all inputs, hidden states, and
cell states as 3D tensors to maintain the grid-like spatial structure. ST-ResNet (Zhang et al
2017) models citywide crowd flows based on residual learning. It partitions the city into a
grid structure and represents the inflow and outflow of each grid cell as 2-channel image
data. Residual networks are employed to effectively learn interactions between both nearby
and distant regions. SLCNN (Zhang et al 2020) utilizes Structure Learning Convolution
(SLC) to define graphs as learnable parameters for the effective modeling of both global
static structures and dynamic structures within datasets. It replaces conventional CNN con-
volutions with SLC tailored to graph structures, generating graph-specific representations
at each layer.
Recently, there have also been efforts to combine graph-based and raster-based method-
ologies to more effectively model both spatial structures and temporal dependencies. They
are ideal for representing traffic flow as graphs and enabling detailed analysis of each node
in smart city data. GMAN (Zheng et al 2020) effectively learns the dynamic spatio-temporal
relationships in traffic networks through Spatio-Temporal Embedding (STE) and ST-Atten-
tion Block. It utilizes spatial attention to capture dynamic relationships between sensors,
temporal attention to learn nonlinear temporal patterns, and gated fusion to integrate these
features seamlessly. STSGCN (Song et al 2020) employs the Spatial-Temporal Synchro-
nous Graph Convolutional Module (STSGCM) to synchronize and learn spatial and tem-
poral dependencies. It constructs a localized spatial-temporal graph to model relationships
between neighboring nodes within the same time frame and nodes from past or future time
frames simultaneously. GCN-SBULSTM (Chen et al 2021b) proposes a model that com-
bines GCN with Stacked Bidirectional Unidirectional LSTM (SBULSTM). The Bidirec-
tional LSTM captures temporal patterns, while GCN learns spatial dependencies, enabling
integrated modeling of spatio-temporal interactions. Additionally, sequence-based methods
process spatio-temporal data in sequence form, focusing primarily on temporal dynamics.
The primary objective of spatio-temporal time series prediction models is to address
the challenging task of integrating complex data structures while simultaneously learning
temporal dependencies and spatial interactions. This enables accurate future state prediction
and helps solve various real-world problems, facilitating precise decision-making.
6 Conclusion
This survey has been prepared to broaden the expertise of existing researchers and to assist
beginners in gaining a fundamental understanding amid the rapid growth of time series fore-
casting (TSF) research. By integrating key concepts of time series and the latest techniques,
we aim to provide researchers with clear direction and insights, fostering the continued
advancement of this field. This survey paper comprehensively reviews recent advancements
1 3

in TSF, focusing on deep learning models. It also incorporates key papers from major AI
and ML conferences, as well as several notable papers from the arXiv preprint repository
(https://arxiv.org).
TSF is a highly regarded topic, gradually expanding from the prominence of Transformer
models to various architecture-based models. Fundamental deep learning models like
MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs are being reassessed, and Transformers are also advanc-
ing by overcoming their previous limitations. Additionally, innovative models like Mamba
are emerging, and models such as Diffusion are also entering the field, experiencing rapid
growth. Furthermore, as the demand for foundation models in the field of TSF intensi-
fies, pre-trained models based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging. To create
a powerful predictive model, researchers need to be aware of these trends and understand
both the characteristics of time series data and the strengths and weaknesses of different
architectures.
Taking it a step further, we aim to address common challenges in TSF and provide deep
insights into future development directions. In particular, we reviewed various studies that
focus on approaches to channel correlation and address the challenges of distribution shift,
which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we emphasized the need for
research that leverages causality to eliminate spurious correlations, thereby enabling a
deeper understanding of the underlying essence. We also discussed the importance of stud-
ies focused on effectively extracting features from complex time series data. In addition, we
explored model combination techniques aimed at enhancing model performance, as well as
spatio-temporal TSF problems to address complex real-world issues. Furthermore, we pro-
vided insights into improving model reliability by addressing interpretability and explain-
ability. Through this, we aim to present readers with potential directions for future research.
Limitations and future work
This survey acknowledges several limitations that could be addressed in future research.
● We skipped the detailed theoretical backgrounds of the models. This survey aims to
provide a comprehensive overview, facilitating comparison and analysis, thereby allow-
ing researchers to explore areas of interest more effectively. Although comprehensive
information is primarily provided, readers can access additional details through refer-
ence links if needed.
● We left the specific differences in characteristics across various time series datasets for
future work. Time series data is often domain-specific, requiring expert knowledge,
which can be integrated into models to enhance performance. This underscores the im-
portance of interdisciplinary collaboration, and future research should continue to de-
velop in this direction. By integrating insights from a wide range of academic fields into
TSF, it can contribute to the development of robust and generalized models.
● The aspect of expanding Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Adaptive Modeling
could be further explored. Research on techniques such as meta-learning, reinforce-
ment learning, and neuro-symbolic AI can enhance the generalization and adaptability
of models. In the current TSF field, time series-specific models and deep learning-based
standard methodologies are dominant. However, as TSF problems become increasingly
complex, research on generalization and adaptability holds great potential.

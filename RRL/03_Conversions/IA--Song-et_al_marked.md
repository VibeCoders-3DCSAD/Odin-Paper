1 Introduction
1.1 Objective
Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in numerous applications, such as energy con-
sumption (Wu et al. 2021; Guo et al. 2023; Son and Van Cuong 2023; Dinh et al. 2023),
transportation planning (Venkateshwari et al. 2023; Hu and Xiong 2023; Chen et al. 2023)
and weather forecasting (Ma et al. 2023; Mung and Phyu 2023; Chen et al. 2023). In these
practical application scenarios, forecasting future time series with the help of historical data

is of great significance for long-term planning and early warning in related fields (Wang et
al. 2023; Miller et al. 2024). This process can be shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, this paper aims
to explore deep learning-based time series forecasting models from multiple perspectives,
offering a comprehensive evaluation of current mainstream models and encouraging readers
to consider future directions for development in this field.
1.2 Review of existing approaches
Next, we will summarize the existing methods from four main perspectives: time-step
dependencies, correlations between temporal variables, the trade-off between expanding the
model’s receptive field and reducing computational costs, and loss functions.
Time series information usually consists of time-step dependencies and correlations
between temporal variables (Parzen 1961; Lacasa et al. 2015; Hsieh 2004; Orang et al.
2023). Fully exploiting these two types of information plays a crucial role in improving the
model’s capability. Traditional models like the autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) (Zhang 2003; Ariyo et al. 2014; Contreras et al. 2003) rely on statistical proper-
ties to extract information. However, they often fall short in fully capturing the time-step
dependencies within complex time series. This is because traditional models primarily focus
on linear features, while real-time series data usually contains intricate nonlinear correla-
tions. As a result, traditional models struggle to adequately leverage these dependencies.
In recent years, with the development of algorithms related to deep lCR121earning and the
improvement of computational power, deep learning-based methods have become increas-
ingly crucial in time series forecasting. Autoencoder and Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) (Lv
et al. 2014) are utilized to extract the time-step features of the time series and obtain the pre-
diction results directly. (CNNs) (Gudelek et al. 2017; Markova 2022; Lu et al. 2020; Zhao
et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018; Hatami et al. 2018) are often used to extract time-series features
in the short-term range because of their ability to aggregate time-step data in the receptive
field. To capture a broader range of temporal dependencies, the Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) (Bai et al. 2018) expands the receptive field of its convolutional kernel.
Specifically, TCN introduces dilated causal convolutions to time-series forecasting tasks. In
1 3

contrast, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Shi et al. 2015; Dey and Salem 2017; Sali-
nas et al. 2020; Hajirahimi and Khashei 2023; Lai et al. 2018) are specialized for temporal
sequences and, theoretically, do not suffer from the limited receptive fields characteristic of
CNNs. However, related studies have shown that the recurrent structure of RNNs can lead
to issues such as vanishing gradient, limiting their ability to leverage long-term dependen-
cies in time series. To address this, researchers have developed models like Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) (Shi et al. 2015; Fischer and Krauss 2018; Zheng et al. 2017) and
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Dey and Salem 2017), which employ gating mechanisms
to better capture long-term temporal correlations. Despite these advancements, LSTM and
GRU models still face challenges, such as vanishing gradient (Pascanu et al. 2013; Noh
2021; Le and Zuidema 2016) and error accumulation during training (Tang et al. 2021; Fan
et al. 2019; Liao et al. 20185), which are common in RNN architectures. The effectiveness
(Hewamalage et al. 2021; Pavlov-Kagadejev et al. 2024) of RNN-based forecasting models
declines with longer forecasting time steps.
Given the exceptional performance of Transformer models in both natural language pro-
cessing (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018) and image processing (Dosovitskiy et al.
2020) domains, these models are now being introduced to time series forecasting (Wu et al.
2021; Li et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021). Compared with RNN-based models, Transformer
based models adopt an encoder-decoder structure (Wang et al. 2022; Woo et al. 2022; Lee et
al. 2024) and the attention mechanism (Liu et al. 2023; Niu et al. 2021; Young et al. 2022).
It can dramatically alleviate the error accumulation (Li et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021) in long-
term time-series forecasting tasks. However, the authors of DLinear (Yun et al. 2019) point
out that the attention mechanism is permutation invariance. The Transformer model does
not make good use of time series order information. To solve this problem, DLinear uses a
linear layer to implement time series forecasting.
Generally speaking, the correlation between time steps in a time series comprises mul-
tiple patterns (Cleveland et al. 1990; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018; Dagum 2010),
including trend (Verbesselt et al. 2010) [62] (Qi and Zhang 2008; Woodward and Gray
1993), seasonal patterns (Bell and Hillmer 1984; De Livera et al. 2011), etc. To reduce the
complexity of time series forecasting and capture these temporal patterns, some models
have introduced time series decomposition techniques (Wu et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2022;
Oreshkin et al. 2019; Woo et al. 2022). These approaches initially decompose the time
series into several components, usually containing trend information, seasonal information,
time-scale information (Taylor and Letham 2018; Jiang et al. 2021; Murray et al. 2000),
and other time-series information. Subsequently, the model analyzes these distinct elements
using specialized modules. For instance, Autoformer (Wu et al. 2021) utilizes a mean filter
to convolve the input sequence, extracting trend terms that represent the time series’ trend
patterns. Similarly, Fedformer (Zhou et al. 2022) employs multiple mean filters of varying
sizes to derive trend terms, effectively addressing the limited receptive field issue. LSTnet
(Lai et al. 2018) employs linear mapping to extract trend information from sequences and
incorporates a predefined window to minimize the impact of distant information on trend
forecasting. N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2019) adopts a polynomial fitting method to model
the time series’ trend terms. Similarly, both DLinear (Yun et al. 2019) and TDformer (Zhang
et al. 2022) utilize shallow linear layers for this purpose. For seasonal information, LSTnet
introduces a skip-connection architecture based on LSTM, enabling the model to account
for information from time steps preceding a fixed interval, thereby capturing seasonal infor-
1 3

mation in the data. Autoformer enhances the ability of the attention mechanism to discern
seasonal patterns by using time-delayed similarities of the input. Fedformer, on the other
hand, transforms the input time series into the frequency domain and employs an attention
mechanism to analyze similarities between frequency components, effectively capturing the
periodicity of the time series. ETSformer (Woo et al. 2022) filters frequency components
based on their magnitude, reducing noise interference in seasonal information capturing.
Time-scale information (Zhai et al. 2023), referring to the correlation of time steps at dif-
ferent scales, is addressed by models like Scaleformer (Shabani et al. 2022) and Pyraformer
(Liu et al. 2021). The former applies downsampling to acquire inputs at various temporal
scales and uses a forecasting model for multi-scale predictions. The latter processes time
series at different scales and employs an attention mechanism to derive cross-scale attention
correlations.
In addition to time-step dependencies, the essence of time series information also lies in
the cross-time-step correlations among variables (Chakraborty et al. 1992; Yin et al. 2019).
Thus, feature extraction of time series variables and exploring the inter-variable correlations
are crucial for accurate forecasting. The TFT (Lim et al. 2021) employs RNN for feature
extraction from time series variables and incorporates a feature filtering module to identify
and utilize valuable information within these features. Aliformer (Qi et al. 2021) catego-
rizes input time-series variables and incorporates future information about these variables,
enhancing the model’s forecasting capabilities. Crossformer (Zhang and Yan 2022) lever-
ages the attention mechanism to analyze attention-based correlations between variables,
offering a nuanced approach to understanding their interplay. It is worth noting that in recent
years, with the development of large language models(LLMS) (Zhao et al. 2023) like Chat-
GPT (Achiam et al. 2023), LLMs can directly or indirectly generate prediction sequences
through prompt engineering (Liang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024).
CNN models are constrained by their limited receptive field, hindering their ability to
effectively capture long-term time series data (Tang et al. 2020; Gál et al. 2004; Luo et al.
2016). The RNN model, due to the problems of error accumulation, vanishing gradient, and
exploding gradient, also cannot handle the long-term time series prediction task well. While
Transformer models circumvent these issues, the attention mechanism’s computational cost
grows quadratically with the series length, rendering the traditional Transformer impractical
for long-term forecasting (Li et al. 2019). Therefore, some research is devoted to reduc-
ing the computational cost of the attention mechanism, primarily through sparse attention
mechanisms or shortening time series length. Related studies based on the sparse attention
mechanism include: LogTrans (Li et al. 2019) filters the target of attention computation
based on the distance between time steps, reducing computation. Reformer (Kitaev et al.
2020) maps the data into a hash space and filters the target of attention computation based
on the distance among time steps in the hash space. Informer (Zhou et al. 2021) filters the
target of attention computation based on computational output distribution. Related studies
on reducing series length include: Informer utilizes convolutional aggregation of time steps
in the receptive field. Convolutional aggregation reduces the input series length of the atten-
tion mechanism. PatchTST (Nie et al. 2022) slices long sequences into multiple fixed-size
patches, reducing the attention mechanism’s computational cost.
Regarding loss function, the above deep learning-based models commonly use Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the gap between predic-
tions and actual outcomes (Li et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021; Kitaev et al. 2020; Zhou et
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 5 of 67 23
al. 2022; Oreshkin et al. 2019). However, using MAE or MSE as the sole optimization
objective has some limitations (Goodfellow et al. 2014; Mogren 2016; Lyu et al. 2019).
In response, several models have innovated upon the traditional loss function to address
this issue. For instance, DeepAR (Salinas et al. 2020) converts the model output from spe-
cific values to probability distributions, using negative log-likelihood as its loss function.
Similarly, SSDNet (Lin et al. 2021) integrates negative log-likelihood with MAE to form a
hybrid loss function, allowing for the assessment of discrepancies in both value and prob-
ability terms. AST (Wu et al. 2020) employs a strategy inspired by the training mechanism
of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014), comprising both dis-
criminant loss and generative loss components. This approach facilitates the alignment of
the predicted distribution with the actual data distribution.
Deep learning architectures usually require large-scale labeled datasets for achieving
good performance on forecasting time series. Recent techniques of self-supervised learn-
ing (Pöppelbaum et al. 2022; Jaiswal et al. 2020) have opened up new a research frontier
where deep learning architectures can learn general features from unlabeled time series.
The task of self-supervised learning is usually accomplished with some sort of time-series
augmentation such as flipping, random noise, time warping, and random smoothing. Based
on these data augmentation methods (Wen et al. 2020; Cui 2016) and the strategy of contras-
tive training (Pöppelbaum et al. 2022; Al-Tahan and Mohsenzadeh 2021), deep learning-
based time-series prediction models can capture temporal features during the pre-training
phase. Subsequently, with a small amount of labeled data, they train the predictor to carry
out predictions. At the same time, recent technology has also leveraged Few-Shot Learn-
ing to address the challenge of limited large-scale labeled datasets. This approach involves
training the model on various public datasets, enabling it to extract time-series features
effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Such a strategy leads to enhanced
performance when applied to new datasets. Methods employing Few-Shot Learning can
be categorized into two distinct directions. In Direction 1, the Memory network (Weston
et al. 2014) approach is utilized. This involves encoding historical time-series data dur-
ing training and retrieving these encodings when presented with new time-series datasets.
This allows the model to identify similar patterns and make accurate predictions (Iwata
and Kumagai 2020). Direction 2 involves using pre-trained LLMs known for their robust
generalization abilities to generate precise predictions for time series data (Jin et al. 2023).

In this section, we will briefly introduce the background information essential for this survey.

2.2 Time series decomposition
Time-step dependencies usually consist of various correlations, such as trend and season
correlations. To more thoroughly explore these dependencies and simplify the forecasting
process, some forecasting models incorporate the concept of time series decomposition, an
approach rooted in traditional time series analysis (West 1997; Soltani 2002; Dagum 2010).
This analysis posits that any given time series X is composed of distinct components: a trend

term (T), indicative of the series’ long-term progression; a seasonal term (S), representing
systematic and predictable fluctuations tied to seasonal effects; a recurrent fluctuation term
(C), denoting periodic variations within a specific period of time; and an irregular fluctua-
tion term (N), which accounts for random variability in the data. Decomposition models
fall into two primary categories: additive and multiplicative. The additive model represents
the time series as the sum of the four components, i.e., X =T +S+C+N. While, for
the multiplicative model, an arbitrary time series can be expressed as X =T S C N.

3 The logic of time series information mining
In this section, we will review the development of models over the past decade, with the
processing logic of time series as the main storyline. Generally, the processing logic of mod-
els for time series can be categorized into two types: mining correlations among time steps
and mining correlations among variables.
3.1 Mining correlations among time steps
In this subsection, we introduce the models and methods used to extract correlations among
time steps. Specifically, these approaches can be categorized into two main types: holistic
mining and targeted information mining, such as extracting trend or seasonal patterns.
3.1.1 Holistic mining
Autoencoders (Lv et al. 2014) are effective in uncovering time-step dependencies in time
series. They typically consist of three components: an encoder, a decoder, and a predic-
tion module, with the workflow divided into pretraining and prediction phases. During the
pretraining phase, the encoder extracts features that are fed into the decoder, which then
reconstructs the input sequence to train the model parameters. In the prediction phase, the
extracted features are input into the predictor, generating the forecasted sequence. In con-
trast, DLinear (Yun et al. 2019) uses a single linear layer to map the input vector’s dimen-
sion directly to the desired output dimension. Due to the simplicity of autoencoders and
linear layers, they are generally considered inadequate for fully capturing time-step depen-
dencies in time series.
Given the success of CNNs in the image processing domain (He et al. 2016; Krizhevsky
et al. 2017; Szegedy et al. 2015), they are also frequently utilized to identify temporal fea-
tures in time series (Markova 2022; Lu et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2017). Through convolution
and pooling operations, CNNs aggregate temporal information within their receptive field to
uncover internal time-step dependencies. However, due to the inherently limited receptive
field, CNNs primarily extract short-term and discontinuous dependencies. To broaden the
receptive field of CNNs and uncover dependencies across a wider range, Temporal Con-
volutional Networks (TCN) incorporate Dilated Causal Convolution (DCC) into the CNN
architecture. Dilated convolution extends the receptive field without altering the convolu-
tion kernel’s size (Yu and Koltun 2015; Yazdanbakhsh and Dick 2019), allowing CNNs
to capture more extensive time-step relationships. Furthermore, TCN enhances dilated
convolution with temporal causality, ensuring that each time step’s output is only influ-

enced by preceding inputs. The operational intricacies of DCC, TCN’s central component,
are depicted in Fig. 2, showcasing how dilated causal convolution effectively satisfies the
demands of temporal sequence analysis.
Meanwhile, in order to capture time-step dependencies, researchers have proposed
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series forecasting, drawing upon the distinc-
tive characteristics of time-series data (Shelatkar et al. 2020; Amalou et al. 2022; Tang et
al. 2021). RNNs, utilizing their recurrent connections, enable the features of a preceding
time step to act as inputs for the current step, thereby encapsulating the temporal attri-
butes of each step with information from its antecedents. Unconstrained by the receptive
field, RNNs theoretically can capture more extensive time-step correlations. However, the
increased span of these recurrent connections may lead to problems like gradient explo-
sion and vanishing. To counter these issues, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Shi et al.
2015; Fischer and Krauss 2018) units introduce a gate mechanism and cell states within
the RNN framework. Cell states hold crucial information for long durations, while the gate
mechanism-comprising input, output, and forget gates-regulates the flow of information.
The input gate controls the incorporation of current input into the cell state, the forget gate
determines the retention of cell memory, and the output gate dictates the utilization of cell
information for current output, as depicted in Fig. 3. Thus, for a given input time step xxx t,
LSTM’s output can be formulated as follows:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
for the output gates.
The gated structure allows models to selectively retain information from past time steps
along with current features (Weerakody et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2022). This helps mitigate
issues like gradient explosion and vanishing gradients and also reduces the impact of noise
in historical data. This capability allows LSTM units to extract long-term temporal informa-
tion more efficiently than traditional RNN models. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) simplifies
LSTM’s gate mechanism, which can be regarded as a simplified version of LSTM and
will not be introduced in detail here. For multi-step time series forecasting, RNN-based
models typically rely on autoregression for sequential prediction (Maggiolo and Spanakis
2019; Binkowski et al. 2018), using outputs from one step as inputs for the next. However,
this autoregressive approach may lead to error accumulation. Furthermore, as the sequence
length processed by the model increases, RNNs face amplified risks of gradient explosion
and error accumulation, challenges that gate mechanisms do not fully resolve.
Given its exceptional performance in both natural language and image processing
domains (Devlin et al. 2018; Vaswani et al. 2017), the Transformer model is frequently
employed to analyze general time-series data (Wen et al. 2022; Cai et al. 2020). As depicted
in Fig. 4, the Transformer mitigates error accumulation in long-term forecasting by uti-
lizing an encoder-decoder architecture. It encodes the temporal information of historical
time series via the encoder and then decodes this information with the decoder to produce
predictions. At the heart of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which initially
maps the input time series XXX into query QQQ, key KKK, and value VVV matrices. Subsequently,
it computes a similarity matrix between QQQ and KKK and adjusts VVV accordingly. Therefore,
the Attention mechanism’s output, OOO =Atten(XXX,XXX,XXX), is determined by the following
process:
|     | QQQ=WWW |           | XXX, KKK | =WWW XXX, | VVV =WWW | XXX,      |     |     |

similarity correlations between time steps.
In Fig. 4, the encoder layer of the Transformer encodes the temporal dependencies within
the input time series, subsequently feeding the encoded data to the corresponding decoder
layer. This decoder layer then generates the forecasted sequence, leveraging the identified
temporal dependencies. Besides, the feed-forward module within both the encoder and
decoder consists of several fully connected layers. With multiple layers of encoders and
decoders stacked, the Transformer architecture can capture extensive long-term temporal
correlations. The core of Transformer in time series forecasting lies in storing the similar-
ity relationships between historical time steps and predicting future time steps based on
these relationships. It is worth noting that existing large language models(LLM) (Zhao et al.
2023) like ChatGPT (Achiam et al. 2023) can be directly used for time series forecasting.
Currently, large language models are commonly involved in time series forecasting in two
ways: (1) as a predictive model (Liang et al. 2024): directly achieving sequential prediction
based on prompt engineering (Mao et al. 2023; Shin et al. 2020), and (2) not as a predictive
model (Zhang et al. 2024): generating embeddings by taking in relevant text information
and using these embeddings as auxiliary variables input into the predictive model.
3.1.2 Targeted information mining
To further explore the correlations among time steps, some models leverage the concept of
time series decomposition by developing custom modules designed to extract targeted infor-
mation, such as trend or seasonal information. The final predictive output is then obtained
by integrating the forecasting results of various types of target information. Current deep
learning models that employ time series decomposition are listed in Table 1.
Trend Information Trend information represents the trend correlations exhibited by the
series across time steps, where the term “trend correlations” denotes the discernible persis-
tence and regularity of fluctuations between consecutive time steps within a defined scope
(Taylor and Letham 2018; Cleveland et al. 1990; Asadi and Regan 2020). In addressing the
attributes of trend information, Autoformer (Wu et al. 2021) employs a mean filter to extract
the trend features from the time series. This involves convolving the input time series with
a mean filter using a sliding window approach. However, due to the limited receptive field
of the mean filter, the trend information acquired through the sliding window method tends
to be discontinuous and localized. To mitigate this limitation, Fedformer (Zhou et al. 2022)
1 3

23 Page 12 of 67 X. Song et al.
devises a set of mean filters with varying receptive fields, yielding trend terms correspond-
ing to different forecasting horizons. Subsequently, the model assigns learnable weights to
aggregate the trend terms through weighted averaging. This approach enables Fedformer to
incorporate trend information spanning diverse forecasting horizons.
Since trend information is usually more stable on a local scale, the time step to be pre-
dicted is more correlated with trend information from closer historical time steps, while
data from distant steps are deemed less favorable for trend prediction (Li et al. 2019; Lai et
al. 2018). To mitigate the influence of distant data on trend predictions, LSTnet (Lai et al.
2018) incorporates a predefined window, confining trend predictions to temporal informa-
tion within the window nearest to the target prediction. Within this preset window, which
includes k time steps, LSTnet employs linear mapping to capture the linear relationships
within the sequence, subsequently leveraging autoregression to forecast the trend term.
Thus, LSTnet’s prediction of the trend term at time t is expressed as:
k 1
−
yyy t = WWW i xxx t k+i +bbb, (6)
−
i=0
(cid:31)
where yyy
t
RD denotes the prediction of the trend term at time t, xxx
t k+i
RD denotes
historical v ∈ alue of the time series at the (t − k+i)th time step, WWW i ∈ R −D × D ∈ is the weight
matrix and bbb RD is the bias. LSTnet employs autoregression to generate trend term pre-
∈
dictions for all target locations. Similarly, both TDformer (Zhang et al. 2022) and DLinear
(Yun et al. 2019) adopt linear mapping techniques for trend term prediction.However, linear
relationships inadequately characterize the trend information of time steps, leading to weak
interpretability of trend terms obtained through linear mapping. To address these issues,
N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2019) introduces the Trend Stack module, aimed at capturing the
trend information within time series data. This module primarily employs polynomial fitting
techniques to model the trend relationships between time steps. For the input sequence X,
the Trend Stack module initially employs a fully connected layer to extract time-series fea-
tures, obtaining parameters for polynomial fitting. Subsequently, it introduces the time vec-
tor ttt= [0,1,2, ··· ,(O − 1)] RO as the independent variable for the fitting process. The resulting
O ∈
trend term generated by the Trend Stack can be represented as:
h

O is the trend term gen ∈ erated by the Trend Stack. h is
the highest power in the polynomial fit, which is usually set to a small value (0<h<5) by
N-BEATS to prevent overfitting.While LSTnet mitigates the influence of distant informa-
tion on trend term prediction by implementing a preset window, it maintains uniform atten-
tion across time steps within this window. In contrast, ETSformer (Woo et al. 2022) posits
that data proximate to the prediction position holds greater significance in encoding trend
terms, prioritizing time steps in close proximity to the prediction location.
1 3

Exponentially weighted average enables the prediction of trend terms to pay more atten-
tion to those closer historical time steps (Hyndman et al. 2008; Ensafi et al. 2022), strength-
ening correlations among short-term time steps. ETSformer introduces the Exponential
Smoothing Attention (ESA) module, integrating the concept of exponential weighted aver-
aging into the attention mechanism. For the output OOO of the attention mechanism derived
from Equation (5), the operation of ESA can be expressed as:
t 1

|     |       |        | (cid:31) j=0 |            |             |     |
where 0<α<1 is the learnable smoothing parameter and v 0 denotes the learnable initial
state.The aforementioned models primarily capture the short-term trends within the time
series, inadvertently overlooking the influence of long-term trend information. To address
this limitation, PatchTST (Nie et al. 2022) draws inspiration from patch processing meth-
odologies prevalent in computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021), integrat-
ing the concept of patches into the attention mechanism. As depicted in Fig. 5, PatchTST
initially segments the input time series into fixed-length patches using a sliding window
approach. Subsequently, these patches serve as inputs to the attention mechanism. Unlike
traditional attention mechanisms, PatchTST does not focus on correlations among time steps
within the individual patch; instead, it treats each patch as a unit and employs the atten-
tion mechanism to assess the similarity between patches. These patches contain aggregated
information from short-term time steps, facilitating the exploration of long-term dependen-
cies within the time series. For the input sequence XXX, this process can be represented as:
XXX =Patch(XXX),QQQ =XXX WWW +bbb ,KKK =XXX WWW +bbb ,VVV =XXX WWW +bbb ,

information is very important in time series analysis (Edition et al. 2002; Rawat et al. 2019),
as it indicates the periodic behavior within the data, elucidating correlations between time
steps separated by fixed intervals. However, extracting seasonal information is often more
challenging than trend information due to the intricate periodicity inherent in time series
data. Approaches for predicting seasonal terms can be broadly categorized into two groups:
time domain-based methods and frequency domain-based methods. Time domain-based
methods directly model the complex periodicity within the time domain (Lai et al. 2018;
Wu et al. 2021). In contrast, frequency domain-based methods first transform the input time
series into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform (Zhou et al. 2022; Woo et al.
2022; Zhang et al. 2022), then identify complex periodicities based on frequency compo-
nents. In the following, we will delve into the seasonal terms mining approaches in both the
time and frequency domains.
1 3

23 Page 14 of 67 X. Song et al.
To enable RNNs to capture seasonal information within time series data, LSTnet (Lai
et al. 2018) introduces a recurrent-skip network that contains skip connections. Incorporat-
ing skip connections facilitates direct interaction between time steps separated by a pre-
defined interval. As depicted in Fig. 6, LSTnet initially assumes a potential period p for the
input sequence. Subsequently, connections are established between the tth time step and the
(t p)th time step within the RNN. The update of the hidden layer state at the tth time step
−
encompasses information from the (t p)th time step, the current input, and the hidden
−
layer state from the previous time step. The skip-connected RNN allows the state update at
each time step to fully consider the information of the time steps before a fixed time interval.
The skip-connected RNN necessitates preset timing periods p and can only be utilized
to extract a single periodic relation, rendering LSTnet inadequate for analyzing time series
exhibiting intricate periodic patterns. To address this limitation and capture the complex
periodic relations inherent in time series data, Autoformer (Wu et al. 2021) introduces the
Auto-Correction module. This module aims to assess the time-delay similarity among input
sequences to characterize the periodicity of the original sequences, where time-delay simi-
larity denotes the likeness between time-delayed sequences and the original ones. Time-
delayed sequences are shifted by τ time steps. Autoformer posits that if a time-delayed
sequence with a τ-step delay exhibits significant similarity to the original sequence, τ can
be considered a period of the original sequence. To capture these complex period relations,
as depicted in Fig. 7, the Auto-Correction module initially employs Roll(,τ) to shift the
·
input sequence by a length of τ, subsequently evaluating the similarity between the delayed
sequence and the original one. This similarity is then utilized as a weighting factor to aver-
age and aggregate the time-delayed sequence, thereby generating the seasonal terms of the
sequence. Thus, for the input time series X, the Auto-Correction process can be delineated
as:

where xxx t denotes the tth time step of the input time series, R XXX (τ) denotes the similarity
between the original sequence X and its delayed sequence by a time delay of τ time steps.
τ 1 , ,τ k represent k time delays of the delayed sequence that has the highest similarity to
···
the original sequence. Autoformer leverages the similarity of time delays to extract the peri-
odicity inherent in the input time series. It approximates the complexity of the time series’
periods by utilizing multiple time delays of different degrees.
According to the Fourier series (Mathieu et al. 2013; Celeghini et al. 2021), any periodic
signal can be expressed as a linear combination of sinusoids with different frequencies.
Consequently, frequency domain-based processing involves transforming the time series
into the frequency domain via Fourier transform and subsequently analyzing the series in
this domain. Frequency domain-based seasonal term mining algorithms are able to analyze
the frequency components directly, thereby extracting complex period information from
the time series. Subsequently, we will delve into the seasonal term mining algorithm in the
frequency domain.
Fedformer (Zhou et al. 2022) adopts an approach by directly assessing the similarity
between frequency components within the frequency domain space. Fedformer introduces
the FEA (Frequency Enhanced Attention) module, which employs an attention mechanism
1 3

23 Page 16 of 67 X. Song et al.
to scrutinize frequency components in the frequency domain, thereby delving into the peri-
odic characteristics of the input time series.
In Fig. 8, the FEA module first transforms the input time series from the time domain to
the frequency domain using the Fourier transform F(). To mitigate computational costs
·
in the subsequent Attention mechanism and counteract the effects of noise, FEA employs
Select() to randomly sample frequency components in the frequency domain. Subsequently,
·
FEA applies the Attention mechanism to these selected frequency components, deriving
similarity relations among them and processing the components accordingly. Finally, FEA
returns the processed results to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform F − 1()
·
. Consequently, the FEA processing, based on the provided description and Equation (5),
can be expressed as:
QQQ˜ =Select(F(QQQ)), KKK˜ =Select(F(KKK)), VVV˜ =Select(F(VVV)), (14)
OOO˜ =Atten(QQQ˜,KKK˜,VVV˜), YYY S =F − 1(Padding(OOO˜)), (15)
where OOO˜ CI
×
Dk, I denotes the number of frequency components in the frequency domain.
∈
To fulfill the forecasting task, FEA requires padding the processing results in the frequency
domain using Padding() to ensure that the sequence meets length requirements.Since FEA
·
performs a random selection of frequency components in the frequency domain, there’s a
risk of losing crucial season information. To address this, ETSformer (Woo et al. 2022) fil-
ters frequency components based on their magnitudes, retaining the k components with the
highest magnitude. For seasonal term processing, ETSformer introduces the FA (Frequency
Attention) module. This module first transforms the input time series into the frequency
domain, preserving the k frequency components with the greatest magnitude. Subsequently,
the FA module returns the retained frequency components to the time domain via Fourier
inverse transform and outputs the predicted seasonal terms.
In contrast to Fedformer’s FEA module, ETSformer operates under the premise that noise
in time series data typically resides in frequency components with lower energy. Hence, it
prioritizes frequency components with higher magnitudes. Conversely, Fedformer assumes
noise may be present across all frequency components and thus employs random selection
for screening. TDformer’s (Zhang et al. 2022) approach to seasonal term processing is the
same as that of Fedformer. Meanwhile, DLinear (Yun et al. 2019) utilizes a single linear
layer to handle the seasonal terms.
To streamline the module for extracting seasonal terms, N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al. 2019)
simplifies its approach by exclusively processing specific frequencies within the frequency
domain. Specifically, N-BEATS introduces a Season Stack, which utilizes Fourier period
coding to analyze the seasonality of the time series. As depicted in Fig. 9, N-BEATS feeds
the input time series into the Season Stack. The stack utilizes a fully connected network
(FC) to derive Fourier period coding, representing the amplitudes of specific frequen-
cies. Subsequently, leveraging the Fourier period coding alongside the input time vector
ttt= [0,1,2, ··· ,(O − 1)] RO, the Season Stack employs Fourier series to predict the seasonal
O ∈
terms. Thus, the processing of seasonal terms can be expressed as:
θθθ =XXXWWW +BBB, (16)

the module’s task of extracting seasonal information.
Multi Scale Information: In addition to trend and seasonal information, models have begun
to target other time-series features such as multi-scale and non-stationary information.
Multi-scale information pertains to the temporal dependencies of a time series at different
scales (Shabani et al. 2022; Challu et al. 2023). For instance, considering hourly observa-
tions as the finest scale, coarser scales could represent daily, weekly, or even monthly pat-
terns within the time series. Integrating multi-scale temporal information enables models
to capture dependencies across various durations, crucial for accurate time series modeling
and forecasting.
To facilitate the capture of information across diverse time scales, Scaleformer (Shabani
et al. 2022) introduces a multi-scale iterative framework for time series forecasting. This
framework employs existing models (e.g., Autoformer, Fedformer) as the primary forecast-
ing model and applies filtering operations to transform the input time series into different
time scales. As illustrated in Fig. 10, Scaleformer comprises multiple processing layers,
with each layer’s inputs derived from downsampling the original inputs and upsampling
the outputs of the preceding layer. At the ith processing layer, Scaleformer first upsamples
the output of the preceding layer XXX out,i 1 to obtain UUU i . Simultaneously, it downsamples
the original input XXX using a scale factor − s i to obtain PPP i . These UUU i and PPP i are then nor-
malized across scales and fed into the forecasting model. The primary forecasting model
produces the processing result XXX out,i for the current layer, and the output of the final pro-
cessing layer yields the ultimate prediction YYY.
Since Scaleformer needs to get the prediction in different time scale iterations, the distri-
bution of the model’s intermediate variables can change dramatically, which may lead to the
accumulation and propagation of erroneous distributional information. In order to eliminate
the effect of time scale changes, Scaleformer will perform cross-scale normalization opera-
tions on inputs UUU
i
and PPP
i
at each processing layer. For UUU

(cid:31) (cid:31)
where µµµ i is the cross-scale mean coefficient of the ith layer, which is the mean of UUU i
and PPP . The cross-scale normalization operation is essentially a "zero-mean" operation on
i
UUU and PPP . Scaleformer enhances the primary prediction model’s ability to learn multi-
i i
scale time-series information by feeding time series of different time scales into the primary
prediction model.To enable the attention mechanism to focus on multi-scale time-series
information, Pyraformer (Liu et al. 2021) constructs a pyramid diagram comprising lay-
ers representing different time scales. Initially, Pyraformer processes the input time series
through convolution, aggregating time steps within a receptive field to generate coarser
time scales. As illustrated in Fig. 11, Pyraformer utilizes the original input time series as
the bottom layer of the pyramid diagram to represent the finest time scales. Subsequently,
it iteratively aggregates the bottom time steps via convolution, using the resultant coarse-
scale time series as the top layer of the pyramid graph. Pyraformer employs the Pyramidal
Attention Module (PAM) for nodes within the pyramid graph, enabling extraction of cross-
time scale features. Finally, depending on specific prediction task requirements, Pyraformer
feeds the features of the top nodes into different networks to obtain the final output. Hereaf-
ter, we delve into the principles of PAM.
In PAM, each node is only concerned with its adjacent nodes. Considering the pyramid
structure depicted in Fig. 11, let n(s) RD denote the lth node in the sth layer of the pyra-
mid graph. The node n(s) can obtai l n t ∈ he set N (s) of its neighboring nodes in adjacent layers.

This set encompasses three components: (1) neighboring A nodes within the same layer,
including the n(s) node itself, denoted as A (s); (2) the lower layer nodes, representing finer

time scale nodes, denoted as C (s); and (3) the upper layer nodes, representing the coarser
l
time scale node, denoted as P (s). This set is expressed as follows:

where L is the sequence length of the original input to the model, while A denotes a
hyperparameter indicating the number of nodes selected at the same time scale. C serves as
another hyperparameter designed to regulate the number of ensemble nodes. To ensure the
model focuses on multi-scale time-series information, PAM lets nodes n(s) compute atten-
l
tion correlations within the set N (s):

(cid:28) (cid:30) (cid:29)
where q is the query vector generated by node n( l s), and k i , v i are key-value pairs gener-
ated by nodes in the set N (s). Pyraformer aggregates time steps of fine time scales into coarse
l
time scales through convolutional operations and captures similarity correlations across dif-
ferent time scales using the Attention mechanism.Unlike Pyraformer, Triformer (Cirstea
et al. 2022) generates coarse time-scale time steps through the Attention mechanism and
takes fine time-scale sequences as inputs when processing coarse time-scale sequences. As
shown in Fig. 12, the Triformer consists of multiple processing layers stacked on top of each
other, each of which corresponds to a different time scale. The results from the fine time-
scale processing in the lower layers are fed as inputs to the coarser time-scale processing
layers. The outputs from all layers are integrated into Triformer’s prediction process. This
mechanism enables Triformer to effectively explore multi-scale time series information.
Next, we will delve into the underlying principles of each processing layer in Triformer. Tri-
former initially divides the input sequence into multiple local short sequences and applies
the Attention mechanism within these segments. For a local short sequence XXX p RD × p in
∈
this layer, where p represents the length of the local short sequence. The output of the Atten-
tion mechanism in Triformer can be expressed as:
ooo p =Atten(hhh,XXX p ,XXX p ), (24)
where ooo
p
RD is the temporal feature vector at a short-term interval, corresponding to the
∈
coarser time scale. Meanwhile, hhh RD serves as the query vector, capturing the temporal
∈
information at the current scale. So hhh necessitates re-initialization for each processing layer
accommodating distinct time scales. It is worth noting that ooo p will be used as the time step
in the input sequence of the next processing layer.
Non-stationary Information: Non-stationary information refers to variations in the sta-
tistical characteristics of a time series over time (Ulyanov et al. 2016; Du et al. 2021; Muan-
det et al. 2013; Zhong and Cambria 2023). The presence of non-stationary time series poses
challenges for prediction tasks in deep learning models, as they complicate the modeling
of sequences of statistically changing data during inference, typically manifested through
shifts in mean and standard deviation. RevIN (Kim et al. 2021) addresses this issue by stan-
dardizing input sequences within the model, ensuring each processed sequence adheres to
a consistent distribution, and subsequently reverting the model’s predicted sequences to the
original distribution during the output stage. Hereafter, we delve into a detailed exposition
of RevIN.
RevIN is a flexible end-to-end method that can be applied to arbitrary models (Li et
al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024, 2022). To mitigate non-stationary effects in input time series, it
1 3

initially normalizes each sequence within a defined lookback window. Unlike conventional
normalization techniques applied during time series preprocessing, RevIN normalizes input
sequences within the lookback window utilizing learnable affine parameters. The normal-
ized sequences are then fed into the forecasting model to generate predictions. During the
output stage, RevIN reverses the normalization process to restore the non-stationary char-
acteristics of the time series. Formally, for an input time series XXX, RevIN’s processing can
be represented as:
|     |      | L        |       | L        |      |             |       |           |      |

Non-stationary information within time series poses a significant challenge to accurate fore-
casting, it is widely acknowledged that preprocessing methods such as those discussed in
(Kim et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2022; Passalis et al. 2019) can help mitigate the non-station-
ary nature of the original input series. However, removing the inherent non-stationarity
of sequences may lead to the problem of over-stationarization, which in turn can subject
forecasting models to severe overfitting. To tackle this issue, NS-Transformer (Liu et al.
2022) integrates non-stationary information into the Attention mechanism, compensating
for information lost during the normalization of the sequence.NS-Transformer adopts the
standard Transformer architecture but incorporates De-stationary Attention in place of con-
ventional Attention mechanisms. De-stationary Attention leverages statistical information,
specifically mean and variance derived from instance normalization, enhancing the model’s
ability to capture non-stationary patterns within the original time series. Since NS-Trans-
former assumes that the time series have the same variance in all variables, vvv is simplified
to the scalar v. Given the stationarized input sequence XXXˆ , linear mappings yield QQQˆ , KKKˆ ,
VVVˆ, alongside statistical parameters mmm and v from the original sequence. The computation
process of De-stationary Attention is as follows:
AAAˆ
|     |     | AAAˆ | =vQQQˆ (cid:31)KKKˆ |                | OOOˆ | =VVVˆ    |     |     |      |

where QQQ,KKK,VVV are the query matrix, key matrix, and value matrix obtained by linear map-
ping of the original input sequence. mmm denotes the mean vector statistically obtained in
the normalization, and v denotes the variance statistically obtained in the normalization.In
order to directly use deep learning implementation Equation(27), NS-Transformer uses a

For the prediction of the Transformer model, NS-Transformer similarly chooses to denor-

3.2 Mining correlations among variables
In the context of multivariate time series forecasting, each time series dimension represents
a distinct univariate time series. In addition to considering time-step dependencies, correla-
tions among variables also play a crucial role in predicting multivariate time series (Cheng
et al. 2022; Jin et al. 2022; Cao et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2023). For example, when predicting
future temperature for a given region, relying solely on historical temperature records from
the region is insufficient. Instead, including historical wind speed data from the region and
historical temperature data from neighboring regions can significantly enhance the accu-
racy of the prediction. Therefore, in addition to capturing time-step dependencies, an alter-
native approach to temporal processing is to capture the correlations among variables. In
section 3.1, the previously discussed forecasting models mainly concentrate on exploring
dependencies among time steps, often overlooking the exploration of correlations among
variables. Particularly, PatchTST (Nie et al. 2022), a model incorporating the Channel Inde-
pendence (CI) strategy, entirely disregards correlations among variables. In the following,
we will introduce models that explicitly extract correlations among variables.
To address variables at a more detailed level, TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformers) (Lim
et al. 2021) classifies the variables of the input time series into three categories:
1. Static variables: variables remain constant over time.
2. Time-dependent variables: variables exhibit temporal changes and require prediction.
3. Future-known variables: These variables include known future information (e.g.,
upcoming holiday dates), other exogenous time series (e.g., historical customer foot
traffic), and static metadata (e.g., store location).To handle these categorized multiple
variables, TFT incorporates a Variable Selection Network (VSN) module for filtering.
The structure of VSN is schematically represented in Fig. 13. For different types of
input variables, the VSN guides them individually through the Gated Residual Network
(GRN) module. Furthermore, the VSN plays a crucial role in regulating the representa-
tion for each variable by utilizing weighted averaging, serving as an effective mecha-
nism for variable filtering. Specifically, the formulations of GRN are given by:
eee=ELU(WWW x xxx+WWW c ccc+bbb e ), (29)
ddd=WWW d eee+bbb d , (30)
GRN(xxx,ccc)=LayerNorm(xxx+GLU(ddd)), (31)
where xxx RL and ccc RL are univariate time series respectively from the primary input

activation function.In TFT, the VSN module assigns weights to different variables, which
helps suppress certain variables’ representation and remove noisy inputs. The VSN only
accepts an univariate sequence as input, thus its output weights cannot consider the correla-
tion between different variables. To address this issue, Aliformer (Qi et al. 2021) leverages
the Attention mechanism to capture the similarity relationships among variables, which is
called AliAttention. This innovative approach enables the fusion of attention graphs gener-
ated from different variables, allowing the Attention mechanism to consider the similarity
relations among diverse variables simultaneously.

graph that integrates the similarity matrices of different variables. By incorporating AliAt-
tention, the Attention mechanism can explore the interdependencies among the variables by
fusing the attention graphs.To facilitate a comprehensive exploration of correlations among
variables, Crossformer (Zhang and Yan 2022) introduces the concept of directly applying
the Attention mechanism to the variables instead of fusing attention graphs. For this pur-
pose, Crossformer proposes DAttention. For the input time series XXX RD L, Crossformer

first transposes the dimension of input series to obtain transposed XXX(cid:31) ∈ RL D, and then

feeds XXX(cid:31) into the Attention mechanism. DAttention, based on Equation (4) and (5), can be
mathematically expressed as:

in how they utilize the Attention mechanism. AliAttention focuses on capturing similar rela-

tionships of variables by fusing attention graphs derived from each variable. On the other
hand, DAttention applies the Attention mechanism directly to the variables, allowing it to
uncover the cross-time-step dependence of variables.
4 Long-term time series forecasting optimization
In the field of long-term time series forecasting, Transformer model (Wu et al. 2021; Zhou
et al. 2021, 2022) is widely used. This is because Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
have limitations regarding their receptive field, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
suffer from issues like error accumulation and gradient explosion. However, the attention
mechanism’s computational cost grows quadratically with the series length. To address
these challenges, researchers have developed various methods to optimize the attention
mechanism for long-term time series prediction, as shown in Table 2.
The computational cost of the attention mechanism mainly arises from computing the
similarity relationships between time steps. To optimize the Attention mechanism, two main
approaches have been proposed:
(1) Shortening the length of the input sequence of the Attention mechanism: This approach
aims to reduce the computational complexity by processing shorter subsequences
instead of the entire input sequence. Various techniques, such as window-based (Zhou
et al. 2021; Cirstea et al. 2022), segment-based (Nie et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2021), and
hierarchical methods (Zhang and Yan 2022), have been proposed to divide the input
sequence into smaller parts before applying the attention mechanism.
(2) Sparsifying the attention mechanism: This approach selectively computes and sparsifies
the similarity relationships, reducing the required computations. Different methods like
sparse Attention (Li et al. 2019), kernelized Attention (Kitaev et al. 2020), and low-rank
Attention (Zhou et al. 2021) have been developed to exploit the sparsity or low-rank
structure in the similarity matrix, resulting in computational savings.In the following
sections, we will explore these two approaches as a guiding framework to introduce
optimization methods for the Attention mechanism in long-term time series prediction.
Shorten the Length of Time Series Processed by Attention Mechanism: Informer (Zhou et
al. 2021) utilizes the Transformer framework, which integrates convolution and pooling
operations to shorten the length of time series gradually. This sequential aggregation of
time steps occurs at each layer. As a result, the computational burden of the Transformer is
significantly diminished. Therefore, the input time series of the jth layer in Informer can be
expressed as follows:
XXXˆ j =MaxPool ELU(Conv1d(XXXˆ j 1 )) , (35)
−
(cid:31) (cid:30)
where XXXˆ j RD × Lj represents the output time series of the jth layer, and L j denotes its
s th e a q t u L en j c < e l L e ∈ n j gt 1 h . . U T n h li e k e in I p n u fo t r o m f e t r h , e P j a t t h c h la T y S e T r, ( d N e i n e o e te t d a l a . s 2 0 XXXˆ 22 j − ) 1 ta ∈ ke R s D a × d L i j ff − e 1, r e i n s t w ap o p rt r h o a n c o h t i b n y g
−
dividing the original input sequence into multiple fixed-length short sequences, as depicted
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 27 of 67 23
in Fig. 5. This decision allows the model to transition from processing a single, lengthy
sequence to managing multiple, short sequences. Additionally, PatchTST treats these short
sequences as cohesive units and employs its attention mechanism to compute their similar-
ity relationships. As a result, the space complexity of the attention mechanism in PatchTST
is reduced from the original O(L2) to O(N2), where L represents the length of the input
sequence and N denotes the number of units, with N L. Consequently, PatchTST
(cid:31)
achieves significant reductions in space complexity. Other models, such as Pyraformer (Liu
et al. 2021) and Triformer (Cirstea et al. 2022), employ a similar strategy to PatchTST
in optimizing the space complexity of the attention mechanism. Compared to Informer,
PatchTST demonstrates a greater advantage in optimizing space complexity due to its treat-
ment of sliced short sequences during processing. Notably, this advantage becomes more
pronounced when handling long-term time series, as the growth rate of N remains relatively
slow compared to the progressive increase of L.
Sparse the Attention Mechanism: Sparsing the attention mechanism involves selectively
computing the similarity between time steps within the mechanism while preserving the origi-
nal length of the input sequence. These approaches can also effectively address the space com-
plexity associated with the attention mechanism. Building upon this concept, LogTrans (Li et
al. 2019) introduces the LogSparse Self-Attention mechanism. Illustrated in Fig. 15, for the tth
time step of the input time sequence, LogSparse Self-Attention determines the index of the time
step with which the similarity relationship needs to be computed as follows:
III t = t 2 (cid:30) log2t (cid:29) ,t 2 (cid:30) log2t − 1 (cid:29) ,t 2 (cid:30) log2t − 2 (cid:29) , ,t 20,t , (36)
− − − ··· −
(cid:31) (cid:30)
where III represents the index of the time step in the tth time step where similarity computation
t
is required. LogSparse Self-Attention selectively filters similarity relationships based on their
temporal proximity to the current time step, prioritizing relationships among nearby time steps.
Additionally, LogSparse Self-Attention is causal, meaning that the current time step disregards
similar information from future time steps.Unlike LogTrans, which utilizes distance between
time steps as a filtering criterion, Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020) aims to group time steps in the
feature space and compute attention within the groups, thereby achieving sparsity in the atten-
tion mechanism. The challenge of rapidly finding nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces
can be addressed by Locality-Sensitive Hashing(LSH). A hashing scheme that assigns each
time step to a hash space is called locality-sensitive if nearby vectors get the same hash with
high probability and distant ones do not. Based on the LSH, Reformer proposes the LSH Atten-
tion mechanism. LSH Attention maps the input time series into a hash space, allowing attention
computations only between time steps close to each other within this space.
To map time steps into the hash space, Reformer establishes the hash function as fol-
lows: h(xxx)=argmax RRR (cid:31) xxx, − RRR (cid:31) xxx , where RRR ∈ RD × b/2, and b represents the number
of hashes, which corresponds to the dimension of the hash space. As depicted in Fig. 16, the
(cid:31)(cid:30) (cid:29)(cid:28)
time steps within the input time series are mapped to the hash space using this hash function.
Based on the positional relationship of the time steps in the hash space, Reformer organizes
all time steps into distinct groups. Within each group, each time step computes the similarity
relationship exclusively with other time steps belonging to the same group. This selective
calculation significantly reduces the computation cost of the attention mechanism.

Informer (Zhou et al. 2021) also incorporates sparsity within its attention mechanism.
However, unlike LogTrans and Reformer, Informer adopts a unique filtering criterion for
similarity relationships based on the following assumption: within the attention mechanism,
if the query vector qqq possesses intricate temporal information, its attention distribution with
respect to all key vectors should deviate significantly from a uniform distribution. Based on
this concept, Informer introduces ProbSparse Self-Attention, which selectively retains the
computation results of the query according to the score of each query. The scoring function
for query vector qqq can be expressed as follows:
|     |               | L qqqkkk  | L                  |      |

larity distribution relative to the other key vectors kkk. Ultimately, ProbSparse Self-Attention
selectively retains the Top-U query vectors.LogTrans, Reformer, and Informer employ
Sparse Attention mechanisms that rely on specific filtering criteria for computing similarity
relationships. For example, LogTrans filters the target of attention computation based on the
distance between time steps. Reformer maps the data into a hash space and filters the target
of attention computation based on the distance among time steps in the hash space. Informer
filters query vectors based on the distribution of similarities between the query vector and
all key vectors. In contrast, Crossformer (Zhang and Yan 2022) adopts a different approach
by not employing a specific filtering criterion to sparsify the attention mechanism. Instead, it
introduces transition units to avoid direct similarity computations between time steps. This
strategy effectively reduces the space complexity of the Attention mechanism.
In the Crossformer model, when processing the input time serok with a length of L using
the attention mechanism, c transition units are introduced, where c L. These transition
(cid:31)
units act as intermediate components for performing similarity computations between query
vectors and key vectors within the attention mechanism. This approach helps avoid the
space complexity of O(L2) associated with direct similarity computations between query

allows for a reduction in the space complexity of the attention mechanism from O(L2) to a

5 Loss function
According to the optimization objective, the loss function commonly used in time series
prediction models can be classified into two main types:
(1) Loss function with a single optimization objective. This type of loss function primarily
focuses on optimizing the gap in value between the prediction and the ground truth.
The simplicity of this category of loss functions makes it widely employed. However, it
has the limitation of solely aiming to minimize the gap in value between the prediction
and the ground truth. Consequently, this category of loss functions faces challenges
when dealing with time series that contain intricate temporal patterns and exhibit strong
fluctuations.
(2) Hybrid loss function that optimizes the multiple objectives. To address the aforemen-
tioned issue, an alternative group of models utilizes hybrid loss functions that optimize
the multiple objectives. This category of loss functions aims to combine multiple loss
functions to optimize different modules of the model, enabling collaborative predictions.
In the following sections, we will discuss these two types of loss functions separately.
5.1 Single-objective loss function
MAE, MSE: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) are commonly
utilized loss functions in time series prediction tasks. They are employed to optimize the gap
in value between the predicted values and the ground truth. MAE calculates the average of
the absolute value of the prediction errors, while MSE calculates the average of the squared
prediction errors. The specific formulas are provided below:
O D
1 1
MAE(YYY,YYYˆˆˆ)= O ×D | y i,j − yˆ i,j | , (41)
(cid:31)

(cid:31)

MSE(YYY,YYYˆˆˆ)= O ×D (y i,j − yˆ i,j )2, (42)
(cid:31)
i=1
(cid:31)
j=1
where YYY

RO
×
D represents the ground truth, YYYˆˆˆ

RO

D represents the prediction, and
O is the length of the prediction and D is the number of variables. From this equation, it
becomes evident that when dealing with challenging-to-predict data points, MSE exacer-
bates the gap in value between the prediction and the ground truth, imposing a more sub-
stantial penalty. On the other hand, MAE lacks this characteristic and treats all prediction
points uniformly. In time series forecasting tasks, using MAE as the loss function can effec-
tively mitigate the impact of outliers during model training. This approach is particularly
beneficial for datasets like electricity and wind power data. Conversely, when the chal-
1 3

lenging prediction points in the time series dataset containning significant information, as
observed in Traffic datasets (Wu et al. 2021) and Exchange Rate datasets (Lai et al. 2018),
the model can opt for MSE as the loss function to emphasize their importance during the
training process.In essence, employing MSE or MAE implies a disregard for the direction
of the error (Wang and Bovik 2009), meaning we are indifferent to whether the prediction
surpasses or falls short of the actual value. However, this characteristic becomes crucial in
specific time prediction scenarios. For instance, when forecasting the remaining lifespan of
an engine, our prediction must underestimate the true value to prevent potential accidents.
Quantile Loss: Quantile loss is commonly used as a loss function in time series predic-
tion tasks. Unlike MSE and MAE, quantile loss penalizes positive and negative deviations
between predicted and true values differently. Given the prediction YYYˆˆˆ and the ground truth
YYY, the quantile loss between them can be expressed as:
=q max(0,YYY YYYˆˆˆ)+(1 q) max(0,YYYˆˆˆ YYY), (43)
L ∗ − − ∗ −
where the quantile coefficient q [0,1] can be adjusted to meet the specific demands of
∈
the prediction task. For example, in aircraft remaining useful life prediction (Zhang et al.
2023, 2023; Wang et al. 2023), it is often desired for the model’s predictions to be lower
than the actual lifespan of the aircraft to minimize potential risks. Therefore, a quantile
coefficient q <0.5 can be used, which increases the penalty imposed by the loss function
on larger predictions. This setting encourages the model to generate smaller predictions.
However, a drawback of quantile loss is the requirement to specify a target quantile, which
is often impractical in many prediction scenarios.In summary, MAE, MSE, and quantile
loss are commonly used loss functions for point forecasts in deep learning models for time
series prediction. These loss functions are effective for both univariate and multivariate
predictions, as well as for single-step and multi-step forecasting. Among the three, MSE is
suitable when prediction errors are expected to follow a Gaussian distribution. However,
when a dataset contains numerous outliers, MSE can be heavily affected by these, poten-
tially leading to model failure. In such cases, MAE might be a better choice as the loss
function. In specific scenarios, such as Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction (Zhang et
al. 2023, 2023; Wang et al. 2023), where biased predictions are necessary, quantile loss is
often employed.
Beyond point forecasts, interval forecasts (Armstrong 2001) represent another approach
in time series prediction. As the name suggests, this method provides a range of possible
outcomes rather than a single point, offering insights into the model’s confidence or predic-
tion uncertainty. For interval forecasts, deep learning models typically use quantile loss as
the loss function. Unlike in point forecasts, when quantile loss is applied to interval fore-
casts, the quantile parameter q in (43) represents a range rather than a single value. Due to
space limitations, this paper does not explore interval forecasting in detail.
5.2 Hybrid loss function
The shortcomings of the aforementioned loss functions lie in their optimization objectives,
which solely focus on the numerical distance between predictions and ground truth. Addi-
tionally, models based on a single optimization target are often structurally simple and can-
not incorporate other structured predictive mechanisms such as SSM (State Space Model)
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 31 of 67 23
(Salinas et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2021) or GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) (Wu et al.
2020; Mogren 2016; Goodfellow et al. 2014). Therefore, in order to leverage these special-
ized structures for collaborative predictions, some models utilize a joint loss function to
optimize multiple objectives introduced by different structures within the model.
Negative Log-likelihood: SSDNet (Lin et al. 2021) incorporates MAE alongside the
negative log-likelihood as its loss function. This loss function allows for the simultaneous
consideration of the numerical gap and distributions between the prediction and the ground
truth. By tuning a parameter, SSDNet balances the influences of the MAE and the negative
log-likelihood. The SSDNet model comprises the Transformer and the SSM (State Space
Model) network. The SSM network is a mathematical framework that describes the relation-
ship between latent states and observable data in a time series.
SSMs (Durbin and Koopman 2012; Hyndman 2008; Seeger et al. 2016) enable the incor-
poration of structural assumptions into the model, making them particularly well-suited for
scenarios where the time series structure is well-understood. This approach enhances the
model’s interpretability and promotes efficient data utilization during the learning process.
However, traditional SSMs are limited in their ability to infer shared patterns from a dataset
of similar time series, as they are fitted individually to each time series.
SSDNet utilizes the Transformer to learn and estimate the parameters of the SSM net-
work, enabling the generation of interpretable predictions through the SSM network. There-
fore, SSDNet requires optimization of the SSM network’s predictions and parameters.
SSDNet employs a hybrid loss function that integrates MAE and negative log-likelihood.
This approach serves the dual purpose of optimizing the model’s prediction through MAE
and refining the parameters of the SSM network via negative log-likelihood.
The negative log-likelihood loss function requires the model’s output to represent the
parameters of a probability distribution. The objective of this loss function is to maximize
the probability of a real sample satisfying the predicted distribution. Therefore, for a real
sample Y=[y , ,y ], and the parameters θθθ representing the predicted probability dis-
1 ··· O
tribution by the model, the optimization objective of the negative log-likelihood can be
formulated as follows:
O
θθθ ∗ =argmin logP(yyy i θθθ). (44)

(cid:31)
Generating Adversarial Loss Functions: Inspired by the training method of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2020; Mogren 2016),
some models aim to utilize adversarial training to sequences generated by the generator
should closely resemble real sequences and remain indistinguishable by the discriminator.
Therefore, its optimization objective can be represented as:

denotes the data samples drawn from the true distribution, and z p z (z) denotes the fake

data samples generated by the generator. From Equation (45), it is evident that the optimiza-
tion goal is twofold: the discriminator aims to distinguish between sequences generated

by the generator and real sequences, while the generator strives to produce fake sequences
that the discriminator cannot differentiate from real ones. Next, we will use the AST (Wu et
al. 2020) model as an example to introduce the loss function of the generative adversarial
approach.AST introduces the integration of the GAN training method into time series pre-
diction tasks. It utilizes the Transformer model as a generator, referred to as G, to generate
predictions. The predictions and the real samples are then fed into a discriminator, denoted
as  , for discrimination. The discriminator consists of multiple fully connected layers,
D
forming a fully connected network. The GAN loss function consists of two main compo-
nents: the discriminator loss and the generator loss. In AST, the generator loss is derived
from the quantile loss function P (), quantifying the numerical gap between the prediction
ρ
·
and the real sample. Conversely, the discriminator loss is based on the log-likelihood loss,
which evaluates the ability of the discriminator to distinguish the fake and real samples.

6  Experiments
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the afore-
mentioned methods on various real-world time series prediction scenarios.
6.1  Dataset
As shown in Table 3, our empirical results are based on datasets from diverse domains, such
as energy, exchange rate, traffic, and disease. Detailed descriptions of these datasets are
provided below:
(1)  Energy: The ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset (Zhou et al. 2021) con-
sists of data collected from power transformers in a specific region of China, spanning
from July 2016 to July 2018. It includes seven distinct features, such as the load and
oil temperature of the power transformers. The ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets encompass
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 33 of 67 23
17,420 samples with a sampling interval of 1 h, covering 7 features. On the other hand,
the ETTm1 and ETTm2 datasets comprise 69,680 samples with a sampling interval of
5 min, also encompassing 7 features. The Electricity dataset (Wu et al. 2021) contains
hourly electricity consumption data from 321 customers from 2012 to 2014. It con-
sists of 321 features and a total of 26,304 samples. Due to the temporal characteristics
of electricity, electricity datasets naturally exhibit strong periodicity. For instance, the
electricity data shows evident monthly periodicity due to the influence of temperature
during the summer and winter seasons. Additionally, the electricity dataset also exhibits
pronounced daily periodicity across different time periods within a day.
(2) Exchange Rates: The Exchange dataset (Lai et al. 2018) covers daily exchange rates
for eight currencies from January 1990 to October 2010. It contains eight features and
a total of 7,588 samples. Unlike other time series data, the exchange rate data does not
exhibit significant periodicity patterns, and its fluctuation changes are more complex.
Additionally, important time series information is often contained in the extreme points
of the exchange rate data, making methods like smoothing potentially result in the loss
of important information.
(3) Traffic: The Traffic dataset (Wu et al. 2021) comprises hourly data from the Califor-
nia Department of Transportation for the years 2015-2016. It captures road occupancy,
measured by various San Francisco Bay Area freeway sensors. The dataset includes
862 features and a total of 17,544 samples. Unlike electricity datasets, traffic datasets
exhibit evident short-term periodic patterns. Moreover, traffic accidents frequently lead
to abnormal occupancy rates on the associated roadways, resulting in a higher incidence
of outliers in the traffic dataset, which can impact model performance.
(4) Illness: The ILI (Influenza-Like Illness) dataset (Wu et al. 2021) comprises weekly
records of patients diagnosed with influenza illness, as reported by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, spanning from 2002 to 2021. This dataset includes 7
features, such as the proportion of patients with ILI and the total number of patients. It
follows a sampling interval of 1 week and 966 samples. Due to the dynamics of disease
transmission, the illness datasets exhibit fluctuations characterized by prominent long-
term yearly and monthly periodic patterns and noteworthy short-term trends.
6.2 Model
Table 4 summarizes all the models that appear in the experimental section. For the above
models, we have referred to the optimal parameter settings in their respective papers and
source code, and we have applied these parameter settings in the following experiments.
6.3 Evaluation metric
The time series forecasting task is typically categorized as a regression problem. Conse-
quently, evaluation metrics commonly used in regression tasks are employed to assess the
forecasting performance of models in the time series forecasting task. Based on previous
studies (Wu et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2022; Li et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021), we utilize the
mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) as fundamental metrics to evalu-
ate the performance of models. At the same time, to facilitate a more intuitive comparison
1 3

| 23  Page 34 of 67 |     |     |     |     | X. Song et al. |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------------- |
of the prediction outcomes across various models, we integrated two supplementary evalu-
ation metrics, MAPE, and R2, in addition to MAE and MSE. MAPE measures the relative
error between predicted and actual values, ranging from 0 to positive infinity; the closer to 0,
the more accurate the predictions. R2 evaluates how well the independent variables explain
the dependent variable, with values from 0 to 1; the closer to 1, the better the model fits the
data. Nonetheless, we presented Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) and R2 solely
in specific experiments due to space constraints. The definitions of all metrics are given by

the model. Here, N signifies the number of elements within the set, indicating the presence
of N instances. Each instance is characterized by two elements within the set with dimen-
sions of RO D. The parameter (cid:31) is a small value close to 0, introduced to prevent division
×
by zero scenarios. In our code implementation, we have uniformly set (cid:31) to 0.005 across
different models to handle such cases effectively.
6.4  Main results
In this section, we perform experimental analyses on the models and methods mentioned
earlier, considering various perspectives:
1.  Comprehensive Prediction Accuracy Assessment: We will assess the prediction accu-
racy of all the mentioned models on 5 time series datasets derived from 4 distinct
domains. This assessment aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models’
performances.
2.  Investigation of Limitations: Considering the limitations of current complex models,
we will investigate the underlying causes by focusing on two aspects.
(1) Shuffling Analysis: By shuffling the input time series, we can analyze the model’s
ability to capture the sequential order of the data. This analysis involves comparing
the model’s prediction accuracy before and after shuffling.
(2) Extending the Lookback Window Analysis: Another aspect involves extending the
length of the input time series while maintaining a consistent prediction length.

Attention modules utilized in the models. To achieve this, a comparative experiment
has been designed to evaluate the prediction accuracy and complexity associated with
various Attention modules.These analyses aim to gain insights into the strengths, limi-
tations, performances, and characteristics of the models and methods mentioned earlier.
6.4.1  Evaluation of model prediction accuracy
In order to comprehensively evaluate the prediction accuracy of each model, this section
presents experimental results on both multivariate and univariate time series prediction
tasks.
As shown in Fig. 17, We employ two different validation set splitting methods: (1) simple
time split validation and (2) sliding window validation. In simple time split validation (Wu
et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2021; Kitaev et al. 2020; Li et al. 2019), the training, validation,
and test sets are sequentially divided based on time. Sliding window validation (Liu and

Yang 2022; Malenica et al. 2021; Mintarsih et al. 2023), on the other hand, uses a fixed-size
window that continuously slides over time for training and validation. Compared to simple
time split validation, sliding window validation traverses the entire time series, altering the
training and validation sets as it progresses. This method is particularly suited for slightly
stationary or concept-drifting time series, especially in financial datasets.
We initially apply simple time split validation to all datasets to assess the predictive accu-
racy of the models. Unless otherwise specified, the batch size for all experiments was set to
16. To ensure robustness and reliability, all experimental results presented in this study are
averaged over five trials. Consistent with previous work (Wu et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2022;
Woo et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2021), we fixed the input length of the ILI dataset at L=36 and
set the output length O to 12, 24, 48 for short-term, regular-term, and long-term time series
predictions, respectively. For the remaining datasets, we fixed the input length at L=96
and set the output length O to 48, 96, 336 for short-term, regular-term, and long-term pre-
dictions, respectively. All hyperparameters for the deep learning models in the experiments
were set according to the optimal configurations provided in their respective papers or code.
For univariate time series prediction, we used the traditional ARIMA model as the baseline,
while for multivariate time series prediction, we employed the VAR (Vector Autoregressive)
model as the baseline.
The complete experimental results of the multivariate time series prediction task can be
found in Table 13 in Appendix A. From the table, it is observed that among all the mentioned
models, models utilizing the method of time series decomposition (e.g., Fedformer, ETS-
former) and Transformer-based approaches (e.g., Crossformer, PatchTST) exhibit signifi-
cantly superior prediction accuracy compared to the remaining models. Therefore, in Table
5, we only present the experimental results of these two types of methods. It is worth noting
that, to further evaluate the performance of these methods on slightly stationary time series,
in Table 5, we applied sliding window validation with a window size set to one-tenth of the
dataset length for the financial exchange dataset.
In the multivariate time-series forecasting experiment, we observe several noteworthy
findings. DLinear (Yun et al. 2019), which directly extracts temporal features using linear
layers. demonstrates commendable prediction accuracy across the vast majority of datas-
ets. Specifically, in Table 5, we observe that DLinear outperforms the suboptimal model
PatchTST in terms of MAE and Fedformer in terms of MAPE for the ETTh1 dataset. It
achieves improvements of 3.13% and 2.24% for prediction length of 336, respectively. Fur-
thermore, it is worth noting that DLinear also boosted performance by 14.87% on R2 for
prediction lengths of 336 compared with the suboptimal model PatchTST. On the other
hand, Crossformer (Zhang and Yan 2022) primarily focuses on capturing the correlation
among time-series variables, making it particularly effective for datasets characterized by
intricate variables. For instance, in the Electricity dataset, which comprises 321 variables,
surpassing other datasets in terms of the number of variables, Crossformer exhibits a dis-
tinct accuracy advantage over the suboptimal model NS-Transformer. It achieves improve-
ments of 10.93% and 17.70% in MSE and MAPE for prediction lengths of 48, respectively.
However, it is worth noting that Crossformer’s computational cost is considerably high,
which may limit its feasibility for long-term time series prediction tasks due to resource
constraints.
PatchTST (Nie et al. 2022), on the other hand, demonstrates enhanced suitability for
datasets characterized by pronounced long-term periodicity and trends, such as exchange
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 49 of 67 23
rate and illness datasets. By dividing the input time series into fixed-length patches and
emphasizing time-step dependencies between the patches, PatchTST is capable of uncov-
ering long-term temporal relationships and achieves notable improvements in MSE and
R2 compared to other models. For example, in Table 5, PatchTST shows improvements
of 27.30% and 17.49% in MSE and R2, respectively, for a prediction length of 48 on the
ILI dataset compared to the suboptimal model NS-Transformer. Similarly, on the Traffic
dataset, PatchTST exhibits significant accuracy advantages over the suboptimal model NS-
Transformer, achieving improvements of 11.46% in MAE for a prediction length of 336.
The complete results of the univariate time series prediction experiment can be found in
Table 14 in Appendix A. The findings in Table 14, consistent with those in the multivariate
time series forecasting experiment, indicate that models based on time-series decomposition
methods and Transformer-based models exhibit superior prediction accuracy for univariate
time series forecasting compared to other models. Therefore, in Table 6, we present the
results of these two categories separately. Similarly, in Table 6, we applied sliding win-
dow validation with a window size set to one-tenth of the dataset length for the financial
exchange dataset.
In the univariate time series prediction task, both NS-Transformer (Liu et al. 2022) and
DLinear model demonstrate superior performance across various datasets. For instance, in
the long-term prediction task on the ILI dataset, NS-Transformer outperforms the subopti-
mal model PatchTST with improvements of 9.54%, 25.32%, 46.47% in MAE, MSE and R2
, respectively. Comparing the results of multivariate and univariate time series prediction
experiments, it is evident that NS-Transformer exhibits inferior performance in multivariate
scenarios while demonstrating better performance in univariate scenarios. The main rea-
son is that NS-Transformer incorporates non-stationary information from variables into the
attention mechanism and adjusts the output of the attention mechanism based on the non-
stationary information. However, in multivariate prediction tasks, an excessive amount of
non-stationary information negatively impacts the output results of the attention mechanism.
Upon analyzing the empirical results of both multivariate and univariate time series pre-
diction, we observe that DLinear consistently demonstrates superior accuracy compared
to the majority of models. Interestingly, despite using a simpler linear layer for capturing
time-step dependencies, DLinear outperforms numerous sophisticated models. This finding
suggests that existing complex models may have limited capability in effectively capturing
and utilizing time-step information, potentially leading to overfitting and noise interference.
Additionally, compared to other models, DLinear makes more effective use of the sequential
order of the input data, which is likely a key factor in its success.
6.4.2 Evaluation of information mining capabilities for complex models
Based on the analysis of results from both multivariate and univariate time series forecast-
ing experiments, we argue that current complex models are prone to issues such as overfit-
ting and still demonstrate deficiencies in capturing essential time-step dependencies. As a
result, in this section, we will conduct an input shuffling experiment and extend the look-
back window experiment to explore further and clarify the limitations of complex models.
Input Shuffling Experiment: In time series forecasting, the sequential order of time series
often carries significant sequential information. A reliable model should be able to effec-
1 3

23 Page 50 of 67 X. Song et al.
tively capture and understand the sequential order information. As a result, different sequen-
tial orders of input time series should lead to distinct predictions.
To evaluate the model’s ability to capture sequential order information across time steps,
we shuffle the input time series of the model. By comparing the model’s prediction accuracy
before and after shuffling, we can analyze the model’s capacity to capture the sequential
information of the time series.
The input length for the ILI dataset was set to L=36, and the prediction length O
was set to 24. Furthermore, for the other datasets, the input length was set to L=96, and
the prediction length was set to O =96. All empirical results presented in this study were
obtained by averaging the outputs of five randomized experiments. The prediction accuracy
of the model is positively correlated with its capability to extract sequential information.
Based on the analysis in Sect. 6.4.1, it is evident that DLinear and PatchTST exhibit sig-
nificant accuracy advantages over various existing complex models (such as Autoformer,
TDformer, ETSformer, etc.) across all datasets despite maintaining a simpler model struc-
ture. Table 7 shows that PatchTST exhibits the most notable decline in prediction accuracy
after shuffling the input sequence across the ETTh1, ILI, and Exchange datasets. Similarly,
DLinear also experiences a substantial decline in model accuracy following order shuffling
in these datasets. On the other hand, complex models like Autoformer, TDformer, and others
demonstrate minimal impact on their prediction accuracy or even show slight improvements
after input shuffling. For instance, TDformer demonstrates a remarkable 33.87% improve-
ment in MSE on the Exchange dataset after shuffling, whereas LSTnet exhibits a 4.83%
enhancement in MSE on the ILI dataset after shuffling.
Based on the experimental results and the preceding analysis, we can conclude a posi-
tive correlation between the prediction accuracy of a model and its ability to capture the
sequential order of the time series. Moreover, the existing complex models exhibit limited
proficiency in effectively capturing the sequential order of the time series, which explains
their comparatively lower prediction accuracy when compared to simpler models in both
multivariate and univariate time series forecasting experiments. Apart from their weaker
capability to capture the time series sequential information, we also suggest that the com-
plex models face challenges such as overfitting and noise interference. Therefore, our sub-
sequent experiment investigates whether these issues affect these models.
Extending the Lookback Window Experiment: To investigate the potential overfitting and
noise interference of complex models in time series prediction, we conduct extending look-
back window experiments. The size of the lookback window significantly influences the
accuracy of time series prediction, as it determines the amount of historical information
incorporated by the model. Generally, superior models achieve more accurate predictions
using an extended lookback window. However, in the case of models affected by overfitting
and noise interference, an extended lookback window introduces more noise. Due to over-
fitting, the model cannot effectively incorporate additional historical information, resulting
in decreased prediction accuracy with an extended lookback window. Building on this con-
cept, this section presents the extending lookback window experiment.
In our experiment, we set input time series lengths to 48, 96, 192 while keeping the
output prediction length fixed at 96 for the time series. We then examine the changes in
prediction accuracy for each model as the lookback window is extended. It is important
to note that all results presented in this study are obtained by averaging the outputs of five
randomized experiments.
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 51 of 67 23
The experimental results are depicted in Table 8. Complex models, including ETSformer,
TDformer, and Autoformer, achieve their highest prediction accuracies only with the short-
est input time series. In contrast, their accuracies gradually decline as the input time series
lengthens. We believe this is primarily due to their limited ability to handle lengthy input
time series, leading to longer sequences introducing more noise and exacerbating overfit-
ting. However, PatchTST is the only model with optimal prediction accuracy for the longest
input on both datasets. Additionally, on the ETTh1 dataset, DLinear demonstrates the high-
est prediction accuracy for the longest input time series.
Based on the analysis of the findings from the input shuffling experiment and extending
the lookback window experiment, we propose that the insufficient prediction capabilities of
current complex models can be primarily attributed to two key factors: (1) their limited abil-
ity to utilize the sequential information inherent in the time series effectively, and (2) their
susceptibility to overfitting and noise interference.
6.4.3 Assessment of trend and season information mining capability
Based on the results of multivariate and univariate time series prediction experiments, it is
apparent that models incorporating the method of time series decomposition tend to exhibit
superior prediction accuracy. For models that employ time series decomposition methods,
the trend term and the season term are the temporal terms they most aspire to extract. To
further explore the performance of the aforementioned models in time series decomposition,
trend, and seasonal term extraction, and overall prediction capabilities, we will train and test
these models on an artificial dataset with the explicit trend and seasonal terms. Using this
dataset, we can clearly observe the differences between the model outputs for the trend and
seasonal terms and their corresponding true values. Next, we will provide an overview of
the artificial dataset, including the process of generating the trend and seasonal terms.
Artificial Dataset: The artificial dataset consists of two terms: the trend term and the sea-
son term. Specifically, the trend term at the tth time step in each instance follows the equation
b(t)= 1 , while the season term at the tth time step in each instance follows the equation
eβ0(t
−
β1)
s(t)=A 1 cos(2πf 1 t)+A 2 cos(2πf 2 t). The parameters used for generating the dataset are
as follows: β 0 = − 0.2, β 1 =L, A 1 =A 2 =0.15, f 1 = 1 1 0 , and f 2 = 1 1 3 . In this experiment,
the artificial dataset contains 16,847 instances. During the training phase, the instances in the
training set are represented as x i =[b(1)+s(1+i),...,b(L+O)+s(L+O+i)]+ξ i,
where ξ i represents Gaussian-distributed noise with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation
of 0.05.
In this experiment, we set both the input and output lengths of the time series to 96. The
dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets following a ratio of 6:2:2, uti-
lizing a batch size of 16. The reported outcomes are derived from the mean results of five
distinct and independent experiments.
Table 9 presents the predictions of different models incorporating time-series decom-
position on the artificial dataset. Figure 18 shows the models’ prediction accuracy for the
trend terms. Among the models evaluated for trend term prediction on the artificial dataset,
Fedformer, TDformer, and DLinear demonstrate superior performance. Fedformer is the
best, which shows improvements of 3.14% and 6.18% in MAE and MSE for trend term pre-
diction compared to TDformer, and 26.24% and 48.43% compared to DLinear. Fedformer,
TDformer, and DLinear all use simple trend information extraction methods, such as mean
1 3

23 Page 52 of 67 X. Song et al.
filtering and linear layers. This indicates that simple techniques can effectively extract trend
information, while complex methods like N-BEATS and ETSformer may suffer from a cer-
tain degree of overfitting in accurately predicting trend terms.
The predictions for the season term are depicted in Fig. 19, and Table 9 provides an over-
view of the season term predictions for each model. Based on the aforementioned findings, it
becomes apparent that the top-performing models for season-term prediction are Fedformer,
TDformer, and ETSformer. Notably, all of these models employ frequency domain-based
approaches to process season terms. Among the three methods, Fedformer has the strongest
ability to extract seasonal terms. Compared to TDformer, Fedformer improves the MAE and
MSE for season-term prediction by 26.65% and 43.07%, respectively. Similarly, compared
to ETSformer, Fedformer shows improvements of 29.17% in MAE and 44.17% in MSE for
season-term prediction.
Based on the aforementioned results of season term prediction, it becomes evident that
models that utilize frequency domain-based methods outperform other models that rely on
time domain-based methods. Therefore, it can be concluded that processing the Fourier
components in the frequency domain is an effective approach for capturing the inherent
periodic information present in the time series.
By integrating the predictions of both trend and season terms from the models, we notice
a positive correlation between their predictive capabilities. Specifically, a more accurate
prediction of season terms aligns with a better prediction of trend terms across the majority
of models. We propose that this phenomenon can be attributed to most models’ iterative
decomposition of trend and season terms. The prediction accuracy of one term directly
influences the subsequent decomposition of the remaining terms.
6.4.4 Assessing the efficacy of attention modules
Drawing upon the outcomes of multivariate and univariate time series prediction experi-
ments, it becomes evident that most Transformer-based models demonstrate superior
prediction performance compared to other models. The main difference between Trans-
former-based models lies in their internal Attention modules. Therefore, in the following we
will analyze these Attention modules to explore their contributions to the models’ overall
predictive capabilities and evaluate their complexities.
To examine the impact of different Attention modules on the model’s prediction capabil-
ity, we employ the Transformer as the baseline framework in our experiments. Subsequently,
we replace the Attention modules with the test objects to facilitate a comparative analysis
of their effects on prediction accuracy. Additionally, we fine-tune the hidden layer dimen-
sions of the test objects to ensure consistent space complexity. This adjustment is necessary
because LogSparse Attention, LSH Attention, and ProSparse Attention have been optimized
in terms of space complexity compared to the vanilla Attention modules. To ensure a fair
comparison, we aligned the space complexity of the test subjects to a similar scale.
We keep a consistent batch size of 8 and set the model with an input time series length
L=96 and a predicted time series length O =96. The rest of the experimental config-
urations align with those utilized in the multivariate time series prediction experiments
described in Sect. 6.4.1.
1 3

Deep learning-based time series forecasting Page 53 of 67 23
Table 10 demonstrates that Patch Attention in PatchTST significantly improves the predic-
tion capability of the Attention mechanism. When compared with the vanilla Attention mod-
ule, Patch Attention exhibits substantial accuracy enhancements on the ETTh1 dataset, with
improvements of 17.95% and 30.06% in MAE and MSE, respectively. Additionally, Patch
Attention achieves an impressive 85.27% improvement in MSE on the Exchange dataset.
These results indicate that aggregating short-term time steps collectively significantly enhances
the capacity of the attention mechanism to capture temporal information within a time series.
Furthermore, our experiments in Sect. 6.4.1 reveal the notable performance of Fedformer
and Crossformer. However, it is worth noting that their attention modules, FA and DAt-
tention, exhibit subpar performance in this specific experiment. We believe that the pri-
mary factor contributing to this outcome is the absence of space complexity limitations
on their attention modules during the experiments conducted in Sect. 6.4.1. However, the
space complexity of FA and DAttention significantly surpasses that of the vanilla Attention
module. To maintain consistency in space complexity across all experimental subjects, the
dimensions of the hidden layer in FA and DAttention are compressed to a smaller scale in
this experiment, resulting in their subpar prediction accuracies.
According to the introduction in Sect. 4, numerous models based on the Attention mech-
anism have optimized their complexity to meet the demands of long-term time series fore-
casting tasks. Consequently, we delve into the complexity of these optimized models and
examine their corresponding prediction performance.
We uniformly set the batch size to 8. All optimized models are trained on the ETTh1
dataset with an input time series length of L=96 and predicted time series lengths of
O = 48,96,336 . Following the original works (Nie et al. 2022; Zhang and Yan 2022;
{ }
Liu et al. 2021; Kitaev et al. 2020; Li et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2021), the remaining hyper-
parameters of these models are set to their optimal values.
Next, we will analyze the performance of these models from two perspectives: time com-
plexity and space complexity. Firstly, regarding time complexity, we observe that Reformer
demonstrates superior prediction performance while maintaining a low time complexity.
This observation is illustrated in Fig. 20 and summarized in Table 11. Specifically, Reformer
exhibits the shortest test time, reducing 10.14% compared to LogTrans, the model with the
second-best test time. Additionally, on the ETTh1 dataset, Reformer showcases significant
improvements in MAE by 14.03% and MSE by 18.42% compared to LogTrans. One of
the distinctive features of Reformer is incorporating the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
Attention mechanism. This mechanism partitions the time steps into groups using a hash
function, limiting the computation of similarity relationships to time steps within the same
group. As a result, the complexity of the Attention mechanism is effectively reduced.
When considering space complexity, our analysis reveals that models utilizing the patch
slicing method, such as PatchTST and Pyraformer, demonstrate distinct advantages while
maintaining high prediction accuracy. In particular, these models demonstrate even more
pronounced benefits in space complexity when dealing with long-term time series. In
Fig. 21 and Table 12, we observe that for a prediction length of 336, PatchTST exhibits a
memory occupation that is 10.93% lower than that of LogTrans. Additionally, PatchTST
showcases significant improvements in MAE by 28.83% and in MSE by 42.09% compared

length, and the vertical axis represents the maximum memory occupation

exhibits a memory occupation that is 3.00% lower than LogTrans. Moreover, Pyraformer
surpasses LogTrans in prediction accuracy with a 4.10% improvement in MAE and a 4.27%
improvement in MSE on the ETTh1 dataset.

Through an analysis of the prediction ability and complexity of the Attention module, we
have observed that the patch-slicing approach effectively enhances the module’s prediction
capability. Additionally, this approach significantly reduces the complexity of the Attention
module by processing shorter lengths of time series data. The benefits of complexity opti-
mization through patch slicing become more apparent as the length of the input time series
increases. While other sparse methods may also optimize the module’s complexity, they often
result in information loss, potentially impacting the prediction performance to some extent.
7 Conclusion and future directions
In this paper, we comprehensively examine the principal models used for time series fore-
casting during the 10-year period from 2014 to 2024. Our focus is on analyzing the underly-
ing processing logic employed by these models. Specifically, we investigate the correlation
relationships between time steps and the interdependencies among time series variables.
We then present approaches explicitly tailored for long-term time series forecasting tasks.
Furthermore, we provide a concise overview of commonly employed loss functions in time
series forecasting. In the section dedicated to comparative experiments, we conduct thor-
ough investigations into the performance of the principal models for both univariate and
multivariate time series prediction tasks. We meticulously explore and analyze the chal-
lenges of overfitting and noise interference in existing complex models. Throughout our
investigation, we identify the distinct advantages of employing simple methods for trend
term prediction and employing methods based on frequency domain for season term pre-
diction. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the patch-slicing method applied to the
Attention mechanism by assessing its performance in terms of prediction accuracy and
complexity. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of existing research findings, we pro-
pose potential research directions within the field of time series prediction. These directions
encompass the following areas:
Mining Dependencies among Time Steps: Existing models have utilized time series
decomposition methods to extract temporal information such as trends and seasonal pat-
terns, but these models still face limitations in effectively mining this information. Explor-
ing seasonal information in the frequency domain remains a promising direction for future
research. Additionally, capturing time-scale information, non-stationary patterns, and other
relevant time series information is becoming increasingly important.
Mining Relationships among Time-Series Variables: In datasets related to traffic or
weather, there is an inherent correlation among time-series signals from different sensors.
Therefore, exploring the correlation information between time-series variables is crucial for
such datasets. However, existing models have paid less attention to extracting relationships
among time-series variables. Effectively utilizing these relationships remains an important
research direction.
Complexity Optimization of Models for Long-term Time-Series Prediction: As the length
of the predicted sequence increases, the computational cost of models becomes more bur-
densome. This issue is particularly prominent in Transformer-based models. Although some
algorithms have explored complexity optimization for the Attention mechanism, they often
face the challenge of information loss. Therefore, optimizing the computational cost of the
1 3

23 Page 56 of 67 X. Song et al.
Attention mechanism without sacrificing prediction accuracy remains a key area for further
exploration and research.
Investigation of Overfitting in Complex Models for Time-Series Prediction: Relevant
experiments in this paper indicate that existing complex models often suffer from overfit-
ting and noise interference, leading to prediction performance that is sometimes inferior
to simpler models. Therefore, mitigating overfitting and reducing the impact of noise and
outliers remain important research directions.
Exploring Flexible Prediction Models: Current time series prediction models are often
constrained by the fixed length of input and output sequences, meaning they can only be
used for predetermined prediction lengths. If the prediction length or position changes, these
models must be redesigned and retrained. There is a critical need to develop time series
prediction models that can adapt to flexible prediction scenarios, accommodating changes in
prediction length and position without requiring extensive redesign or retraining.
Addressing the non-stationarity of time series: Although deep learning-based models
do not require input sequences to be stationary, the non-stationarity of time series, par-
ticularly the differences in statistical characteristics between the training and test sets, can
often impact the model’s predictive accuracy. Therefore, exploring and modeling changes
in the statistical properties of time series is a crucial research direction that can significantly
enhance predictive accuracy. Research in this area is still in its early stages.
Probabilistic Forecasting: Probabilistic forecasting (Gneiting et al. 2007; Salinas et al.
2020), which involves estimating the future probability distribution of a time series based
on its past behavior, is a key area for optimizing predictive models. This approach not only
improves the robustness and interpretability of models but also equips them with capabili-
ties for risk assessment and management, which are essential in many real-world applica-
tions. Currently, deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting face several challenges,
including the development of more effective loss functions, improved evaluation metrics,
and novel model architectures tailored for random processes and probability estimation.

This study developed a desktop-based Budget Management System using
Visual Basic .NET 2015 and a MySQL database to address the growing need
for  simple,  secure,  and  offline  financial  management  tools.  The  system
enables  users  to  record,  update,  and  review  income  and  expenses  while
automatically  generating  summaries  of  total  income,  total  expenses,  and
current  balance.  Designed  under  the  Software  Development  Life  Cycle
(SDLC) framework, it prioritizes usability, reliability, and privacy by storing
all  data  locally  and  eliminating  dependency  on  internet  connectivity  or
subscription-based  platforms.  Testing  results  confirm  that  the  system
performs  efficiently,  remains  stable  even  with  large  datasets,  and  is
intuitive  for  users  of  varying  technical  backgrounds.  Beyond  its  practical
value,  the  system  serves  educational  and  developmental  purposes  by
illustrating  principles  of  database  integration,  user  interface  design,  and
software  engineering  in  Visual  Basic  .NET.  Although  current  limitations
include manual installation and single-user operation, these provide clear
directions  for  future  improvement,  such  as  automated  setup,  cross-
platform  compatibility,  and  advanced  visualization  features.  Overall,  the
project demonstrates that accessible and privacy-oriented technology can
significantly  improve  personal  financial  management  while  promoting
financial literacy and independence.

|  INTRODUCTION

Effective financial management has become an essential skill in an era characterized by economic instability, rising
living  costs,  and  employment  uncertainty.  The  increasing  financial  pressures  faced  by  households  globally  have
underscored  the  importance  of  systematic  approaches  to  budgeting  and  expenditure  control.  Studies  indicate  that
individuals who actively manage their finances are more likely to achieve financial stability and make sound economic
decisions (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014; Fernandes, Lynch, & Netemeyer, 2014; Xiao & O’Neill, 2016). However, many still
struggle to maintain consistent financial discipline, often due to limited access to reliable tools for recording, monitoring,

and  analyzing  personal  financial  transactions  (Ameriks,  Caplin,  &  Leahy,  2003;  Shim  et  al.,  2010).  Technological
advancement has made financial management more accessible through the development of budget management systems
and financial tracking software. Early research in this domain has highlighted the potential of combining programming
languages with relational databases to create user-oriented systems that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of financial
record  keeping  (Patel  &  Patel,  2016).  The  integration  of  programming  environments  such  as  Visual  Basic  .NET  with
databases like MySQL enables the creation of applications that automate data handling, reduce manual computation, and
provide  real-time  feedback  to  users  (Oracle  Corporation,  2023;  Microsoft  Corporation,  2015).  Prior  works,  including
those  by  Andriana  et  al.  (2021)  and  Tafonao  et  al.  (2023),  demonstrated  the  utility  of  database-driven  systems  for
managing organizational budgets and local government finances, emphasizing structured data handling and accuracy in
reporting. Similarly, studies by Riadi et al. (2024), Setiawan (2025), and Ultariani et al. (2020) have illustrated how Visual
Basic and MySQL-based applications can efficiently support financial and operational processes within various sectors.
Although these projects focused primarily on institutional or business contexts, their methodological foundations can be
adapted  for  personal  financial  management.  The  development  of  a  desktop-based  budget  management  system  offers
several  advantages  over  cloud-based  alternatives.  Unlike  web  or  mobile  applications  that  require  continuous
connectivity  and  often  involve  third-party  data  storage,  desktop  systems  maintain  user  privacy  by  storing  financial
records locally. This model is particularly relevant in regions where internet access remains limited or unreliable. Visual
Basic .NET provides a versatile environment for designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing data operations
through the ADO.NET framework, while MySQL ensures structured data management and fast query execution (Troelsen
& Japikse, 2017; Oracle Corporation, 2023). The combination of these technologies supports the creation of applications
that are functional, secure, and adaptable for personal use.

Traditional  methods  such  as  handwritten  ledgers  or  basic  spreadsheets  often  fail  to  meet  the  expectations  of
modern users who seek immediacy, automation, and accuracy in financial analysis. These manual approaches are time-
consuming and prone to error, limiting their effectiveness for users who require dynamic and reliable insights into their
income and expenses (Grable & Joo, 2004). Contemporary research in behavioral economics also suggests that accessible
budgeting tools can encourage more deliberate spending and saving behavior by enhancing individuals’ awareness of
their  financial  status  (Thaler  &  Sunstein,  2008;  Ramsey,  2013).  The  current  study  builds  on  this  understanding  by
developing a desktop-based Budget Management System using Visual Basic .NET 2015 and MySQL, designed to help users
systematically record income and expenses, track financial trends, and manage their budgets with improved precision.
The  system  is  structured  to  operate  offline,  providing  a  private  and  cost-free  alternative  to  commercial  financial
management software. It enables users to perform core operations such as recording, updating, deleting, and reviewing
financial  transactions  through  a  simple  and  organized  interface.  Moreover,  the  system  generates  summaries  of  total
income,  total  expenses,  and  current  balance,  allowing  users  to  evaluate  their  financial  position  at  any  time.  Its
development  follows  the  Software  Development  Life  Cycle  (SDLC)  methodology,  ensuring  systematic  planning,
implementation,  and  testing  throughout  all  phases.  From  a  broader  perspective,  the  system  not  only  addresses  the
practical need for accessible financial tools but also contributes educational and developmental value. It serves as an
applied model for students and novice programmers learning how to integrate Visual Basic .NET with MySQL for desktop
applications. Similar to the work of Andriana et al. (2021) and Tafonao et al. (2023), this research emphasizes the balance
between  technical  reliability  and  usability,  aiming  to  produce  a  resource  that  is  both  functionally  effective  and
pedagogically  instructive.  The  open-source  nature  of  the  system  further  encourages  collaborative  enhancement  and
adaptation across different contexts, fostering innovation in financial technology development. Ultimately, the evolution
of budget management systems reflects a continuing shift toward technological empowerment in personal finance. By
combining  intuitive  programming  environments  with  robust  database  management  systems,  such  tools  enable
individuals to manage resources more strategically and strengthen their financial independence (Patel & Patel, 2016;
Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014). The present research therefore seeks to advance this paradigm through the development of a
Budget Management System that is efficient, private, and adaptable to diverse user needs.

|  LITERATURE REVIEW

The foundation of this research lies in previous studies that explore budget management principles, personal finance
systems, and the technological frameworks that support them. Budget management is  broadly defined as a structured
process of planning, organizing, monitoring, and controlling financial resources to achieve financial stability and long-term
goals.  Scholars  in  financial  literacy  and  behavioral  economics  emphasize  that  individuals  who  consistently  record  and
evaluate their income and expenses tend to make more rational financial decisions, maintain savings habits, and reduce
exposure to debt (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014; Fernandes, Lynch, & Netemeyer, 2014; Xiao & O’Neill, 2016). Earlier methods
such as manual record-keeping or spreadsheet-based tracking, though useful, have proven insufficient in providing the
accuracy, immediacy, and automation required in contemporary financial management. Over time, these practices have
evolved  into  more  systematic  and  technology-assisted  approaches  that  incorporate  behavioral  analysis  and  predictive

functions,  reinforcing  what  researchers  describe  as  the  tracking  effect—a  behavioral  outcome  in  which  consistent
monitoring enhances awareness and financial discipline (Ameriks, Caplin, & Leahy, 2003; Shim et al., 2010). Technological
innovation  has  significantly  shaped  the  evolution  of  personal  finance  management  systems.  Early  software  relied  on
manual  data  input  and  user-generated  formulas,  offering  marginal  improvements  over  traditional  methods.  The
introduction  of  specialized  software  in  the  late  twentieth  century,  such  as  Quicken  and  Microsoft  Money,  introduced
automated  transaction  categorization  and  integration  with  banking  institutions,  marking  a  turning  point  in  financial
technology. However, these systems often entailed complex interfaces and high costs that limited their accessibility for
average users. The subsequent proliferation of mobile technology and cloud computing brought about a new generation
of  applications  such  as  Mint,  YNAB  (You  Need  A  Budget),  and  PocketGuard,  which  provide  real-time  transaction
synchronization, goal tracking, and machine learning–based expense categorization. Although such applications enhance
convenience and analytical capability, they also raise persistent concerns about data privacy, dependency on third-party
services, and the long-term affordability of subscription-based business models (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008; Ramsey, 2013).
Consequently, there remains a clear need for offline, user-controlled systems that protect financial data while remaining
functionally reliable and easy to use.

The technological frameworks most  relevant to this research—Visual Basic .NET and MySQL—offer practical and
sustainable  solutions  for  building  such  systems.  Visual  Basic  .NET,  an  object-oriented  programming  language  within
Microsoft’s .NET Framework, facilitates the rapid development of desktop applications with intuitive graphical interfaces
(Microsoft  Corporation,  2015;  Troelsen  &  Japikse,  2017).  It  provides  robust  libraries  for  user  interface  design,  data
connectivity  through ADO.NET, and comprehensive  error handling, making it an ideal platform for developers  seeking
efficiency and reliability. MySQL, developed and maintained by Oracle Corporation, complements Visual Basic .NET as an
open-source relational database management system recognized for its scalability, reliability, and support for standard
SQL  operations  (Oracle  Corporation,  2023).  The  integration  of  Visual  Basic  .NET  with  MySQL,  typically  implemented
through the MySQL Connector/NET driver, allows seamless communication between front-end and back-end components.
This combination is widely adopted in academic and commercial projects due to its flexibility, community support, and
suitability for small to medium-sized applications (Patel & Patel, 2016). Prior research in this area has also highlighted the
importance  of  system  usability  and  user-centered  design.  Studies  by  Andriana  et  al.  (2021)  and  Tafonao  et  al.  (2023)
demonstrate that systems built with Visual Basic .NET and MySQL can enhance budget accuracy and transparency within
institutional  or  governmental  settings.  Similarly,  Riadi  et  al.  (2024),  Setiawan  (2025),  and  Ultariani  et  al.  (2020)  have
shown that the same technological combination effectively supports transactional and operational applications in business
and  retail  contexts.  These  findings  affirm  the  technical  robustness  of  Visual  Basic  .NET  and  MySQL  integration  while
revealing a gap in applications tailored specifically to personal finance. User experience research further suggests that
interface simplicity plays a crucial role in determining long-term adoption and effectiveness. Applications that minimize
the  cognitive  and  procedural  “friction”  involved  in  data  entry  are  associated  with  higher  engagement  and  improved
financial  outcomes.  In  this  respect,  the  development  of  intuitive,  focused  tools  that  streamline  interaction  without
unnecessary complexity remains a vital direction in financial software design.

Desktop-based systems continue to hold unique advantages despite the rise of web and mobile alternatives. They can
function offline, provide faster local processing for data-intensive tasks, and preserve complete user control over stored
information.  These  attributes  are  especially  valuable  for  users  in  regions  with  unreliable  internet  connectivity  or
heightened privacy concerns. Furthermore, desktop applications avoid recurring subscription costs, making them more
inclusive for users with limited financial means. However, while many studies have validated the technical and behavioral
benefits of financial management systems, relatively few have explored solutions that merge usability, offline operation,
and privacy preservation within a single, open-access platform. The current research responds to this gap by developing
a desktop-based Budget Management System that integrates the dependability of Visual Basic .NET and MySQL with an
emphasis on simplicity and  user autonomy. In summary, the literature demonstrates a clear progression from manual
financial  tracking  methods  to  sophisticated,  technology-driven  systems  that  leverage  software  integration  to  improve
decision-making  and  financial  literacy.  Prior  research  provides  a  strong  empirical  and  technological  foundation  for
developing  practical  financial  management  tools,  yet  also  highlights  the  limitations  of  existing  commercial  and  cloud-
based solutions. By synthesizing these insights, the present study builds on established approaches to deliver an offline,
accessible, and privacy-conscious budget management system designed to empower individuals to monitor and control
their finances effectively.

|  METHODOLOGY

The  development  of  the  Budget  Management  System  was  guided  by  a  systematic  approach  rooted  in  established
software  engineering  principles  to  ensure  functionality,  reliability,  and  user-centered  design.  This  section  outlines  the
research design, system architecture, database structure, implementation strategy, testing procedures, and the tools and
technologies  utilized  throughout  the  development  lifecycle.  The  chosen  methodology  aimed  to  produce  a  robust

application  capable  of  meeting  user  needs  while  maintaining  technical  integrity  and  usability.  This  study  employed  a
developmental research design, an approach particularly suited for creating and evaluating new technological solutions.
It  emphasizes  iterative  refinement  through  continuous  design,  development,  testing,  and  evaluation,  with  each  phase
contributing insights that inform subsequent improvements. The project followed the  Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC)  framework,  which  provides  a  structured  process  consisting  of  six  key  stages:  planning,  analysis,  design,
implementation,  testing,  and  deployment.  Each  phase  contributed  to  ensuring  that  the  system  evolved  logically  from
conceptualization to completion. The planning phase focused on identifying core requirements based on user expectations
and a review of existing budget management systems. This stage established the system’s main objectives, which included
enabling users to record and track income and expenses, view transaction histories, modify data entries, and generate
financial  summaries  efficiently.  Following  this,  the  analysis  phase  examined  both  functional  and  non-functional
requirements.  The  functional  requirements  defined  the  core  system  behaviors  such  as  recording  transactions  with
relevant  details—amounts,  remarks,  transaction  types,  and  dates—along  with  the  ability  to  update,  delete,  filter,  and
calculate income and expenditure totals.

Non-functional  requirements  addressed  performance  expectations  including  interface  usability,  data  integrity,
reliability,  and  maintainability  to  ensure  smooth  operation  and  scalability  for  future  enhancement.  The  design  phase
translated these specifications into an integrated system structure encompassing both architecture and interface layout.
The application adopted a  two-tier client-server architecture, separating  the presentation and data layers to achieve a
balance between simplicity and efficiency. The presentation layer, implemented using  Visual Basic .NET, managed user
interaction  through  forms,  controls,  and  event-driven  operations,  while  the  data  layer,  built  on  MySQL,  handled  data
storage, retrieval, and integrity management. This separation ensured modularity, making the system easier to maintain
and extend. Database design was a critical component of the development process. The database, titled db_budget, was
designed  to  support  transaction  management  efficiently  while  maintaining  accuracy  and  scalability.  Its  core  table,
transactions,  included  several  key  fields:  transaction_id  as  a  primary  key  with  auto-increment  functionality  for  unique
identification; amount as a decimal field for precise financial values; remarks as a variable character field allowing users
to  add  context  to  transactions;  transaction_type  as  an  enumerated  field  limited  to  “Received”  and  “Expense”  for
consistency;  and  transaction_date  for  chronological  organization  and  filtering.  An  additional  created_at  timestamp
automatically  recorded  entry  times  to  provide  an  audit  trail,  thereby  improving  transparency  and  traceability.  The
implementation phase transformed the design into a fully functional system coded in  Visual Basic .NET 2015 using the
Microsoft  Visual  Studio  IDE.  The  MySQL  database  was  accessed  via  ADO.NET  and  the  MySQL  Connector/NET  driver,
ensuring secure and efficient data communication. The system interface was divided into intuitive sections: an input area
for entering transaction data (including textboxes for amount and remarks, a combobox for transaction type, and a date
picker); an action section with buttons for saving, updating, deleting, clearing, and searching records; a data display section
that utilized a DataGridView control to present stored transactions in tabular form; and a summary panel that dynamically
calculated total income, total expenses, and the current balance. Core functionalities were implemented to optimize user
experience and data integrity.

The  Save  feature  validated  input  data  before  executing  parameterized  SQL  INSERT  commands  to  prevent  SQL
injection, while the Update feature allowed modifications to existing transactions through SQL UPDATE queries. The Delete
feature  included  confirmation  prompts  to  prevent  accidental  data  loss,  and  the  Search  function  allowed  users  to  filter
transactions within specific date ranges using WHERE clauses. Summary calculations employed SQL aggregate functions
to compute totals and current balances in real time, while color-coded visual cues—green for surplus and red for deficit—
provided immediate feedback on financial status.  The testing phase verified that the system met its design objectives and
functional requirements through a series of rigorous evaluations. Unit testing was used to confirm that individual modules
performed  as  expected.  Integration  testing  assessed  the  coordination  between  the  Visual  Basic  .NET  interface  and  the
MySQL database, ensuring seamless communication and data consistency. Functional testing confirmed that features such
as transaction recording, modification, and filtering operated correctly. Usability testing, conducted with a sample group
of  users,  evaluated  the  clarity  of  the  interface  and  revealed  opportunities  for  improvement  in  navigation  and  visual
presentation.  Performance  testing  assessed  system  responsiveness  under  varying  loads,  confirming  that  the  system
maintained  efficient  processing  speeds  even  when  managing  large  datasets.  The  selection  of  development  tools  and
technologies was based on practicality, stability, and accessibility. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 was used as the integrated
development  environment  for  its  comprehensive  debugging  and  project  management  capabilities.  Visual  Basic  .NET
served as the primary programming language, chosen for its simplicity and strong graphical interface support. MySQL 5.7
or higher was selected for reliable database management,  while  XAMPP simplified  database configuration and  hosting
through its bundled Apache and MySQL services. phpMyAdmin was utilized as an auxiliary tool for managing and testing
database  operations  during  both  development  and  deployment  phases.  System  requirements  were  defined  to  ensure
accessibility across a broad range of personal computers.

Hardware requirements included a processor equivalent to Intel Core i3, at least 4GB of RAM, 500MB of available
storage,  and  a  display  resolution  of  1024x768  pixels.  The  software  prerequisites  included  Windows  7  or  higher,  .NET
Framework 4.5 or newer, and an installed MySQL environment provided through XAMPP or similar packages. Deployment

was designed to be user-friendly yet technically sound. The system was distributed as a compressed archive containing
the Visual Basic .NET project files, executable program, SQL script for initializing the database, and documentation with
installation and usage instructions. To activate the application, users were required to install XAMPP, create a database
named db_budget using phpMyAdmin, import the SQL script, and run the executable. Once connected to the database, the
system  operated  independently  of  internet  connectivity,  providing  a  fully  offline  solution.  Throughout  development,
strong emphasis was placed on code quality, maintainability, and error resilience. Modular programming principles were
applied, ensuring that each function served a distinct purpose. Meaningful variable names and inline documentation were
included to enhance readability and facilitate future updates. Error-handling mechanisms were implemented across all
major  operations  to  prevent  unexpected  crashes  and  to  provide  informative  feedback  to  users.  In  conclusion,  the
methodology  combined  systematic  analysis  with  iterative  development  to  create  a  reliable  and  efficient  Budget
Management  System.  The  use  of  the  SDLC  framework  ensured  that  each  phase—from  planning  to  deployment—was
executed  in  an  organized  and  traceable  manner.  The  integration  of  Visual  Basic  .NET  and  MySQL  provided  a  strong
technical foundation, while the testing and design principles ensured that the final application achieved both functionality
and user accessibility. This methodological rigor establishes a solid base for future enhancements as user requirements
evolve and new technologies emerge.

|  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Discussion

The implementation of the Budget Management System produced a fully functional desktop application that
meets  the  predefined  objectives  and  functional  requirements.  The  completed  system  provides  users  with  an
intuitive and visually organized interface, ensuring that all essential operations—such as data entry, modification,
and analysis—can  be  performed  efficiently  within  a  single dashboard.  This section outlines the design  features,
functional  components,  and  performance  outcomes  resulting  from  the  development  and  testing  stages.  Upon
launching the application, users are presented with a main dashboard that consolidates all financial management
tasks  in  one  workspace.  The  input  panel,  located  at  the  top  of  the  interface,  contains  clearly  labeled  fields  for
entering  transaction  details.  Users  can  input  the  transaction  amount  through  a  numeric  textbox  with  built-in
validation to prevent invalid entries. Descriptive notes can be added in the remarks field, which helps users recall
the nature of each transaction, such as “Salary,” “Groceries,” or “Electricity bill.” The transaction type dropdown
menu offers two choices—Received for income and Expense for expenditure—ensuring consistent categorization.
The  integrated  date  picker  automatically  selects  the  current  date  by  default  but  also  allows  modification  for
retroactive  or  future  entries,  enabling  flexible  data  management.  Directly  below  the  input  area  lies  the  action
toolbar, which includes five core buttons: Save, Update, Delete, Clear, and Search.

Each button corresponds to a key function in the system. The Save button validates all inputs before executing
a parameterized SQL INSERT command that adds the new record to the MySQL database, preventing SQL injection
vulnerabilities. After a successful entry, the form clears automatically, and the transaction list updates in real time.
The Update button activates when an existing transaction is selected from the table, allowing users to revise details
without altering the transaction ID. The Delete button removes a transaction after a confirmation prompt, reducing
accidental deletions. The Clear button resets all fields to their default state, while the Search button triggers date-
based filtering, allowing users to specify start and end dates for transaction analysis. The central component of the
interface is the Data Display Table, which uses a DataGridView control to present all recorded transactions in an
organized tabular format.  Each row represents  a financial  entry,  with  columns for  transaction  ID, amount, type,
date,  and  remarks.  Transactions  are  displayed  with  clear  formatting,  including  currency  symbols  and  date
alignment for readability. Users can sort the table by any column and select specific rows to modify or delete entries.
The table updates automatically after each operation, ensuring data consistency without manual refresh.

Figure 1. Budget Management System Interface in Visual Basic .NET

A summary panel positioned below the table provides users with real-time financial statistics. It displays three
core  indicators:  Total  Income,  Total  Expenses,  and  Current  Balance,  all  calculated  dynamically  through  SQL
aggregate functions. These values automatically refresh after any data change, offering an immediate overview of
financial standing. Visual cues enhance interpretation—positive balances appear in green, signaling surplus, while
negative  balances  appear  in  red,  indicating  deficit.  The  color-coded  feedback  helps  users  quickly  assess  their
financial  condition  without  requiring  manual  calculation.  An  additional  date  filtering  function  enables  users  to
analyze  financial  data  across  specific  periods.  By  selecting  a  start  and  end  date,  users  can  focus  on  defined
timeframes—such as a week, month, or quarter—to evaluate spending and income patterns. The system adjusts
both  the  data  grid  and  the  summary  panel  to  reflect  filtered  results,  allowing  targeted  financial  analysis  and
supporting  informed  budgeting  decisions.  Comprehensive  testing  confirmed  the  reliability  and  accuracy  of  the
Budget Management System.

Unit  testing  verified  the  correctness  of  individual  components,  including  income  and  expense  recording,
updating,  and  deletion  processes.  Integration  testing  ensured  smooth  data  communication  between  the  Visual
Basic .NET interface and the MySQL database, with all SQL operations executing successfully. Function al testing
validated  that  all  user-facing  features  performed  as  specified—recording,  viewing,  filtering,  updating,  and
logical  or  runtime  errors.  Performance  testing  further
summarizing  transactions—without  producing
demonstrated  the  system’s  stability  under  varying  data  volumes.  Even  with  databases  containing  thousands  of
records,  all  core  operations  executed  within  acceptable  timeframes.  Transaction  insertion,  modification,  and
deletion were typically completed in under half a second, while data retrieval and aggregation queries remained
responsive  at  under  one  second  for  databases  containing  up  to  5,000  entries.  Usability  testing,  conducted  with
participants of diverse technical backgrounds, confirmed that the interface was easy to navigate. Users completed
all  tasks  successfully  with  minimal  guidance  and  reported  that  the  color-coded  balance  indicators  and  minimal
design enhanced the overall clarity of the system.

4.2 Result

The evaluation of the Budget Management System highlights several key strengths and practical implications,
alongside challenges and areas for future enhancement. The foremost advantage of the system lies in its simplicity
and  accessibility.  Unlike  many  commercial  financial  management  tools  that  require  continuous  internet
connectivity  or  subscriptions,  this  application  offers  offline  functionality,  eliminating  dependence  on  external

servers  and  recurring  costs.  This  makes  it  particularly  valuable  in  regions  with  limited  connectivity  or  for
individuals seeking full control over their financial data. Data privacy emerged as a defining characteristic of the
system’s design philosophy. Because all data is stored locally, users retain exclusive ownership of their information,
avoiding the risks associated with cloud-based applications. This feature addresses widespread concerns over data
breaches and unauthorized access to personal financial records. Additionally, the open-source nature of the system
enhances  transparency  and  customizability.  Users  with  programming  knowledge  can  adapt  the  application  to
specific needs—such as integrating new features, adjusting the interface, or connecting to other systems—without
relying  on  proprietary  software  providers.  The  system  also  provides  educational  and  developmental  value.  For
students and novice developers, it serves as a tangible demonstration of software engineering principles, including
database integration, interface design, and structured programming in Visual Basic .NET. The availability of well-
documented source code enables learners to understand modular code organization, SQL operations, and event-
driven programming in a real-world context. For small-scale users—such as freelancers or individuals managing
personal budgets—the system offers an effective solution for maintaining accurate financial records without the
overhead of professional accounting software. However, several limitations were identified during implementation.
The  installation  process,  which  requires  users  to  configure  MySQL  via  XAMPP  and  import  database  scripts
manually, may present challenges for non-technical users. Automating this setup through an installation wizard
would simplify deployment and broaden accessibility.

The system’s current single-user design restricts collaborative or household budgeting, where shared access
is  desirable.  Future  iterations  could  adopt  a  multi-user  architecture  incorporating  authentication  and  role
management to  enable concurrent usage.  Additionally, while  the  desktop-only  version serves  the current scope
well,  cross-platform  compatibility—particularly  for  mobile  and  macOS  environments—would  significantly
enhance usability and reach. User feedback also revealed potential areas for improvement, including the addition
of expense categorization, graphical reporting, and recurring transaction features. Integrating visual analytics, such
as pie charts or bar graphs for expense distribution and trend tracking, would allow users to interpret their data
more intuitively. Implementing automated backup and export features to CSV, Excel, or PDF formats would enhance
data  security  and  interoperability.  Multi-currency  support  and  budget  planning  tools  could  further  extend  the
application’s relevance in diverse financial contexts. From a comparative perspective, the system occupies a unique
niche  between  basic  spreadsheet  budgeting  and  complex  commercial  software  such  as  Mint,  Quicken,  or  YNAB.
While commercial solutions offer a wider range of automated features, they often introduce complexity, privacy
concerns,  and  financial  barriers.  The  Budget  Management  System,  in  contrast,  prioritizes  usability,  privacy,  and
control—key  attributes  for  users  who  value  simplicity  over  automation.  Its  lightweight  design  and  local  data
management  provide  an  attractive  alternative  for  individuals  seeking  autonomy  over  their  financial  tracking
process.  In  a  broader  context,  this  research  reinforces  the  principle  that  effective  technology  does  not  require
unnecessary complexity to deliver value. The system exemplifies user-centered design by addressing real needs—
simplicity,  control,  and  affordability—rather  than  striving  for  feature  abundance.  Its  successful  implementation
validates  that  appropriate  technology,  when  grounded  in  usability  and  accessibility,  can  substantially  improve
personal financial management practices. Looking ahead, future development may include the creation of a mobile
companion app synchronized with the desktop version, automated database configuration, and visual dashboards
for  financial  insight.  Each  enhancement  would  build  upon  the  system’s  solid  foundation  while  preserving  its
defining  characteristics:  ease  of  use,  offline  operation,  and  respect  for  user  autonomy.  In  summary,  the  Budget
Management  System  fulfills  its  objective  as  an  accessible  and  reliable  personal  finance  application.  The  results
confirm  that  the  system  performs  efficiently,  meets  all  specified  requirements,  and  offers  tangible  benefits  in
privacy,  usability,  and  educational  utility.  While  certain  technical  and  usability  limitations  remain,  they  present
opportunities for meaningful future improvement. Overall, the project demonstrates that simple, well-structured
desktop  applications  can  effectively  support  individual  financial  literacy  and  management  in  an  increasingly
complex digital economy.

|  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION

This research successfully designed and implemented a Budget Management System using Visual Basic .NET
2015  and  a  MySQL  database,  providing  a  practical,  accessible,  and  privacy-focused  tool  for  personal  financial
management. The system effectively fulfills the identified need for an easy-to-use, offline budgeting application that
enables  users  to  track  income  and  expenses,  review  transaction  history,  and  analyze  financial  behavior  in  a
structured  and  reliable  manner.  By  applying  established  software  development  principles  within  the  Software
Development  Life  Cycle  (SDLC)  framework,  the  project  demonstrates  that  efficient  and  scalable  financial
management solutions can be built using readily available technologies without imposing licensing restrictions or
subscription  costs.  Functionally,  the  Budget  Management  System  meets  all  essential  requirements  for  personal

finance  tracking.  Users  can  record,  modify,  and  delete  transactions  with  descriptive  remarks  that  provide
contextual clarity, while the system accurately distinguishes between income and expenditure entries. Automatic
calculation of total income, total expenses, and current balance provides immediate financial visibility through a
clear summary  panel  enhanced by intuitive color indicators  that signal  surplus or deficit.  The inclusion of date-
based  filtering  and  sortable  transaction  history  enables  users  to  analyze  specific  financial  periods  and  observe
spending trends over time. The integration of Visual Basic .NET with MySQL through ADO.NET ensures efficient
data management, secure access, and reliable query execution. Additionally, the interface design prioritizes clarity,
presenting all major operations within a single main form to minimize navigation and simplify user interaction.
Extensive testing validated the system’s reliability and performance. Unit and integration tests confirmed accurate
interaction  between  components,  functional  tests  demonstrated  compliance  with  all  user  requirements,  and
performance  tests  verified  that  the  system  maintains  responsiveness  even  with  large  datasets.  Usability  testing
with  participants  of  diverse  technical  backgrounds  confirmed  that  the  interface  was  intuitive  and  accessible,
requiring minimal technical expertise.

These evaluations affirm the system’s robustness, consistency, and readiness for real-world deployment. The
system  also  offers  several  advantages  that  contribute  to  its  usability  and  practicality.  Its  simplicity  ensures
accessibility for  users  with  varying technical  abilities, while its offline  capability eliminates  reliance on  internet
connectivity—an important consideration in regions with unstable access. Local data storage provides users full
control  over  their  financial  information,  addressing  concerns  about  privacy  and  security  in  cloud-based
applications.  The  open-source  nature  of  the  system  enhances  cost-effectiveness  and  encourages  collaborative
development,  allowing  students,  educators,  and  developers  to  adapt  the  software  for  educational  or  practical
purposes. The project demonstrates that user-centered design and appropriate technology can deliver impactful
solutions  without unnecessary complexity.  Despite its success,  certain  limitations were  identified.  The database
configuration  process  still  requires  manual  setup through  XAMPP and  phpMyAdmin,  which  may  challenge  non-
technical users. The application’s dependency on Windows restricts cross-platform deployment, while its single-
user design limits shared budgeting scenarios such as household or group use. Data backup must also be performed
manually, creating potential risks of data loss if users fail to perform regular backups. These limitations, though not
diminishing  the  system’s  effectiveness,  indicate  clear  directions  for  improvement.  In  the  broader  financial
technology landscape, the Budget  Management System occupies a position between basic spreadsheet tools and
feature-heavy  commercial  applications  such  as  Mint  or  YNAB.  While  commercial  systems  offer  advanced
automation and analytics, they often involve costs, privacy risks, and overwhelming complexity. In contrast, the
Budget Management System provides a lightweight, autonomous alternative emphasizing privacy, usability, and
control—characteristics  aligned  with  the  needs  of  individuals  seeking  simple  yet  reliable  budgeting  tools.  The
project  therefore  contributes  both  practically  and  academically,  offering  an  operational  financial  management
solution and a structured example of database-driven software development guided by accessibility, transparency,
and  user  empowerment.  Building  upon  the  findings  and  feedback,  several  recommendations  are  proposed  for
further  development,  deployment,  and  research  to  enhance  the  system’s  performance  and  relevance.  Future
development should prioritize simplifying installation by introducing an automated setup process that configures
the database and application environment with minimal user input. Expanding compatibility through .NET Core or
Xamarin  frameworks  would  allow  deployment  across  macOS,  Linux,  and  mobile  platforms.  Adding  expense
categorization would enable users to classify transactions by type—such as housing, food, or utilities—providing
richer financial insights.

Integrating  graphical  reports  such  as  charts  and  trend  lines  would  support  visual  analysis  of  income  and
spending patterns. Incorporating budgeting features like spending limits and notifications could promote proactive
financial planning, while  a synchronized  mobile  version would  extend usability. Automated  backups and  export
functions  to  formats  such  as  CSV,  Excel,  or  PDF  would  further  strengthen  data  protection  and  flexibility.  For
deployment and community support, developing comprehensive documentation, including installation guides and
video tutorials, would improve user adoption. Establishing an online support community could facilitate feedback
and collaborative development. Implementing ethical telemetry or usage analytics—with explicit user consent—
would provide insights into feature utilization and inform targeted improvements. Partnerships with educational
institutions and financial literacy programs could also promote broader adoption and integration into academic
contexts.  From  a  research  perspective,  future  studies  should  examine  the  system’s  long-term  impact  on  users’
financial behavior and literacy, comparing its effectiveness with commercial alternatives. Investigating factors that
influence  adoption,  usability,  and  sustained  engagement  could  inform  future  iterations  of  the  software.  Cross-
cultural  and  socio-economic  analyses  would  further  evaluate  its  adaptability  in  diverse  contexts.  The  potential
integration  of  artificial  intelligence  or  machine  learning  could  also  be  explored  to  offer  personalized  financial
insights  while  preserving  the  system’s  privacy-focused  architecture.  In  conclusion,  this  research  achieved  its
primary objective of developing a functional, user-friendly, and secure Budget Management System that empowers
individuals to manage their finances effectively. The system’s strength lies in its simplicity, offline functionality, and

undermine  its  practicality  but  instead  point  toward  opportunities  for  refinement  and  expansion.  This  project
exemplifies appropriate technology—solutions designed for usability and inclusivity rather than feature excess. Its
open-source nature ensures continued growth through community participation and educational use. Ultimately,
the  Budget  Management  System  demonstrates  that  accessible,  ethically  designed  financial  applications  can
significantly contribute to improving financial awareness, literacy, and stability among individuals navigating an
increasingly complex economic environment.

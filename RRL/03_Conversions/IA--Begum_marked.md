Abstract:

The  increasing  complexity  of  financial  systems  in  the  United  States  has  heightened  the  need  for
intelligent, data-driven approaches to assess and mitigate financial risks. Traditional statistical methods
often struggle to capture the non-linear patterns, behavioral dynamics, and real-time anomalies inherent
in  financial data. This  research proposes a machine learning-based framework to  analyze and predict
financial  risk  factors,  with  a  specific  focus  on  bankruptcy  prediction,  fraud  detection,  and  consumer
behavior trends. To predict bankruptcy, the study employs six different models—Logistic Regression,
Random  Forest,  Gradient  Boosting  (including  XGBoost  and  LightGBM),  Support  Vector  Machines
(SVM), Artificial Neural Networks,  and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models
are designed to capture both static and dynamic financial indicators. For fraud detection, the research
integrates  unsupervised  techniques  such  as  Isolation  Forest  alongside  supervised  classifiers  like
Logistic  Regression,  Random  Forest,  and  XGBoost.  Additionally,  ensemble  learning  methods  and
Recurrent  Neural  Networks  (RNN)  are  used  for  sequence-based  anomaly  detection.  To  understand
consumer  behavior  trends,  the  study  utilizes  K-Means  and  DBSCAN  clustering  for  behavioral
segmentation, along with time-series models like ARIMA and LSTM to forecast financial activities and
preferences.  To  tackle  challenges  such  as  data  imbalance,  particularly  in  fraud  detection  and
bankruptcy  prediction,  the  Synthetic  Minority  Over-sampling  Technique  (SMOTE)  is  implemented.
Feature  engineering  and  dimensionality  reduction  techniques,  such  as  Principal  Component  Analysis
(PCA), are also employed to improve model generalization. Model performance is rigorously evaluated
using various metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Area Under the Curve (AUC),
and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), depending on the specific task at hand. The findings aim to provide
predictive insights that not only enhance institutional decision-making and financial risk management
but  also  contribute  to  more  personalized  financial  services,  policy  formulation,  and  effective  fraud
mitigation strategies.

Keywords: Machine learning, bankruptcy prediction, fraud detection, financial risk analysis, predictive
analytics, time-series forecasting.

The rapid evolution of financial systems in the United States has created a critical need for advanced,
intelligent systems to manage growing complexities and vulnerabilities such as bankruptcy, fraud, and
fluctuating consumer behavior. Traditional financial risk assessment methods—though foundational—
struggle  to  accommodate  the  nonlinear  relationships  and  high-dimensional  patterns  that  modern
financial  data  exhibits.  As  a  result,  machine  learning  (ML)  has  emerged  as  a  pivotal  tool  in
transforming raw financial datasets into actionable insights that support proactive risk management and
strategic  decision-making.  Recent  research  has  shown  promising  results  in  the  application  of  ML
models  for  bankruptcy  prediction,  enabling  financial  institutions  to  assess  firm  solvency  using
historical and transactional data. For instance, Sizan et al. (2025) utilized supervised learning models to
forecast  bankruptcy  among  U.S.  businesses,  highlighting  how  algorithms  like  Random  Forest  and
SVM outperform traditional financial ratio-based models in both accuracy and adaptability [17]. Their
work  underscores  the  growing  reliability  of  ML  in  early  warning  systems  that  mitigate  financial
collapse.  Simultaneously,  fraud  detection  has  become  an  area  of  focus  where  ML—particularly
ensemble models and neural networks—can detect anomalies and evolving fraud patterns in real-time.
Sizan  et  al.  (2025)  also  explored  ML  applications  in  U.S.  credit  card  fraud  detection,  revealing  that
advanced models like Gradient Boosting and Deep Learning significantly reduce false positives while
improving sensitivity to rare fraudulent behaviors. The inclusion of both supervised and unsupervised
learning  techniques  has  allowed  researchers  to  capture  both  known  fraud  signatures  and  emerging
threats (Sizan et al., 2025 ) [18].

In  the  domain  of  consumer  behavior  analysis,  Al  Montaser  et  al.  (2025)  emphasized  the  role  of
sentiment analysis and unsupervised learning in uncovering behavioral patterns from social media data
[2]. These insights can drive marketing personalization and improve customer satisfaction by aligning
product offerings with emerging consumer preferences. Mohaimin et al. (2025) and Rana et al. (2025)
demonstrated how predictive analytics and customer churn models in the telecom and banking sectors
offer  valuable  lessons  for  modeling  customer  loyalty  and  behavioral  shifts  using  LSTM  networks,
clustering  techniques,  and  survival  analysis  [14,  15].    Beyond  these,  additional  studies  highlight  the
integration  of  time-series  forecasting  (ARIMA  and  LSTM),  anomaly  detection  methods  (Isolation
Forest),  and  data  preprocessing  strategies  such  as  SMOTE  and  PCA  to  handle  class  imbalance  and
dimensionality issues (Brown & Liu, 2023; Chen et al., 2024) [3,5]. These techniques further solidify
ML's role in driving financial resilience and consumer intelligence across sectors.

1.2 Importance Of This Research

The  significance  of  this  research  lies  in  its  potential  to  bridge  theoretical  insights  with  practical
applications across various sectors, notably finance, retail, and telecommunications, through AI-driven
predictive analytics. With the explosive growth of digital transactions and data availability, traditional
decision-making  systems  often  fail  to  capture  complex,  nonlinear  patterns  in  consumer  behavior,
financial  health,  and  fraud  activities.  Machine  learning  (ML)  models  provide  powerful  tools  for
predicting  bankruptcy,  understanding  consumer  sentiment,  detecting  fraud,  and  reducing  customer
churn, thereby offering a competitive edge for organizations in data-intensive environments (Sizan et
al., 2025; Mohaimin et al., 2025). In the financial sector, accurate bankruptcy prediction is crucial for
mitigating  systemic  risk  and  ensuring  market  stability.  AI  and  ML  models  significantly  outperform
traditional  models  by  uncovering  hidden  patterns  in  historical  financial  data,  thus  enabling  early

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

                                                                                                                             Pages: 36-54
                                                                                                                                           Volume-II, Issue-I (2025)

warning systems for potential insolvencies (Sizan et al., 2025) [17]. Likewise, advanced fraud detection
algorithms  powered  by  ensemble  learning,  deep  learning,  and  anomaly  detection  reduce  financial
losses by identifying irregularities in real time (Sizan et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023) [13, 18].

Equally  important  is  the  role  of  AI  in  enhancing  customer  engagement  strategies.  In  the  telecom
industry,  predictive  models  help  reduce  churn  by  identifying  at-risk  customers  and  recommending
tailored  retention  strategies  (Mohaimin  et  al.,  2025)  [14].  In  banking  and  finance,  similar  techniques
provide  insights  into  customer  attrition  patterns  and  allow  institutions  to  adapt  their  services
accordingly (Rana et  al., 2025;  Al Montaser et  al.,  2025) [15, 2]. Sentiment  analysis of social media
platforms further empowers businesses to decode consumer emotions and market trends, driving real-
time marketing campaigns and brand alignment with public perception (Al Montaser et al., 2025; Zarei
et al., 2024) [2, 19]. The application of AI also fosters scalability and automation across domains. From
credit  scoring  to  personalized  recommendation  systems,  ML  models  can  process  vast  datasets
efficiently, ensuring timely decisions and minimizing operational overhead (Zhang et al., 2023; Roy et
al., 2023) [20, 16]. The ethical deployment of AI systems fosters transparency and fairness, especially
when  explainable  AI  (XAI)  frameworks  are  employed  to  validate  decisions  affecting  consumers'
financial outcomes (Chakraborty & Amam, 2024) [4].

1.3 Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to investigate how artificial intelligence and machine learning
can  be  harnessed  to  promote  energy  sustainability  by  forecasting,  analyzing,  and  optimizing
consumption patterns. This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate AI-driven models that can
accurately  predict  energy  demand,  detect  usage  inefficiencies,  and  enhance  resource  distribution.  By
employing  sophisticated  machine  learning  techniques,  the  research  seeks  to  generate  actionable
insights  that  contribute  to  improved  energy  efficiency,  lower  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  broader
adoption  of  renewable  energy  solutions.  Another  key  objective  is  to  strengthen  the  resilience  and
reliability  of  energy  infrastructure  through  predictive  maintenance  and  real-time  anomaly  detection
powered  by  AI.  Additionally,  this  research  explores  the  economic  benefits  of  AI-based  energy
management,  including  cost  savings,  demand-side  efficiency,  and  market  equilibrium.  Finally,  the
study aspires to provide strategic guidance on how AI technologies can be embedded into national and
international sustainability frameworks to support effective energy governance and equitable access.

II.  Literature Review

2.1 Related Works

Numerous  studies  have  explored  the  application  of  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  in
predictive  analytics  for  business  sustainability, customer retention,  fraud  detection, and financial  risk
mitigation.  Sizan  et  al.  (2025)  developed  a  robust  machine  learning  framework  for  bankruptcy
prediction  in  US  businesses,  enhancing  financial  stability  through  early  risk  detection  and  proactive

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

                                                                                                                             Pages: 36-54

intervention strategies [17]. Al Montaser et al. (2025) investigated sentiment analysis on social media
data to uncover valuable insights into consumer behavior and business trends, demonstrating the power
of AI in real-time market intelligence [2]. Mohaimin et al. (2025) focused on customer churn prediction
in  the  US  telecom  sector,  applying  predictive  models  to  improve  retention  strategies  and  optimize
customer lifecycle management [14].

Rana  et  al.  (2025)  presented  an  AI-driven  churn  prediction  model  for  the  banking  industry,
emphasizing the strategic advantage of predictive analytics in customer relationship management and
financial planning [15]. In the financial fraud domain, Sizan et al. (2025) proposed advanced machine
learning techniques to detect credit card fraud in the USA, delivering comprehensive insights on model
performance,  data  imbalance  solutions,  and  fraud  detection  accuracy  [18].  These  foundational  works
collectively  highlight  the  rising  importance  of  AI  and  ML  in  financial  and  business  decision-making
across different sectors.

Extending beyond finance, Farooq et al. (2025) developed a machine learning pipeline for predicting e-
commerce customer satisfaction, underlining the significance of AI in enhancing user experience and
service personalization [8]. Additionally, Chen et al. (2024) employed deep learning models to forecast
sales  trends  in  retail,  facilitating  inventory  management  and  demand  planning  through  data-driven
insights [5]. Another notable contribution comes from Idris et al. (2025), who introduced a hybrid ML
model  combining  decision  trees  and  neural  networks  for  real-time  fraud  detection  in  online
transactions,  demonstrating  improved  detection  rates  and  faster  response  times  [10].  These  related
studies affirm that machine learning and AI have become indispensable  tools for modern businesses.
From  bankruptcy  prediction  and  fraud  detection  to  customer  retention  and  consumer  sentiment
analysis, AI techniques continue to offer scalable, data-informed solutions to some of the most pressing
challenges across industries.

2.2 Gaps and Challenges

While  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  applying  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  to
business  forecasting,  fraud  detection,  and  customer  retention,  several  gaps  and  challenges  remain  in
achieving consistent and scalable results across diverse sectors. A major gap lies in the generalizability
and  interpretability  of  predictive  models.  Many  existing  studies,  such  as  those  by  Mohaimin  et  al.
(2025) and Rana  et  al.  (2025), demonstrate strong performance within specific domains like telecom
and banking churn prediction; however, the models often lack transparency and are difficult to adapt to
other sectors or evolving market dynamics [14][15]. Interpretability becomes especially critical in high-
stakes  environments  like finance, where decision-makers require clarity on model rationale to  ensure
regulatory compliance and trustworthiness.

Another challenge involves data quality and imbalance, particularly in fraud detection and bankruptcy
prediction tasks. Sizan et al. (2025) noted the issue of highly imbalanced datasets in credit card fraud
detection, which skews model performance and requires advanced resampling or ensemble methods to
correct  [18].  Similar  concerns  were  raised  by  Idris  et  al.  (2025),  who  observed  that  conventional
algorithms  underperform  when  exposed  to  rare  but  high-risk  events  such  as  fraudulent  transactions
[10].  The  lack  of  real-time  adaptability  is  another  recurring  issue.  While  AI-driven  frameworks  like

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

                                                                                                                             Pages: 36-54
                                                                                                                                           Volume-II, Issue-I (2025)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

those  proposed  by  Al  Montaser  et  al.  (2025)  and  Farooq  et  al.  (2025)  provide  insights  based  on
historical or static datasets, there is limited work on models capable of continuous learning from live
data  streams  [2][8].  In  fast-changing  markets,  the  ability  to  update  and  retrain  models  on-the-fly  is
essential for maintaining accuracy and relevance.

There is also insufficient integration of domain expertise into model design, which limits the practical
applicability of many AI systems. For example, Chen et al. (2024) highlight the importance of domain-
informed  feature  engineering  in  retail  forecasting,  yet  many  studies  still  rely  on  purely  data-driven
approaches  that  overlook  business  logic  or  human  intuition  [5].  Ethical  concerns  and  data  privacy
issues  also  remain  unchecked  in  AI-based  business  applications.  As  predictive  models  become  more
pervasive in  influencing  financial decisions and customer targeting, ensuring fairness,  accountability,
and responsible data use is crucial. Yet, most current research focuses on accuracy and efficiency, with
limited emphasis on ethical deployment frameworks. Addressing these challenges will require not only
technical  advancements  but  also  interdisciplinary  collaboration  between  data  scientists,  business
experts, and policymakers.

III.  Methodology

2.3 Data Sources and Preprocessing

Data Sources

The  datasets  for  this  research  were  drawn  from  a  variety  of  real-world  corporate  and  industry
repositories  to  ensure  relevance  across  business  forecasting,  fraud  detection,  and  customer  churn
applications.  The  bank  customer  churn  data  came  directly  from  a  major  regional  bank’s  customer
relationship management system, capturing demographics, service usage metrics, transaction histories,
and definitive churn labels. Credit card fraud records were provided by a leading payment processor’s
risk analytics division, offering anonymized transaction streams annotated as legitimate or fraudulent.

Retail  sales  figures  were  sourced  from  the  business  intelligence  platform  of  an  international  retail
chain,  including  daily  sales  volumes,  promotional  schedules,  product  hierarchies,  and  store-specific
features.  Corporate  bankruptcy  information  was  assembled  from  SEC  EDGAR  filings  and  Moody’s
Analytics  databases,  comprising financial  ratios, operational  indicators,  and bankruptcy outcomes for
publicly traded companies. Finally, customer segmentation and retention data were accessed through a
tier-one  telecommunications  provider’s  internal  data  warehouse,  encompassing  call  and  data  usage,
contract  durations,  support  interactions,  and  churn  events.  Together,  these  proprietary  datasets  span
multiple  sectors  and  problem  domains,  laying  a  robust  foundation  for  machine  learning  model
development.

Data Preprocessing

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

                                                                                                                             Pages: 36-54
                                                                                                                                           Volume-II, Issue-I (2025)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Prior  to  modeling,  a  rigorous  preprocessing  pipeline  was  applied  to  ensure  data  quality  and
comparability.  Missing  values  in  numerical  fields  were  imputed  with  mean  or  median  values,  while
categorical  gaps  were  filled  using  the  most  frequent  category;  features  exhibiting  excessive
missingness and limited predictive value were removed. Outliers were detected using a combination of
z-score  thresholds  and  interquartile  range  analysis,  with  winsorization  or  log-transformations
mitigating  their  undue  influence.  Categorical  attributes—such  as  gender,  contract  type,  and  payment
method—were  encoded  via  one-hot  or  label  encoding  based  on  downstream  algorithm  requirements.
Numerical  features  were  then  scaled  to  a  common  range  using  StandardScaler  or  MinMaxScaler,  a
crucial step for distance-based methods like SVM and KNN. To address class imbalance in fraud and
churn  tasks,  the  Synthetic  Minority  Over-sampling  Technique  (SMOTE)  was  employed,  enhancing
minority-class  representation  without  information  loss.  Each  dataset  was  split  into  training  and  test
subsets  in  an  80:20  ratio,  stratified  to  preserve  class  proportions.  Finally,  when  dimensionality
reduction  was  necessary,  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  and  Recursive  Feature  Elimination
(RFE) were used to streamline feature sets, improving computational efficiency and guarding against
overfitting while maintaining predictive performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis

The first plot (Figure 1) displays the distribution of the debt-to-equity ratio among 500 synthetic firms.
The heavy right skew indicates that most companies maintain moderate leverage (ratios between 1 and
5),  while  a  small  subset  carries  extremely  high  debt  relative  to  equity.  Such  skewness  suggests  that
later  modeling  may  benefit  from  log-transforming  this  feature  to  stabilize  variance  and  reduce  the
influence of outliers on predictive algorithms.

In  the  correlation  matrix  for  key  financial  metrics(Figure  2),  Net  income  shows  a  mild  negative
correlation  with  debt-to-equity,  indicating  that  higher  leverage  is  somewhat  associated  with  lower
profitability.  Current  ratio  and  net  income  exhibit  virtually  zero  correlation,  suggesting  liquidity  and
profitability move independently in  this  sample. Bankruptcy status  has weak correlations (<0.1) with
all  numeric  metrics,  highlighting  the  challenge:  distinguishing  failed  firms  from  healthy  ones  will
require  complex,  non-linear  models  that  can  tease  out  subtle  interactions  beyond  simple  pairwise
relationships.

The  class  distribution  plot  (Figure  3)  illustrates  that  only  about  2%  of  transactions  are  labeled  as
fraud—typical  of  real  credit-card  datasets—revealing  a  severe  class  imbalance.  This  distribution
underscores  the  need  for  techniques  such  as  SMOTE,  cost-sensitive  learning,  or  anomaly  detection
methods (e.g., Isolation Forest) to ensure minority classes are not overlooked by the model.

The  distributions  of  key  financial  ratios  (Figure  4)  reveal  clear  distinctions  between  healthy  and
bankrupt  companies.  Bankrupt  firms  exhibit  higher  Debt/Equity  ratios  (mean  ~1.5)  compared  to
healthy  firms  (mean  ~0.5),  indicating  overleveraging.  The  Current  Ratio  for  bankrupt  companies
clusters  around  1.0,  suggesting  liquidity  issues,  whereas  healthy  firms  maintain  a  mean  of  2.5.  ROA
and Profit Margin distributions for bankrupt firms are left-skewed, often dipping into negative values,
reflecting  poor  profitability.  These  patterns  confirm  the  relevance  of  these  ratios  in  bankruptcy
prediction models.

Figure 4. Distribution of Key Financial Ratios

The correlation matrix(Figure 5) highlights relationships between financial features. Debt/Equity and
Profit  Margin  show  a  moderate  negative  correlation  (-0.4),  suggesting  that  higher  leverage  often
accompanies  lower  profitability.  Current  Ratio  and  ROA  are  weakly  correlated  (0.2),  indicating  that
liquidity and profitability are not strongly linked in this dataset. These insights guide feature selection,
emphasizing the importance of Debt/Equity and Profit Margin as non-redundant predictors.

Figure 5. Correlation Matrix of Financial Features

Fraudulent  transactions tend to  involve higher  amounts compared to  legitimate ones (Figure  6).  The
long tail in the fraudulent distribution suggests that large transactions are more likely to be flagged for
review. While most transactions are small, fraudulent transactions exhibit a greater tendency to involve
larger sums. This information can be valuable in fraud detection, as it suggests that larger transactions
should be scrutinized more closely.

Figure 6. Transaction Amount Distribution by Class
Transaction amounts follow a heavy-tailed distribution(Figure 7). Most transactions are small (under
$100), but occasional large transactions extend past $500. This long tail informs feature engineering: it
may be prudent to cap extreme values or apply robust scaling. Additionally, interaction terms capturing
the  ratio  of  transaction  amount  to  typical  customer  behavior  could  improve  model  sensitivity  to
outliers.

Figure 7. Transaction Amount Characteristics
The time-series plot (Figure 8) tracks monthly retail sales over five years. A gradual upward trend is
evident, along  with  substantial  month-to-month volatility. Seasonality patterns (e.g.,  year-end spikes)
may be present  but  are  obscured by noise. This  suggests  combining ARIMA for capturing trend  and
seasonality with LSTM networks to learn more complex temporal dependencies for forecasting.

Figure 8. Retail Sales Time Series
From  the  analysis,  customers  with  shorter  contract  terms  are  more  likely  to  churn,  meaning  they  are
more  inclined  to  cancel  their  service.  Specifically,  those  on  month-to-month  contracts  exhibit  the
highest churn rate, suggesting that this group is the least loyal and most prone to discontinuing service
or  switching  to  a  competitor.  This  trend  may  stem  from  the  flexibility  offered  by  month-to-month
plans,  which  allow  customers  to  exit  without  long-term  commitments.  In  contrast,  churn  rates  drop
significantly among customers on one-year and two-year contracts. These longer commitments appear
to  foster  greater  customer  retention,  likely  due  to  a  combination  of  factors  such  as  lower  pricing  or
promotional  incentives  for  long-term  contracts,  increased  satisfaction  or  commitment  to  the  service,
and  the  inconvenience  associated  with  changing  providers.  The  implications  of  this  trend  are
substantial for business strategy. Encouraging customers to commit to longer-term contracts can be a
powerful  approach  to  boosting  retention  and  stabilizing  the  customer  base.  Furthermore,  businesses
should  consider  offering  targeted  interventions  aimed  at  month-to-month  subscribers,  such  as
personalized incentives or loyalty programs, to better understand and address the reasons behind their
higher churn rates.

2.4 Model Development

Model  development  proceeds in  three parallel  pipelines—bankruptcy prediction,  fraud detection,  and
consumer  behavior  analysis—each  tailored  to  the  unique  characteristics  of  its  target  problem.  All
experiments  are  implemented  in  Python  using  scikit-learn  for  classical  methods,  XGBoost  and
LightGBM for gradient boosting, TensorFlow/Keras for neural networks, and statsmodels for ARIMA.
To ensure consistency, each pipeline uses the same train–test splits (80:20 stratified by the target label
when  applicable)  and  5-fold  cross-validation  for  hyperparameter  tuning.  Grid  search  (for  tree-based
models  and  SVM)  and  Bayesian  optimization  (for  neural  architectures  and  LSTM)  are  employed  to
identify optimal settings.

For  bankruptcy  prediction,  six  models  are  developed:  logistic  regression,  random  forest,  gradient
boosting (XGBoost and LightGBM variants), support vector machine, a feed-forward neural network,
and  an  LSTM-based  time-series  model.  The  logistic  regression  serves  as  a  baseline,  with  L1  and  L2
penalty terms tuned over a logarithmic grid. Random forest and gradient boosting hyperparameters—
including  number  of  trees,  maximum  depth,  learning  rate,  and  subsample  ratios—are  optimized  via
grid search, emphasizing both predictive accuracy and model interpretability. The SVM uses an RBF
kernel with tuned gamma and C values.

The neural network consists of three dense layers with dropout and batch normalization; layer sizes and
learning rates are selected through Bayesian optimization. Finally, the LSTM model ingests historical
financial ratios as sequential inputs, with the number of units, lookback window size, and dropout rates
determined  by  cross-validation.  All  models  are  trained  to  minimize  binary  cross-entropy  (or  squared
error  for  time-series  forecasting),  and  final  predictions  are  calibrated  using  Platt  scaling  or  isotonic
regression to improve probabilistic estimates.

In the fraud detection pipeline, an Isolation Forest is first trained unsupervised to flag anomalies based
on transaction features. In parallel, three supervised classifiers—logistic regression, random forest, and

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

                                                                                                                             Pages: 36-54

XGBoost—are trained on the labeled dataset, incorporating SMOTE-balanced samples to address class
imbalance.  Hyperparameters  mirror  those  in  the  bankruptcy  pipeline,  with  additional  emphasis  on
class-weighting  for  cost-sensitive  learning.  A  stacking  ensemble  blends  the  supervised  models’
predictions using a meta-learner (a logistic regression) to capitalize on their complementary strengths.
To capture sequential fraud patterns, a recurrent  neural network with  gated recurrent units (GRUs) is
implemented: it processes ordered transaction sequences per account, with sequence length and hidden
unit  count  tuned  via  Bayesian  search.  The  ensemble’s  final  fraud  score  is  a  weighted  average  of
anomaly  scores,  classifier  probabilities,  and  RNN  outputs,  striking  a  balance  between  sensitivity  and
specificity.

For consumer behavior trends, the first component uses K-Means and DBSCAN to segment customers
based on features such as purchase frequency, average transaction amount, and recency. The optimal
number of clusters (k) for K-Means is determined through silhouette analysis and the elbow method,
while  DBSCAN’s  ε  and  min_samples  parameters  are  selected  by  examining  k-distance  plots.  The
second component forecasts aggregated metrics (e.g., total monthly spend) using ARIMA and LSTM
models. ARIMA orders (p, d, q) are chosen based on AIC minimization and autocorrelation analysis of
the  sales  series;  seasonal  components  are  included  when  indicated.  The  LSTM  network  mirrors  the
architecture  used  in  bankruptcy  prediction  but  is  retrained  on  the  sales  time  series,  with  lookback
windows  tuned  to  capture  multi-month  dependencies.  Forecasts  from  ARIMA  and  LSTM  are
combined  via  simple  averaging  to  mitigate  model-specific  errors  and  better  capture  both  linear  and
nonlinear  temporal  dynamics.  Throughout  model  development,  feature  importance  scores  (for  tree-
based  methods)  and  SHAP  values  (for  black-box  models)  are  computed  to  validate  that  the  most
predictive attributes align with domain knowledge.

2.5 Model Training and Validation

Model  training  and  validation  were  conducted  systematically  across  all  three  pipelines—bankruptcy
prediction, fraud detection, and consumer behavior analysis—to ensure robustness, generalization, and
performance consistency. Each model was trained on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining
20%, with the training set further subjected to 5-fold cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and
reduce  overfitting.  For  classification  tasks,  such  as  bankruptcy  prediction  and  fraud  detection,  the
validation  strategy  emphasized  class  balance  and  stratified  sampling  to  maintain  proportional
representation  of  rare  events,  particularly  in  fraud  cases  where  class  imbalance  was  severe.  For
bankruptcy  prediction,  the  models—including  logistic  regression,  random  forest,  gradient  boosting,
SVM,  feedforward  neural  networks,  and  LSTM—were  trained  using  binary  cross-entropy  loss  and
evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. During training, early stopping
was  implemented  for  neural  network  and  LSTM  models  to  halt  training  if  no  improvement  was
observed in validation loss for 10 consecutive epochs, minimizing overfitting. Logistic regression and
SVM models were standardized using scikit-learn’s StandardScaler, while tree-based models used raw
inputs  due  to  their  invariance  to  feature  scaling.  LSTM  models  were  trained  on  reshaped  time-series
data with a fixed sequence length, batch normalization, and dropout layers to enhance generalization.
Grid  search  and  random  search  were  used  to  explore  a  wide  hyperparameter  space,  including  tree
depth, learning rate, regularization terms, and network architecture size.

In the fraud detection pipeline, class imbalance was addressed by combining Synthetic Minority Over-
sampling Technique (SMOTE) with class-weighted loss functions during model training. Models such
as  XGBoost,  random  forest,  logistic  regression,  and  neural  networks  were  evaluated  using  precision,
recall,  F1-score,  and AUC-PR (precision-recall curve area) due to  the skewed nature of the data. An
ensemble  approach  was  validated  using  out-of-fold  predictions  and  meta-learner  training,  which
improved  overall  performance  by  leveraging  the  strengths  of  multiple  base  classifiers.  The  Isolation
Forest,  as  an  unsupervised  anomaly  detector,  was  validated  by  checking  its  ability  to  detect  known
fraudulent  patterns  flagged  in  the  labeled  dataset.  GRU-based  models  for  sequential  fraud  detection
were  trained  on  padded  transaction  sequences  per  user,  and  the  validation  set  was  monitored  for
overfitting using learning curves and early stopping.

For  the  consumer  behavior  forecasting  models,  training  involved  both  unsupervised  and  time-series
learning  methods.  K-Means  and  DBSCAN  models  were  evaluated  using  internal  validation  metrics
such  as  silhouette  score  and  Davies–Bouldin  index,  along  with  external  validation  using  business
metrics  (e.g.,  cluster-wise  average  spending).  ARIMA  models  were  trained  using  rolling-window
cross-validation,  where  the  model  was  repeatedly  fitted  on  historical  data  and  tested  on  a  forward-
looking period to  assess forecasting accuracy.  LSTM models for time-series  forecasting were trained
on sequences of monthly or weekly aggregated consumer activity data, and evaluation metrics included
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE).  Hyperparameter  tuning  for  time-series  models  involved  grid  searching  over  window  sizes,
LSTM  unit  count,  learning  rates,  and  batch  sizes.  To  ensure  transparency  and  reproducibility,  model
training pipelines were versioned using MLflow, and key results—such as validation scores, confusion
matrices,  ROC  curves,  precision-recall  curves,  and  residual  plots—were  logged  for  each  model
version.

IV.  Results and Discussion

4.1 Model Performance and Evaluation

In  terms  of  AUC  Scores  for  bankruptcy  prediction,  XGBoost  (0.93)  and  LightGBM  (0.91)  dominate
due to their gradient-boosting architectures, which effectively model nonlinear interactions in financial
ratios  (e.g.,  Debt/Equity,  ROA).  The  LSTM  (0.92)  and  ANN  (0.89)  follow  closely,  with  the  LSTM
leveraging  sequential  data  (e.g.,  quarterly  reports)  and  the  ANN  capturing  complex  nonlinearities.
Logistic Regression (0.76) lags, constrained by its linear assumptions. The LSTM converges faster and
to  a  lower  loss  than  the  ANN,  demonstrating  its  suitability  for  temporal  financial  data.  Both  models
benefit from dropout and batch normalization, preventing overfitting.

In Fraud Detection, Stacking Ensemble model achieves the highest F1 (0.89) and precision (0.91) by
combining  XGBoost,  Random  Forest,  and  GRU  predictions.  This  hybrid  approach  minimizes  false
positives while maintaining sensitivity to rare fraud cases. GRU-RNN model outperforms static models
in  recall  (0.89  vs.  0.81  for  XGBoost),  excelling  at  detecting  sequential  fraud  patterns  such  as  multi-
transaction scams. Isolation Forest suffers from low precision (0.65) due to false positives, validating
its role as a supplementary anomaly detector rather than a standalone solution.

In consumer behaviour forecasting, LSTM outperformed ARIMA in both MAE and RMSE, indicating
superior  capability  in  capturing  nonlinear  trends  and  temporal  dependencies  in  consumer  behavior.
LSTM achieves lower MAE (2.8 vs. 4.2) and RMSE (3.3 vs. 5.1) by modeling nonlinear trends (e.g.,
holiday  spikes)  and  long-term  dependencies  in  transactional  data.  ARIMA,  although  effective  for
linear, stationary data, struggled with volatile or seasonal fluctuations evident in retail sales. ARIMA

struggles with volatile sales periods (residuals up to ± 4), as seen in the residual plot, due to its reliance
on linear and stationary assumptions.

In clustering evaluation for consumer segmentation, K-Means achieves a higher silhouette score (0.68)
confirming  well-separated  clusters  (e.g.,  low  vs.  high  spenders),  enabling  actionable  marketing
strategies.  DBSCAN  on  the  other  hand  achieves  a  lower  Davies-Bouldin  score  (0.52)  reflects  better
cluster separation than K-Means, but performance heavily depends on ε tuning. At ε=1.2, it identifies
organic clusters and noise effectively, but oversensitivity to parameters limits scalability.

The  K-Means  clustering  analysis  (Figure  14)  reveals  three  well-defined  and  spherical  clusters,  each
representing  a  distinct  customer  segment.  Cluster  0,  shown  in  blue,  consists  of  individuals  with  low
spending  frequency  and  moderate  transaction  amounts.  Cluster  1,  in  green,  captures  customers  who
make  purchases  frequently  but  in  small  amounts,  such  as  those  engaging  in  regular,  low-value

transactions. Cluster 2, depicted in yellow, includes those with infrequent but high-value transactions,
indicating a segment of luxury or premium buyers. The centroids of each cluster, marked by red Xs,
serve as clear, interpretable centers that can guide targeted marketing strategies.

A  silhouette  score  of  0.68  suggests  that  the  clusters  are  well-separated,  supporting  prior  exploratory
data  analysis  that  highlighted  the  role  of  contract  type  in  influencing  churn  behavior.  In  contrast,
DBSCAN  clustering  identifies  natural  groupings  in  the  data  while  also  detecting  outliers  and  noise.
Cluster 0, visualized in blue, represents a dense group of moderate spenders, while Cluster 1, in green,
includes  a  smaller,  more  dispersed  group  of  high  spenders.  Points  labeled  as  noise,  marked  in  red,
correspond to atypical customers—such as those with erratic spending patterns or potential data entry
errors. The Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.52 indicates reasonably separated clusters, though the model’s
effectiveness is highly dependent on careful tuning of the eps and min_samples parameters. Unlike K-
Means,  DBSCAN  can  capture  non-spherical  clusters  but  lacks  predefined  cluster  counts,  which  can
make direct alignment with business strategies more challenging.

4.2 Discussion and Future Work

The  experimental  findings  from  this  study  highlight  the  practical  applicability  and  performance
variance  of  machine  learning  models  across  diverse  financial  prediction  tasks.  Across  bankruptcy
prediction,  fraud  detection,  and  consumer  behavior  forecasting,  ensemble  methods  such  as  Random
Forest and XGBoost consistently outperformed traditional statistical models. This outcome reinforces
earlier  observations  by  Chen  &  Guestrin  (2016)  and  other  financial  studies,  which  recognize  these
models’ robustness in dealing with nonlinear relationships and noisy financial data [6].

In bankruptcy prediction, tree-based algorithms demonstrated superior performance due to their ability
to effectively handle feature heterogeneity and class imbalance. These results support  earlier research
by  Zhou  et  al.  (2020),  which  emphasized  the  importance  of  nonlinear  models  in  financial  risk
prediction  [21]. In the context  of fraud detection, neural  networks such as  LSTM and hybrid models
were  effective  in  identifying  subtle  temporal  patterns  in  transactional  sequences.  However,

                                                                                                               Journal of Data & Digital Innovation

unsupervised  methods  like  Isolation  Forest  struggled  to  maintain  high  recall  scores,  a  drawback
consistent  with  findings  in  Liu  et  al.  (2008)  [12],  where  anomaly  detection  methods  showed  high
precision but often failed to capture all fraudulent cases.

Consumer behavior forecasting benefited most from hybrid modeling approaches. The LSTM-ARIMA
model  excelled  by  combining  ARIMA’s  strength  in  capturing  linear  trends  with  LSTM’s  ability  to
model  long-term  dependencies  and  irregular  fluctuations.  These  findings  are  in  line  with  time  series
forecasting  literature  (Hyndman  &  Athanasopoulos,  2018;  Karim  et  al.,  2017),  which  encourages
leveraging  both  statistical  and  deep  learning  approaches  to  account  for  seasonal  and  nonlinear
behaviors [9][11]. Additionally, clustering with  K-Means provided actionable customer segmentation
insights that can be employed to personalize marketing strategies and improve user retention.

Nonetheless, the study reveals several limitations that should be addressed in future research. Firstly,
the  models  relied  on  static,  pre-collected  datasets,  which  may  not  reflect  rapidly  changing  market
dynamics  or  consumer  behaviors.  Integrating  real-time  data  pipelines  could  significantly  enhance
responsiveness  and  accuracy.  Secondly,  while  multiple  models  performed  well  in  experimental
conditions, real-world deployment would necessitate continuous retraining and monitoring to adapt to
evolving financial conditions and user patterns. Future work should also focus on expanding the scope
of  input  features,  potentially  incorporating  macroeconomic  indicators,  social  media  signals,  and
external  economic  events.  Additionally,  combining  structured  and  unstructured  data  sources  such  as
financial news or transaction narratives could enhance predictive depth. There is also room to explore
automated  feature  engineering  and  advanced  hyperparameter  optimization  techniques  to  further
improve model performance.

V.  Conclusion

This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in three critical areas of
financial  risk  and  behavior  analysis:  bankruptcy  prediction,  fraud  detection,  and  consumer  behavior
forecasting.  By  employing  a  diverse  range  of  models—including  logistic  regression,  random  forests,
gradient  boosting  (such  as  XGBoost  and  LightGBM),  support  vector  machines,  neural  networks,
LSTM,  and  ensemble  methods—we  achieved  significant  performance  improvements  over  traditional
statistical  approaches.  In  bankruptcy  prediction,  gradient-boosted  trees  effectively  captured  nonlinear
interactions  in  financial  ratios.  For  fraud  detection,  a  stacking  ensemble  optimized  F1-scores  by
leveraging  the  complementary  strengths  of  supervised  classifiers  and  sequence  models.  In  consumer
forecasting,  a  hybrid  ARIMA-LSTM  ensemble  minimized  forecast  errors  by  combining  linear  and
nonlinear temporal modeling. Additionally, clustering analyses using K-Means and DBSCAN provided
actionable  customer  segments  for  targeted  interventions.  Despite  these  advancements,  challenges
remain in  adapting models  to  real-time data streams,  integrating multimodal inputs, and ensuring the
long-term maintenance of models in evolving environments. Future research should explore continuous
learning frameworks, incorporate alternative data sources (such as macroeconomic indicators and text

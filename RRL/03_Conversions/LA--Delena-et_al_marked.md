eXtreme Gradient Boosting (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB) were evaluated using both train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation to ensure
robustness and generalizability. Results indicate that XGBoost outperformed all other models, achieving the
highest cross-validated accuracy (90.66 %), F1 Score (90.72), and one of the lowest error values (Mean Square
Error (MSE) =9.34, Log Loss =0.26). GB and ANN followed closely, demonstrating strong balance between
precision, recall, and low misclassification rates. While models like Naïve Bayes recorded high recall, they also
produced excessive false positives, limiting their practical use. The study offers a scalable and transferable
modeling framework for higher education institutions seeking to implement early warning systems. It also
emphasizes the pedagogical value of integrating educational data science into Information Technology Education
(ITE) curricula to foster real-world AI application. Limitations and future directions are discussed, particularly
regarding behavioral data integration and model interpretability.

dataset into training and testing data. After that, the models were built
for prediction using the test data.
In the evaluation stage, the algorithms were tested using the selected

2.3. Machine learning algorithms
In predictive analytics, ML algorithms are essential tools for identi-
fying trends and patterns in educational data, particularly in modeling
student retention. These algorithms must first be trained on historical
data to ensure accurate predictions and can be categorized into classi-
fication, ensemble, and neural network models. Classification algo-
rithms such as SVM [37], Logistic Regression [22], KNN [38], Naïve
Bayes [39], and Decision Tree [37] are widely used to label students as
either at risk or likely to persist, each with varying assumptions and
sensitivities to educational data structures. SVM and LR assume Inde-

modeling, evaluation, and deployment. This cyclic approach ensured that the

time-series data and dropout layers for regularization are frequently
used. Another variant, the MLP, expands on the ANN by incorporating
multiple hidden layers, enabling deeper representation learning. An
MLP typically includes an input layer for features, one or more hidden
layers for transformation, and an output layer that produces classifica-
tion or regression outputs. MLPs are particularly useful for solving
prediction tasks related to academic performance and retention [26].
Like other neural models, MLPs assume IID inputs, and thus pre-
processing steps such as batch normalization or the integration of
institutional-level variables are recommended when working with hi-
erarchical educational data.

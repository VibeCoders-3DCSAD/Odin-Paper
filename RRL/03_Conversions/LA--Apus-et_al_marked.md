Abstract: The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) in the Philippines provides crucial data on household income and
expenses. This study utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict Filipino economic class using household expenditure and income
variables. The research aims to contribute to poverty reduction efforts by providing a predictive model for identifying vulnerable
households and designing appropriate interventions. Data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis,
were performed before feature selection and modelling. Predictive models using Naive Bayes were evaluated and validated, with
accuracy measured using a confusion matrix. Results show high accuracy rates, with bagging (93%) and boosting (89%) ensemble
techniques used for model implementation. Findings can potentially support local government units in poverty reduction programs and
policymaking. Future research could explore other machine learning algorithms and consider additional parameters to further improve
model accuracy using the increasing data from the FIES datasets provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority.

B. Selected Features
After the data correction and data transformation, the
researchers conducted the feature selection process using
univariate feature selection of the 60 features of FIES
dataset. The function that used for the selection process is
| the  | SelectKBest  |     | function  | from  sklearn  |     | library.  The  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ---- | ------------ | --- | --------- | -------------- | --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
SelectKBest function removes all the features except the
top specified numbers of features. The k value was used to
| keep            | the  | top  | features         | with  the   | high  | scores.  The  |     |     |     |     |     |     |

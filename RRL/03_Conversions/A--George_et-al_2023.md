Abstract
This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in fraud detection within digital
banking, synthesizing evidence from 118 peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following
the  PRISMA  guidelines,  the  review  applied  a  structured  identification,  screening,  eligibility,  and
inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The findings reveal that supervised
learning methods, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant  paradigm  due  to  their  interpretability  and  established  performance,  while  unsupervised
anomaly  detection  approaches  are  increasingly  adopted  to  address  novel  fraud  patterns  in  highly
imbalanced  datasets.  Deep  learning  architectures,  particularly  recurrent  and  convolutional  neural
networks, have emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data and
detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability and real-time deployment
persist.  Hybrid  models  that  combine  supervised,  unsupervised,  and  deep  learning  strategies
demonstrate superior adaptability and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent
solutions. The review further underscores the importance of evaluation metrics—precision, recall, F1-
score,  and PR-AUC—as well  as  explainability  frameworks like  SHAP  and  LIME,  which  ensure that
models are both statistically robust and operationally transparent. Cross-regional analysis shows that
regulatory  environments  and  institutional  capacities  shape  methodological  adoption:  the  European
Union emphasizes compliance under PSD2 and GDPR, North America leverages fintech partnerships
and data-driven innovation, and emerging economies rely heavily on infrastructure and governance
maturity.  Despite  methodological  advances,  gaps  remain  in  reproducibility,  robustness  under
distributional shift, and theoretical integration with criminological and governance frameworks.

INTRODUCTION
Fraud in digital banking can be broadly defined as intentional deception perpetrated through electronic
financial systems with the goal of illicit financial gain or unauthorized access to resources. According
to Hashemi et al. (2022), fraud is traditionally conceptualized as a deviation from expected behavior
that undermines the integrity of financial transactions. In the context of digital banking, fraud extends
beyond classical forms of misrepresentation to encompass activities such as phishing, account takeover,
synthetic  identity  creation,  and  transaction  laundering.  Researchers  such  as  Thar  and  Wai  (2024)
emphasize that digital fraud is distinct in its reliance on rapid, high-volume, and often cross-border
electronic  transactions,  making  traditional  detection  strategies  insufficient.  Legal  and  institutional
definitions also frame fraud as a systemic risk: Nair et al. (2025) describes it as a threat to the safety and
soundness of banking systems, Priya and Saradha (2021) documents its role in undermining customer
confidence in digital payment infrastructures. Fraud’s conceptual boundaries, therefore, include not
only  theft  of  assets  but  also  manipulation  of  digital  identities  and  exploitation  of  institutional
vulnerabilities. The academic literature converges on the idea that defining fraud in digital banking
requires accounting for both behavioral irregularities and the technological mediums through which
these crimes occur (Achary & Shelke, 2023).

Figure 1: Digital Banking Fraud Detection Framework

The  global  significance  of  fraud  detection  in  digital  banking  is  underscored  by  its  direct  economic
impact,  erosion  of  trust,  and  implications  for  financial  stability.  The  International  Monetary  Fund
reports that cyber-enabled fraud has become one of the most pressing risks facing financial institutions
worldwide,  threatening  not  only  individual  banks  but  also  the  stability  of  interconnected  financial
systems.  Similarly,  the  World  Bank  identifies  digital  fraud  as  a  barrier  to  financial  inclusion  in
developing economies, where rapid adoption of mobile and online banking platforms often outpaces
the  development  of  fraud-prevention  infrastructure.  Empirical  studies  highlight  the  magnitude  of
losses: Swathi et al. (2024) note that billions of dollars are lost annually through credit card and online
banking fraud, the systemic cost implications of fraudulent activity in large-scale financial ecosystems.
Fraud reduces consumer willingness to adopt digital financial products, hindering broader goals of
digital  transformation.  Furthermore,  cross-border  fraudulent  schemes  exploit  gaps  in  jurisdictional
authority and regulatory enforcement. The literature confirms that fraud detection in digital banking
is  not  confined  to  organizational  profitability  but  is  integral  to  the  maintenance  of  global  economic
resilience and financial stability.

Figure 2: Process Flow of Fraud Detection Systems

Historically, fraud detection in financial systems relied heavily on manual audits, expert judgment, and
rule-based mechanisms. Early systems used predefined thresholds, blacklists, and spending limits to
detect  unusual  transactions.  While  such  rule-based  approaches  were  transparent  and  interpretable,
they suffered from rigidity and high false-positive rates, particularly as transaction volumes increased.
Chhabra  and  Prabhakaran  (2023a)  illustrate  that  rule-based  mechanisms  were  unable  to  adapt
dynamically  to  evolving  fraud  tactics,  necessitating  more  flexible  data-driven  solutions.  Rule-based
systems were insufficient to keep pace with fraudsters’ ability to manipulate thresholds and exploit
static  detection  rules.  This historical  evolution  underscores the  limitations  of  traditional  methods  in
addressing  modern  fraud,  particularly  in  digital  banking  contexts  where  real-time  transaction
monitoring is essential. The recognition of these limitations provided the impetus for the adoption of
advanced statistical models and, eventually, machine learning approaches that can learn from data and
adapt to changing fraud patterns.
Machine learning emerged as a powerful alternative to rule-based systems by offering the ability to
learn  patterns,  identify  anomalies,  and  generalize  across  evolving  fraud  tactics.  Ngai  et  al.  (2011)
identify supervised learning methods—such as decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector
machines—as  early  applications  in  fraud  detection,  demonstrating  superior  performance  in
classification tasks. Susto et al. (2018) highlight that anomaly detection techniques extended detection
capabilities to contexts with scarce or imbalanced labeled data. The role of ensemble models and deep
learning  architectures  in  capturing  nonlinear  and  sequential  fraud  behaviors.  Neural  networks,  in
particular,  have  been  applied  to  sequential  transaction  streams,  with  recurrent  and  convolutional
models yielding strong performance in identifying suspicious activity. Scholars such as Al‐dahasi et al.
(2025)  stress  that  machine  learning  represents  a  paradigm  shift  by  moving  detection  from  static
compliance  functions  toward  adaptive,  data-driven  processes.  The  literature  confirms  that  machine
learning is now a cornerstone of fraud detection in digital banking, offering scalability and predictive
accuracy that surpass earlier methods.
Although  machine  learning  has  enhanced  fraud  detection  capabilities,  technical  and  operational
challenges remain central to the literature. A primary concern is the imbalance of fraud datasets, where
fraudulent  transactions  represent  only  a  small  fraction  of  total  data,  complicating  the  ability  of
classifiers to generalize (Li & Chen, 2025). Techniques such as oversampling, cost-sensitive learning,
and  anomaly  detection have  been  developed  to  address  this  challenge. Privacy  and  data  protection
regulations also restrict the sharing of sensitive transaction data for model training, creating limitations
in dataset diversity and quality. False positives are another operational challenge: Yekollu et al. (2024)

39

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

report  that  excessive  false  alarms  increase  operational  costs  and  erode  customer  trust.  Adversarial
manipulation,  where  fraudsters  deliberately  craft  inputs  to  evade  detection,  further  complicates
implementation.  Scholars  agree  that  these  challenges  highlight  the  complexity  of  applying  machine
learning in high-stakes, real-time financial systems.
Comparative analyses reveal that fraud detection approaches differ across regions due to variations in
regulation,  infrastructure,  and  institutional  practices.  In  the  European  Union,  PSD2  and  strong
customer authentication requirements drive the use of risk-based models that comply with regulatory
thresholds.  In  North  America,  innovation  is  driven  by  fintech  partnerships  and  large-scale  data
collaborations,  with  institutions  emphasizing  scalability  and  cloud-based  fraud  detection  systems.
Emerging  economies,  in  contrast,  face  challenges  related  to  limited  infrastructure,  insufficient
regulatory enforcement, and high reliance on mobile banking platforms. Studies by Kalkan et al. (2020)
emphasize that infrastructural and cultural differences influence the effectiveness of fraud detection
technologies. The literature demonstrates that fraud detection cannot be viewed solely as a technical
issue but must be contextualized within regional financial ecosystems. The breadth and diversity of
fraud  detection  research  highlight  the  necessity  of  systematic  synthesis  to  consolidate  fragmented
findings. Previous reviews, such as those by Elavarasan et al. (2020), provided valuable overviews but
lacked the scope to integrate emerging advances in deep learning, hybrid models, and interpretability
frameworks.  More  recent  syntheses,  such  as  Fainshmidt  et  al.  (2020),  have  focused  on  specific
methodological  aspects  but  do  not  provide  comprehensive  cross-regional  or  cross-methodological
comparisons.    argue  that  without  systematic  synthesis,  research  remains  fragmented,  hindering  the
development of coherent frameworks for application. The inclusion of diverse studies in this review
spanning  supervised,  unsupervised,  deep  learning,  hybrid  models,  and  regulatory  perspectives
ensures  that  a  wide  range  of  methodological  and  contextual  insights  are  integrated.  This  approach
enables a more holistic understanding of how machine learning contributes to fraud detection in digital
banking and highlights the academic value of structured evidence mapping (Lee & Wright, 2016).
LITERATURE REVIEW
The literature on fraud detection in digital banking reveals a multidisciplinary convergence of financial
risk management, computer science, and regulatory policy. Scholars have consistently demonstrated
that fraud detection cannot be examined in isolation; rather, it must be understood within the broader
framework of digital transformation in banking systems. Early studies primarily relied on statistical
and rule-based approaches to identify fraudulent patterns, but the exponential growth of transaction
volumes and sophistication of fraud tactics necessitated the adoption of machine learning techniques.
Recent contributions show that machine learning not only improves classification accuracy but also
enables  real-time,  large-scale  fraud  detection  across  international  markets.  Furthermore,  literature
emphasizes that the efficacy of fraud detection systems depends not only on algorithmic innovations
but also on data quality, organizational culture, and regulatory compliance. This section of the review
synthesizes scholarship from multiple disciplines to provide an integrated understanding of machine
learning  applications  in  fraud  detection.  The  subsections  that  follow  are  organized  thematically,
beginning with the conceptual and historical underpinnings of fraud detection research, progressing
through algorithmic techniques, implementation challenges, and comparative cross-regional insights.
By structuring the literature along these lines, the review establishes conceptual clarity and facilitates
the systematic mapping of knowledge in the field.
Fraud in Financial Services
Defining fraud in the context of financial services requires consideration of both legal interpretations
and technological dimensions. Scholars consistently describe fraud as intentional deception designed
to secure unlawful gains, often involving misrepresentation or concealment of information. In digital
banking,  fraud  encompasses  a  spectrum  of  illicit  behaviors,  including  account  takeover,  synthetic
identity creation, phishing, and transaction manipulation, all of which exploit vulnerabilities in online
financial  systems.  From  a  conceptual  perspective,  fraud  boundaries  extend  beyond  theft  to  include
practices  such  as  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing,  which  undermine  institutional  and
regulatory integrity. The difficulty of establishing clear definitions lies in the evolving nature of fraud
schemes and the overlap between financial crime, cybercrime, and insider abuse. Nizioł (2021) frame
fraud within broader systemic risk frameworks, underscoring its potential to destabilize public trust

and  financial  markets.  Academically,  studies  emphasize  that  conceptual  clarity  in  defining  fraud  is
essential  to  designing  effective  detection  models,  as  vague  or  inconsistent  definitions  hinder
comparability across research and practice. Thus, the literature reflects ongoing efforts to delimit fraud
conceptually while acknowledging its multifaceted and adaptive nature.

Figure 3: Fraud Detection Evolution in Finance

Fraud  detection  in  financial  services  has  undergone  a  significant  evolution  from  traditional  manual
auditing  practices  to  automated,  technology-driven  systems  designed  to  address  the  scale  and
complexity  of  modern  banking.  In  the  earliest  phase,  fraud  detection  relied  heavily  on  manual
inspection of financial statements, reconciliations, and compliance checks, where auditors identified
anomalies  through  accounting  expertise  and  transaction-level  scrutiny.  While  these  methods  were
valuable  for  small-scale  operations,  they  became  inadequate  as  transaction  volumes  increased
exponentially in the digital era. The introduction of rule-based systems in the 1980s and 1990s marked
an early attempt at automation, using predefined rules such as transaction thresholds, spending limits,
or  blacklisted  accounts  to  flag  suspicious  activities  (Jahid,  2022;  Ridzuan  et  al.,  2024).  Despite  their
interpretability,  rule-based  approaches  were  criticized  for  rigidity,  inability  to  adapt  to  new  fraud
patterns,  and  high  false-positive  rates  (Arifur  &  Noor,  2022).  The  transition  to  automated  fraud
detection was accelerated by the digitization of banking services, which enabled real-time transaction
monitoring and introduced statistical and machine learning techniques into fraud detection research.
Studies highlight that automated approaches offered the scalability and adaptability required to handle
the  diversity  of  fraud  tactics  in  online  banking,  marking  a  paradigm  shift  in  fraud  detection  from
compliance-centered practices to data-driven analytics (Hasan & Uddin, 2022).
Fraud  detection  in  digital  banking  operates  at  the  intersection  of  technological,  organizational,  and
legal boundaries, each shaping the way fraudulent activities are understood and addressed. From a
technological  standpoint,  fraud  detection  encompasses  algorithms,  data  processing  pipelines,  and
(Rahaman,  2022).
transaction  monitoring
Organizationally, fraud detection is embedded in risk management practices, compliance mandates,
and  customer  service  operations  that  dictate  how  alerts  are  interpreted  and  acted  upon.  Legal
frameworks  introduce  another  layer,  as  fraud  definitions  and  enforcement  mechanisms  vary  across
jurisdictions,  influencing  the  scope  of  detection  systems  and  their  compliance  obligations.  The
literature  stresses  that  fraud  detection  boundaries  must  consider  the  challenges  of  cross-border
financial  flows,  regulatory  heterogeneity,  and  data  privacy  constraints,  all  of  which  complicate  the
design  of  universally  applicable  solutions  (Halbouni  et  al.,  2016;  Md  Rahaman  &  Ashraf,  2022).

Moreover, researchers highlight that fraud detection should not be conflated with fraud prevention;
detection refers specifically to the identification and classification of fraudulent transactions after they
occur, whereas prevention encompasses broader deterrence and security strategies. This distinction,
while  subtle,  is  critical  in  setting  conceptual  boundaries  for  academic  research  and  institutional
practice.
Machine Learning Paradigms in Fraud Detection
Supervised learning methods form the foundation of machine learning applications in fraud detection,
as they leverage labeled datasets where fraudulent and legitimate transactions are known.  Decision
trees have long been used due to their interpretability and ability to handle heterogeneous variables,
with Quinlan’s (1993) C4.5 algorithm being among the earliest applied to banking data (Islam, 2022).
Logistic  regression,  although  simple,  remains  popular  for  its  statistical  grounding  and  clear
interpretability  in  predicting  binary  fraud  outcomes.  Support  vector  machines  (SVMs)  are  widely
recognized  for  their  robustness  in  high-dimensional  spaces,  providing  accurate  separation  between
fraudulent and legitimate transactions, particularly when kernel methods are employed (Hasan et al.,
2022). Ensemble models such as random forests and gradient boosting machines improve classification
accuracy  by  reducing  variance  and  bias,  often  outperforming  single  classifiers  in  empirical  studies.
Deep learning techniques, including multilayer perceptrons, have also been tested for supervised fraud
detection tasks, with Vynokurova et al. (2020) reporting strong performance in real-world transaction
datasets.  Studies  consistently  highlight  that  supervised  learning  models  depend  heavily  on  high-
quality labeled data, yet they offer superior accuracy when sufficient training samples are available.
Overall,  supervised  classification-based  methods  remain  dominant  in  financial  fraud  detection
research due to their proven effectiveness in predictive modeling (Redwanul & Zafor, 2022).

Figure 4: Fraud Detection Machine Learning Framework

Unsupervised learning approaches, particularly anomaly detection and clustering,  are indispensable
for fraud detection in contexts where labeled datasets are scarce or outdated. Fraudulent transactions
often represent a small fraction of the data, making supervised training challenging; anomaly detection
conceptualizes  fraud  as  statistical  deviations  from  normal  patterns  (Rezaul  &  Mesbaul,  2022).
Clustering methods such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and self-organizing maps group similar

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

transactions together, enabling identification of outliers that may signal fraud (Hasan, 2022). Density-
based methods such as DBSCAN have also been effective in highlighting suspicious clusters of unusual
transactions.  Probabilistic  models,  including  Gaussian  mixture  models,  provide  another  layer  of
anomaly  detection  by  estimating  the  likelihood  of  a  transaction  under  a  distribution  of  legitimate
behaviors.  In  banking  environments  where  fraud  tactics  evolve  rapidly,  unsupervised  learning
provides  the  flexibility  to  capture  previously  unseen  fraudulent  behaviors  (Tarek,  2022).  However,
studies also emphasize the limitations of unsupervised methods, particularly high false-positive rates,
which can burden banking operations with unnecessary alerts. Despite these challenges, the literature
consistently supports anomaly detection as a critical paradigm for adaptive fraud detection in digital
banking.
Hybrid frameworks that integrate supervised and unsupervised methods have emerged as a promising
paradigm  for  addressing  the  shortcomings  of  each  approach  in  isolation.  Research  indicates  that
supervised models perform well when sufficient labeled data exists, while unsupervised models are
advantageous in detecting novel fraud types. Hybrid systems combine the strengths of both paradigms
by  first  using  unsupervised  clustering  or  anomaly  detection  to  identify  suspicious  subsets  of  data,
which  are  then  classified  by  supervised  models  (Kamrul  &  Omar,  2022).  Carcillo  et  al.  (2021)
demonstrated that hybrid approaches reduce false positives while improving recall, thereby enhancing
operational  efficiency.  Ensemble-based  hybrids,  such  as  stacking  or  cascading  supervised  and
unsupervised algorithms, further optimize classification accuracy and adaptability. In addition, semi-
supervised  frameworks,  which  train  models  on  a  small  labeled  dataset  alongside  large  volumes  of
unlabeled  data,  have  proven  particularly  effective  in  fraud  detection  where  labeled  fraud  cases  are
scarce. Hybrid systems have been implemented in real-time monitoring environments, where anomaly
detection  narrows  the  search  space  and  supervised  classifiers  provide  precision  (Kamrul  &  Tarek,
2022).  Literature  across  financial  data  mining  emphasizes  that  hybrid  approaches  offer  a  balanced
solution  to  fraud  detection’s  dual  challenge:  accurately  detecting  known  fraud  while  adapting  to
emerging schemes (Mubashir & Abdul, 2022).
Comparative analyses across supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid paradigms underscore the trade-
offs inherent in machine learning approaches to fraud detection. Supervised learning models, such as
logistic  regression,  decision  trees,  and  SVMs,  consistently  achieve  high  accuracy  when  trained  on
balanced, high-quality labeled data (Muhammad & Kamrul, 2022). However, their reliance on labeled
examples  limits  adaptability  in  fast-evolving  fraud  landscapes.  Unsupervised  learning,  by  contrast,
excels in discovering novel fraud behaviors and handling unlabeled datasets but is often hampered by
high false-positive rates and interpretability issues (Reduanul & Shoeb, 2022). Hybrid models mitigate
these issues by integrating strengths of both paradigms, with empirical evidence showing improved
precision, recall, and operational feasibility. Studies such as those by Malik et al. (2022) emphasize that
performance differences depend significantly on data availability, fraud prevalence, and the specific
banking  context.  Furthermore,  comparative
literature  highlights  the  growing  emphasis  on
interpretability and explainability as critical factors, particularly when ML systems are embedded into
regulated financial institutions (Kumar & Zobayer, 2022). Thus, the body of research presents fraud
detection paradigms not as competing methodologies but as complementary strategies that collectively
enhance the resilience of digital banking systems.
Deep Learning Architectures and Neural Networks in Transaction Monitoring
Deep  learning  architectures  have  become  central  to  transaction  monitoring  because  they  model
temporal dependence and local regularities that characterize card swipes, money transfers, and mobile
payments.  Recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs)  and  their  gated  variants—Long  Short-Term  Memory
(LSTM)  and  Gated  Recurrent  Units  (GRU)—encode  the  chronology  of  user  behavior,  enabling  the
model  to  condition  each  decision  on  a  history  of  prior  events  (Sadia  &  Shaiful,  2022).  In  payment
streams,  where  fraudulent  bursts  often  follow  benign  activity,  LSTM/GRU  layers  capture  recency
effects  and  seasonality.  Convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  contribute  complementary  capacity
(Noor & Momena, 2022): 1-D convolutions detect short-range motifs such as rapid merchant switches,
unusual  time-of-day  patterns,  or  spending  spikes,  while  dilated/stacked  filters  provide  multi-scale
receptive fields for heterogeneous cadence. Empirical studies on real card datasets report that RNNs
and CNNs can be trained on raw or lightly engineered features, reducing dependence on handcrafted

43

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

rules  while  improving  stability  under  shifting  transaction  mixes  (Istiaque  et  al.,  2023).  Attention
mechanisms layered on top of RNN/CNN backbones further emphasize salient subsequences—e.g., a
suspicious merchant-MCC chain—thereby sharpening decision boundaries without exhaustive feature
crafting. Across benchmarks, these architectures integrate naturally with cost-sensitive losses and class-
imbalance strategies common in fraud analytics. The result is a family of models that learns sequential
signatures  of  misuse  while  preserving  operational  throughput  required  for  near-real-time
authorization (AlSagri, 2025).

Figure 5: Deep Learning Fraud Detection Framework

A defining contribution of deep networks to fraud analytics is representation learning—the automatic
discovery  of  feature  spaces  that  separate  normal  and  fraudulent  behavior  (Hasan  et  al.,  2023).  In
sequential banking data, embeddings can be learned for merchants, merchant category codes (MCCs),
device  IDs,  and  geo-tokens,  enabling  the  system  to  infer  proximity  among  entities  that  co-occur  in
legitimate routines or in coordinated abuse. Autoencoders compress transaction windows  into low-
dimensional  codes  where  reconstruction  error  signals  deviance;  variational  autoencoders  (VAEs)
extend this idea by modeling latent distributions, which supports thresholding by probabilistic rarity.
On  graph-structured  views  of  banking  ecosystems—cardholder–merchant  bipartite  graphs,  device–
account  linkages,  or  money-flow  networks—graph neural networks  (GNNs)  propagate  signals over
neighborhoods to  surface  organized  rings  and mule  clusters  that  are not  obvious  at  the  individual-
transaction level (Hossain et al., 2023). Sequence encoders combine time gaps, amounts, MCCs, and
locations to learn trajectory-aware embeddings sensitive to tempo and periodicity. Attention weights
and  saliency  maps  provide  localized  explanations  of  which  events,  merchants,  or  intervals  were
informative,  supporting  analyst  review  and  model  governance  (Sultan  et  al.,  2023).  Surveys  and
domain studies underscore that these learned representations reduce reliance on brittle expert rules
and ease adaptation across portfolios with different spending cultures, while maintaining screening
accuracy at low fraud base rates.
Data Imbalance and Real-Time Processing Challenges
A  central  methodological  challenge  in  digital  banking  fraud  detection  lies  in  the  class  imbalance
problem,  where  fraudulent  transactions  represent  only  a  minute  fraction  of  the  total  transaction
volume. Research consistently demonstrates that conventional classifiers trained on such skewed data

44

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

tend to favor the majority class, resulting in high overall accuracy but poor recall of fraudulent cases.
Oversampling techniques, including random oversampling and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique (SMOTE), have been widely adopted to rebalance datasets by generating synthetic minority
class samples. SMOTE and its extensions, such as Borderline-SMOTE and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling
(ADASYN),  improve  minority  representation  while  reducing  overfitting  compared  to  naïve
duplication (Hossen et al., 2023; Razzaq & Shah, 2025). Conversely, undersampling methods selectively
remove majority class samples to achieve class balance, though often at the cost of discarding useful
information.  Cost-sensitive  learning  approaches  provide  an  alternative  by  assigning  higher
misclassification penalties to fraudulent cases, thereby aligning model optimization with real-world
financial  risks  (Tawfiqul,  2023).  Ensemble  methods  such  as  EasyEnsemble  and  BalanceCascade
combine  undersampling  with  boosting  to  enhance  detection  capability  without  compromising  the
integrity of majority class data (Sanjai et al., 2023). Empirical evidence across fraud detection studies
highlights  that  hybrid  approaches—combining  SMOTE  with  cost-sensitive  ensembles—achieve
superior recall while maintaining precision in highly imbalanced digital banking datasets. Collectively,
the  literature  underscores  that  imbalanced  learning  is  not  merely  a  preprocessing  issue  but  a  core
methodological priority for fraud detection in financial services (Akter et al., 2023).

Figure 6: Data Imbalance and Real Time Processing Challenges

identifiers,  geolocation,  temporal

Fraud detection models depend heavily on the quality and relevance of features extracted from raw
transaction  data.  High-dimensional  datasets  typical  in  digital  banking  include  transaction  amounts,
merchant
information,  device  fingerprints,  and  customer
demographics,  often  generating  hundreds  or  thousands  of  variables.  Effective  feature  engineering
seeks to capture behavioral signatures of fraud, such as velocity features (number of transactions within
a time window), burst spending patterns, or sudden geographic jumps in purchase location. Feature
selection  methods,  including  recursive  feature  elimination,  mutual  information,  and  principal
component analysis (PCA), reduce dimensionality while preserving predictive power. Wrapper-based
methods evaluate subsets of features through iterative model training, whereas embedded techniques
such  as  LASSO  regularization  incorporate  feature  selection  directly  into  the  learning  algorithm.
Representation  learning  through  deep  autoencoders  and  graph  embeddings  provides  a  data-driven
alternative by constructing compact latent spaces without extensive manual engineering. Studies by
(Zhang  et  al.,  2025)  demonstrate  that  careful  feature  engineering  enhances  classifier  robustness,
particularly under covariate shifts in customer behavior. Moreover, comparative evaluations show that
models with feature-rich transaction contexts consistently outperform those relying on raw attributes
alone. The literature highlights that feature engineering is not a one-time step but an iterative process
aligned with both fraud patterns and system-specific constraints.
The  operational  deployment  of  fraud  detection  models  requires  balancing  predictive  accuracy  with
stringent real-time constraints imposed by digital banking infrastructures. Large-scale systems such as

45

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

card  authorization  networks  demand  responses  within  milliseconds,  leaving  little  room  for
computationally intensive algorithms. Research emphasizes that high-latency models, even if accurate,
risk  delaying  transaction  approvals  and  negatively  impacting  customer  experience.  Consequently,
fraud detection systems often employ lightweight feature extraction pipelines and optimized models
to  meet  latency  requirements.  Parallel  processing  frameworks  and  distributed  computing,  such  as
Apache Spark and GPU acceleration, have been integrated to scale detection capacity across millions
of transactions per second. Another major constraint lies in false-positive management: overly sensitive
models may flag legitimate transactions, creating unnecessary declines that erode customer trust and
revenue. Studies highlight that cost-sensitive thresholding and adaptive feedback loops are critical to
balancing  fraud  detection  sensitivity  with  operational  efficiency.  Furthermore,  compliance
requirements such as GDPR and PSD2 introduce restrictions on data storage, processing, and cross-
border  transfer,  adding  complexity  to  real-time  fraud  detection  pipelines  (Altalhan  et  al.,  2025).
Collectively, the literature indicates that real-time fraud detection must address not only algorithmic
efficiency but also regulatory alignment, system scalability, and customer experience.
Interpretability in Fraud Detection Systems
Evaluating  fraud  detection  systems  requires  performance  metrics  that  account  for  the  highly
imbalanced nature of financial transaction datasets, where fraudulent events constitute less than 1% of
all  transactions.  Standard  metrics  such  as  accuracy  can  be  misleading,  as  models  predicting  all
transactions  as  legitimate  would  achieve  near-perfect  accuracy  while  failing  to  detect  actual  fraud.
Precision  and  recall  have  therefore  become  central  indicators:  precision  measures  the  proportion  of
flagged frauds that are truly fraudulent, while recall quantifies the proportion of actual frauds correctly
identified.  The  F1-score,  the  harmonic  mean  of  precision  and  recall,  balances  these  dimensions  and
provides a more holistic evaluation metric.

Figure 7: Real-Time Banking Fraud Detection Framework

In  addition,  the  area  under  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve  (ROC-AUC) has  been widely
used  to  evaluate  classifier  discrimination  across  thresholds,  but  scholars  note  that  ROC-AUC  can
overstate performance in imbalanced contexts (Krawczyk, 2016). As a result, the precision-recall area
under  the  curve  (PR-AUC)  is  increasingly  preferred  for  fraud  detection  tasks,  as  it  emphasizes  the
minority class performance. Cost-sensitive evaluation frameworks extend these metrics by weighting
false negatives more heavily than false positives, aligning model evaluation with financial risk realities.
Thus, the literature underscores that the choice of performance metrics is not only statistical but also
context-specific, with profound implications for the operational utility of fraud detection systems in
digital banking (Kota et al., 2004).

A persistent theme in fraud detection research is the trade-off between maximizing predictive accuracy
and ensuring interpretability of machine learning models (Parsa et al., 2019). Traditional models such
as  logistic  regression  and  decision  trees  provide  transparent  decision-making  processes,  enabling
auditors and regulators to understand why a transaction was classified as fraudulent. However, while
interpretable,  these  models  often  underperform  compared  to  complex  ensembles  or  deep  neural
networks, which achieve higher detection accuracy but operate as “black boxes”. Financial institutions
face  the  challenge  of  balancing  these  two  dimensions:  on  the  one  hand,  maximizing  fraud  capture
reduces financial losses, but on the other, lack of transparency complicates regulatory compliance and
undermines user trust. Research suggests that interpretability cannot be sacrificed entirely for accuracy,
as explainability is essential for mitigating risks of bias, error propagation, and legal liability. Hybrid
approaches  such  as  using  interpretable  surrogate  models  to  approximate  black-box  outputs    and
integrating feature  importance  rankings  within  ensemble  frameworks  (Lundberg  &  Lee, 2017)  have
been developed to bridge this gap. The literature converges on the idea that fraud detection requires
not merely high-performing models but also explainable mechanisms to support decision-making in
compliance-driven environments (Awosika et al., 2024).
Cross-Regional Insights
European fraud analytics operates within a dense regulatory architecture that directly shapes model
design,  data  access,  and  operational  thresholds.  The  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (PSD2)
requires open banking via access-to-account interfaces and mandates Strong Customer Authentication
(SCA),  with  the  EBA’s  Regulatory  Technical  Standards  (RTS)  specifying  multi-factor  controls  and
conditions  for  Transaction  Risk  Analysis  (TRA)  exemptions  (Kaslow  &  Biernaux,  2015).  TRA  ties
authentication leniency to empirically demonstrated fraud rates, which in practice couples machine-
learning performance metrics to supervisory tolerances. GDPR further constrains feature construction,
lawful bases for processing, and model explainability obligations, thereby pushing institutions toward
privacy-preserving  pipelines  and  auditable  detection  logic.  Cross-border  SEPA  rails  and  ISO  20022
migrations  standardize  message  fields  that  feed  fraud  features,  aiding  portability  of  engineered
variables  across  member  states.  Empirical  and  review  studies  note  that  EU  card-not-present  fraud
remains  a  key  pressure  point,  encouraging  sequential  and  anomaly-based  monitors  aligned  to  SCA
step-up policies (Ranta et al., 2018). Post-implementation assessments associate SCA with reductions
in  unauthorized  transactions,  while  also  documenting  shifts  in  fraudster  adaptation  patterns  that
sustain the need for TRA-driven recalibration. Operationally, European banks emphasize interpretable
models  and  traceable  data  lineage  to  satisfy  audit  trails,  with  XAI  overlays  increasingly  used  to
evidence  proportionality  and  fairness.  Academic  syntheses  underline  that  EU  institutions  optimize
under multi-objective constraints—fraud loss, user friction, and regulatory compliance—where risk-
sensitive  thresholds  and  periodic  model  validation  are  embedded  in  governance.  Collectively,
PSD2/SCA, GDPR, and pan-European payment harmonization form a regime in which fraud detection
is inseparable from supervisory metrics and explainability requirements (Yang et al., 2025).
North American fraud detection reflects a more market-led configuration that prioritizes data-driven
experimentation, cloud-native pipelines, and bilateral fintech-bank partnerships. Rather than a single
open-banking mandate, U.S. data sharing has evolved through private API ecosystems and industry
frameworks,  enabling  rapid  prototyping  of  graph,  sequence,  and  streaming  models  on  large-scale
authorization  data.  Supervisory  expectations  focus  on  model  risk  governance  and  safety-and-
soundness—e.g.,  SR  11-7/OCC  guidance  on  validation,  challenger  testing,  and  monitoring—which
conditions deployment with documentation, back-testing, and concept-drift surveillance.
AML/CFT  rules  (FinCEN)  and  sectoral  privacy  regimes  intersect  with  PCI  DSS  and  NIST  digital
identity guidance, shaping feature eligibility and authentication orchestration without prescribing a
single  SCA-style  template.  Empirical  studies  describe  banks  and  card  networks  co-developing
ensemble and deep-sequence models, leveraging consortium signals and merchant intelligence to lift
precision  at  fixed  review  budgets.  Fintech  partnerships  accelerate  adoption  of  graph-based  entity
resolution, device intelligence, and behavior biometrics in risk scoring, with regulators emphasizing
explainability  and  adverse-action  logic  when  outcomes  affect  consumers.  Comparative  work  notes
higher tolerance for model complexity provided validation evidence is robust and performance gains
are material, reinforcing a culture of iterative tuning and A/B experimentation across channels. The

47

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

literature thus characterizes North America by flexible data collaboration, rigorous model governance,
and strong private-sector roles in scaling ML fraud detection (Bartkowski et al., 2023).

Figure 8: Global Fraud Detection Regulatory Framework

Fraud detection in emerging economies is shaped by mobile-first adoption, cash-digital interlinkages,
and heterogeneous institutional capacity. Financial inclusion has expanded through mobile money and
fast-payment  platforms, generating  distinctive  transaction  topologies—agent  networks,  peer-to-peer
rails,  and  micro-merchant  ecosystems—that  alter  fraud  typologies  and  feature  design.  Governance
frameworks  vary  widely:  some  jurisdictions  deploy  real-time  retail  payments  with  central  bank
stewardship (e.g., Brazil’s Pix; India’s UPI), which yields standardized data fields supportive of ML
features  and  centralized  fraud  intelligence;  others  rely  on  fragmented  private  rails  with  uneven
reporting.  Studies  document  that  identity  infrastructure—SIM  registration,  national  ID,  e-KYC—
conditions the feasibility of linking accounts, devices, and beneficiaries, affecting the power of graph-
based  detection.  AML/CFT  compliance  under  FATF  standards  influences  data  retention  and  cross-
border  information  sharing,  with  mutual  evaluations  highlighting  needs  for  improved  suspicious
transaction  reporting  and  analytics  capacity.  Case  literature  on  South  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa
shows that agent collusion, social-engineering rings, and mule networks require hybrid anomaly-and-
rule  monitors  tuned  to  local  usage  cycles  and  liquidity  patterns.  Research  on  Bangladesh,  Kenya,
Mexico, and Nigeria associates improvements in rails and supervision with measurable gains in alert
quality and decline management when standardized reference data becomes available. Across studies,
infrastructure  maturity,  data  standardization,  and  supervisory  capacity  are  repeatedly  identified  as
levers  determining  which  ML  paradigms—tabular  ensembles,  sequential  encoders,  or  graph
networks—yield operational lift in emerging markets (Laurentis & Pearson, 2021).
Fraud Detection Models into Banking Ecosystems
Deployment of fraud detection models in banking ecosystems proceeds through staged pipelines that
align data engineering, model risk governance, and production monitoring. Studies describe reference
patterns that begin with offline back-testing against historical authorizations, proceed to shadow-mode
runs  in  parallel  with  incumbent  rules,  and  culminate  in  canary  or  phased  rollouts  keyed  to  loss
exposure  and  customer  segments.  Financial  institutions  formalize  this  lifecycle  under  supervisory
guidance for model risk management—validation, challenger models, and performance monitoring—
documented in banking oversight literature (Radzi et al., 2025). Production controls emphasize cost-
sensitive thresholds and queue triage that prioritize high-lift alerts given limited investigator capacity.
Empirical work reports that ensembles or deep sequence models are often deployed as risk scores that
feed existing case-management systems rather than as hard rejects, thereby preserving human-in-the-
loop review and auditability. Change-control literature in banking highlights blue/green deployments

48

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

and  A/B  testing  to  quantify  incremental  lift  while  containing  operational  risk.  Institutions  also
implement drift monitoring—population stability indices, calibration charts, and challenger rotation—
to sustain performance under seasonality, product launches, and portfolio shifts. Governance artifacts
such as model inventories, use-case narratives, and explainability packs (e.g., SHAP/LIME summaries)
support  second-line  review  and  external  audit.  Across  studies,  effective  deployment  emerges  as  an
organizational  routine  that  couples  statistical  metrics  (PR-AUC,  recall  at  fixed  precision)  with
operational KPIs (decline accuracy, investigator productivity), ensuring that statistical gains translate
into measurable loss containment within regulatory constraints (Johora et al., 2024).
Interoperability  requirements  shape  how  models  interface  with  core  banking,  card  authorization
switches,  and  real-time  payment  rails.  Payment  systems  research  shows  that  standardized  message
formats—ISO  8583  for  cards  and  ISO  20022  for  modern  account-to-account  rails—govern  feature
accessibility and latency budgets for scoring at the point of authorization. In practice, banks embed
scoring  services  behind  gateway  APIs  or  message  brokers  that  stream  events  to  model  servers  and
return risk decisions within strict service-level objectives to avoid customer friction. Studies emphasize
pre-computed features (velocity counters, device/merchant embeddings) stored in low-latency key-
value  stores  to  meet  sub-second  constraints,  while  batch  jobs  refresh  longer-horizon  profiles.
Interoperability  also  spans  authentication  orchestration  under  regulatory  regimes:  in  the  EU,
PSD2/SCA  links  risk  scores  to  Transaction  Risk  Analysis  exemptions  and  step-up  flows,  requiring
traceable  inputs  and  explainable  outputs  for  audit.  In  North  America,  integration  patterns  reflect
private API ecosystems, PCI DSS controls on cardholder data, and NIST digital identity guidance that
influence which features can be engineered and persisted. Empirical reports document graph-based
services  running  alongside  case  management  to  correlate  devices,  accounts,  and  merchants  across
channels, with alerts federated back to legacy fraud managers via adapters. Interoperability research
thus  frames  fraud  models  as  modular  risk  services  living  within  a  larger  payments  fabric,  where
message standards, privacy mandates, and legacy constraints determine the feasible envelope for real-
time analytics (Roy & Prabhakaran, 2023a).
Organizational  scholarship  identifies  barriers  to  adopting  ML  fraud  systems  that  include  legacy  IT
complexity,  fragmented  ownership  across  risk,  compliance,  and  technology,  and  constraints  arising
from regulatory documentation requirements. Cultural hesitancy toward “black-box” models persists,
which  literature  addresses  through  explainability  toolkits  and  model  cards  that  translate  technical
evidence into audit-ready narratives. Workforce adaptation features prominently: analysts accustomed
to  rule-based  cues  must  shift  to  probability-ranked  queues  and  reason  over  SHAP  or  attention
heatmaps;  training  programs  and  playbooks  reduce  investigation  variance  and  improve  case
throughput.

Figure 9: Fraud Deployment in Banking Ecosystem

Governance research underscores the importance of role clarity between first-line detection teams and
second-line model validation, with escalation paths for threshold changes and documented acceptance
criteria.  Studies  on  data  governance  report  that  GDPR/PSD2  in  Europe  and  sectoral  privacy  plus
PCI/NIST frameworks in North America shape retention, lineage, and access controls, which in turn
affect  feature  availability  and  analyst  tooling.  Case  work  in  emerging  markets  connects  capacity
building—SQL/feature engineering fluency, labeling quality, and case taxonomy harmonization—to
steady gains in precision at fixed review budgets. Organizational adoption studies thus converge on
the  need  for  structured  change  management,  explicit  validation  standards,  and  analyst-centric  XAI
artifacts to embed models into everyday fraud operations (Roy & Prabhakaran, 2023b).
Literature synthesizing deployments across regions depicts an integrated operating model in which
analytics, engineering, and operations co-evolve under regulatory oversight. Model portfolios combine
supervised classifiers, anomaly detectors, and graph analytics, exposed as tiered services that support
pre-authorization  screening,  post-authorization  monitoring,  and  retrospective
investigations.
Performance  management  couples  statistical  indicators—PR-AUC,  recall  at  fixed  precision,  cost
curves—with business KPIs such as prevented loss, customer-initiated dispute rates, and investigator
productivity  (Banu  et  al.,  2024).  Interpretable  overlays  (LIME/SHAP,  attention  summaries)  and
documentation bundles satisfy audit and adverse-action explanation duties while enabling feedback
loops  from  investigators  to  recalibrate  features  and  thresholds.  Institutions  maintain  technical
resilience  through  drift dashboards,  challenger  rotations,  and  periodic  model  reviews  mandated by
policy,  reinforcing  accountability  and  stability  across  product  seasons  and  portfolio  shifts.
Interoperability with core systems depends on standards (ISO 20022/8583), privacy/security controls
and gateway patterns that bound latency for real-time decisioning. Across case syntheses, sustained
integration is associated with clear ownership, repeatable MRM processes, and workforce fluency in
both analytics and casework, which collectively anchor model efficacy within the institutional fabric of
banking operations (Găbudeanu et al., 2021).
Comparative Reviews and Gaps in Scholarship: Toward a Systematic Synthesis
The secondary literature on fraud detection in financial services spans foundational surveys of data‐
mining techniques, domain‐specific reviews in banking and payments, and assessments of evaluation
practice.  Early  syntheses  framed  fraud  detection  as  a  data‐mining  problem,  mapping  classification,
clustering,  and  anomaly  detection  to  financial  datasets  and  highlighting  operational  constraints  in
banking. Methodological surveys positioned supervised learners—logistic regression, support vector
machines,  and
tree  ensembles—alongside  unsupervised  and  semi-supervised  approaches,
emphasizing trade-offs among interpretability, computational cost, and sensitivity to class imbalance
(Rani  &  Mittal,  2023).  Reviews  of  evaluation  practice  cautioned  that  accuracy  and  ROC-AUC  can
mislead under severe skew, recommending precision–recall analysis, cost curves, and scenario-specific
utility measures. Domain syntheses documented the growing role of deep architectures in payment
fraud,  credit  card  streams,  and  online  channels,  citing  empirical  gains  for  sequence  models  and
ensembles  while  noting  integration  challenges  in  regulated  settings.  Parallel  anomaly-detection
surveys  provided  a  broader  statistical  backdrop  for  rare-event  mining  and  change  detection.  More
recent  reviews  examined  representation  learning  and  graph  methods  for  ring  detection  and  entity
resolution, placing GNNs and embedding techniques within the fraud toolkit. Across these syntheses,
recurrent themes include dataset scarcity and confidentiality, heterogeneity of metrics, and institutional
constraints that shape feasible deployments. Collectively, prior reviews establish a baseline taxonomy
of methods and operational considerations, while leaving unresolved questions about cross-regional
comparability, reproducibility, and the linkage between model performance and governance outcomes
(Wang et al., 2024).
Methodologically,  several  gaps  recur  across  the  secondary  literature.  First,  extreme  class  imbalance
remains unevenly handled: while oversampling (e.g., SMOTE and variants) and cost-sensitive learning
are  well  documented,  many  comparative  studies  report  results  without  calibrated  costs  or  with
sampling  strategies  that  complicate  external  validity.  Second,  evaluation  practice  is  heterogeneous;
ROC-AUC persists as a headline metric even when PR-AUC, expected cost, and recall at fixed precision

50

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

offer  more  decision-relevant  views  under  skew.  Third,  reproducibility  is  constrained  by  private
datasets  and  opaque  feature  pipelines;  few  studies  release  code  or  standardized  benchmarks  that
capture  real  authorization  latencies,  label  uncertainty,  and  concept  drift.  Fourth,  robustness  to
distributional  shift  and  adversarial  manipulation  appears  inconsistently  assessed,  even  though
transaction  mixes  evolve  and  attackers  adapt  (Sriram  et  al.,  2022).  Fifth,  representation  learning
advances—autoencoders,  variational  methods,  sequence  encoders,  and  graphs—are  reported  with
promising lift but often lack ablations that isolate contributions from embeddings versus engineered
features.  Sixth,  explainability  is  treated  post-hoc  with  LIME  or  SHAP,  yet  standardized  tests  for
faithfulness and stability across operating points are not uniformly applied. Finally, cross-dataset and
cross-jurisdiction  generalization  is  infrequently  examined,  limiting  claims  about  portability  of
thresholds and features across PSD2/SCA, PCI/NIST, or emerging-market rails.

Figure 10: Fraud Detection Literature Synthesis

Beyond methods, theoretical articulation lags empirical progress. The literature applies criminological
constructs  such  as  the  fraud  triangle  to  motivate  risk  factors,  yet  few  studies  formalize  how  such
theories  map  to  feature  hierarchies  or  model  priors  in  transaction  monitoring.  Enterprise  risk-
management and model-risk frameworks define validation and governance, but connections between
statistical metrics and supervisory thresholds (e.g., TRA under SCA) are seldom modeled explicitly.
Discussions  of  interpretability  often  center  on  toolkits  rather  than  theory-driven  criteria—such  as
accountability,  contestability,  and  evidential  sufficiency—that  link  explanations  to  institutional
decision rights. Causal reasoning is rarely invoked, leaving open questions about policy interventions
(authentication  step-ups,  spending  limits)  and  their  effects  on  observed  fraud  rates  versus  true
incidence  (Lunny  et  al.,  2018).  Likewise,  theoretical  accounts  of  networked  fraud  emphasize
community structure and contagion analogies, but formal models that tie graph signals to compliance
obligations  and  investigative  workflows  remain  sparse.  Cross-regional  theory  is  fragmented:
regulatory and cultural contexts are acknowledged descriptively, yet few frameworks generalize how
infrastructure, privacy mandates, and payment customs shape the feasible frontier of algorithms and
metrics.  These  theoretical  gaps  delimit  the  explanatory  power  of  current  syntheses  and  motivate
structured aggregation that aligns models, metrics, and governance concepts under common constructs
(Brass et al., 2018).
The  heterogeneity  documented  in  prior  reviews—spanning  algorithms,  representations,  datasets,
metrics, and governance regimes—creates a fragmented evidentiary base that benefits from systematic
consolidation.  A  protocol-driven  synthesis  clarifies  inclusion  criteria,  harmonizes  terminology  (e.g.,
distinguishing detection from prevention; PR-AUC from ROC-AUC), and maps methods to operational

51

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

contexts  defined  by  latency  budgets,  case-management  practices,  and  regulatory  constraints.
Systematic procedures rooted in established guidance provide transparent selection, quality appraisal,
and traceable evidence tables, improving comparability across studies and reducing narrative bias. A
cross-regional lens enables structured comparison of PSD2/SCA-constrained European deployments,
model-risk-governed North American practices, and infrastructure-dependent approaches in emerging
economies,  aligning  algorithmic  findings  with  institutional  parameters.  Consolidating  evidence  on
imbalanced  learning,  evaluation  metrics,  explainability,  and  robustness  organizes  methodological
choices into decision frameworks that reflect observed cost structures and investigation capacities. By
assembling a reproducible map of techniques, datasets, metrics, and governance linkages, the synthesis
provides an integrated reference for researchers and practitioners, grounded in documented outcomes
rather than isolated case claims (Soundararajan et al., 2018).
METHOD
This  study  adhered  to  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor, transparency, and replicability throughout the
review process (Lunny et al., 2017). The PRISMA framework was selected because of its emphasis on
structured  search  strategies,  eligibility  criteria,  and  reporting  standards  that  minimize  bias  and
maximize the reliability of synthesized findings.

Figure 11: Methodology of this study

The  review  process  unfolded  in  four  distinct  phases—identification,  screening,  eligibility,  and
inclusion—each guided by established PRISMA protocols. A systematic approach was required due to
the  multidisciplinary  nature  of  fraud  detection  literature,  which  spans  computer  science,  finance,
criminology,  and  information  systems  research.  By  applying  the  PRISMA  framework,  the  study
ensured that decisions on study inclusion were transparent, replicable, and grounded in predefined
criteria.

52

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

In  the  identification  phase,  multiple  databases  were  queried  to  capture  the  breadth  of  relevant
scholarship.  Databases  included  Scopus,  Web  of  Science,  IEEE  Xplore,  ACM  Digital  Library,  and
ScienceDirect, as well as specialized repositories in finance and banking such as SSRN and Emerald
Insight. Search terms were developed through an iterative process combining Boolean operators and
controlled  vocabulary.  Examples  of  key  terms  included  “machine  learning  AND  fraud  detection,”
“digital  banking  AND  anomaly  detection,”  “credit  card  fraud  AND  deep  learning,”  and  “financial
services  AND  predictive  analytics.”  The  search  was  not  limited  by  publication  year  to  capture  the
historical progression of fraud detection research, but only peer-reviewed journal articles, conference
proceedings,  and  institutional  reports  were  retained  to  maintain  quality.  This  broad  search  initially
yielded  2,346  records  across  all  sources,  which  were  then  imported  into  a  reference  management
software for deduplication.
The  screening  phase  involved  applying  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  to  the  titles  and  abstracts.
Studies were retained if they focused on the application of machine learning, artificial intelligence, or
data mining in the context of fraud detection within financial services or digital banking. Exclusion
criteria included studies unrelated to financial contexts (e.g., healthcare fraud), studies focusing solely
on  cybersecurity  without  fraud  detection  applications,  and  non-English  publications.  After  the
application of these criteria, 1,104 records were excluded, leaving 1,242 articles for further review. At
this stage, duplicate studies and those that lacked sufficient methodological detail were also removed.
During the eligibility phase, full-text reviews were conducted to assess methodological rigor, clarity of
results,  and  relevance  to  the  research  question.  Only  studies  that  provided  empirical  evidence,
experimental  validation,  or  systematic  discussions  of  fraud  detection  models  were  considered.  For
example, papers that introduced novel machine learning algorithms but did not test them on financial
data  were  excluded.  Following  this  process,  214  articles  met  the  eligibility  requirements  and  were
subjected  to  detailed  coding.  Data  extraction  sheets  were  prepared  to  capture  study  characteristics,
including  authorship,  year  of  publication,  region  of  study,  dataset  characteristics,  algorithm  types,
evaluation metrics, and key findings. This structured coding ensured comparability across studies and
facilitated synthesis (Hassan et al., 2023).
Finally, the inclusion phase resulted in 118 studies being retained for systematic review. These included
36 studies employing supervised learning methods, 27 focusing on unsupervised or anomaly detection
approaches,  19  exploring  hybrid  paradigms,  21  highlighting  deep  learning  architectures,  and  15
dealing  primarily  with  evaluation  metrics  and  interpretability  frameworks.  The  variation  in
methodological  approaches  reflects  the  evolving  nature  of  machine  learning  applications  in  fraud
detection,  with  studies  ranging  from  early  rule-based  and  logistic  regression  techniques  to  recent
advancements  in  recurrent  neural  networks  and  graph-based  learning.  In  addition,  a  subset  of
institutional reports from the European Central Bank, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and
the  Federal  Reserve  were  included  to  contextualize  academic  findings  within  regulatory  and
operational frameworks. By following the PRISMA guidelines, the review process ensured that study
selection  was  transparent,  replicable,  and  systematically  aligned  with  the  objectives  of  synthesizing
evidence on machine learning paradigms for fraud detection in digital banking. The resulting pool of
studies provides a robust evidence base, capturing historical development, methodological diversity,
and  cross-regional  insights  that  together  inform  the  systematic  analysis  presented  in  subsequent
sections of this review.
FINDINGS
The first significant finding of this review is the dominance of supervised learning methods in digital
banking  fraud  detection  research.  Out  of  the  118  studies  included  in  the  final  analysis,  36  focused
primarily  on supervised  classification  techniques  such  as  decision  trees,  logistic  regression,  support
vector  machines,  random  forests,  and  gradient  boosting  methods.  These  studies  collectively
accumulated  more  than  9,200  citations  across  academic  databases,  underscoring  their  enduring
influence in shaping the core foundations of fraud detection models. A recurring trend was the use of
labeled  transaction  datasets,  often  drawn  from  credit  card  payments  or  online  banking  systems,  to
build  and  validate  predictive  models.  The  high  number  of  citations  reflects  not  only  the  technical
relevance of supervised learning but also its accessibility and interpretability for financial institutions.
Despite  methodological  advancements  in  other  areas,  supervised  models  remain  the  most  widely

53

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

adopted due to their balance between accuracy and explainability. This body of work demonstrates
that  while  newer  methods  continue  to  emerge,  the  reliance  on  supervised  learning  as  a  benchmark
persists across the literature, indicating its centrality in both academic and applied contexts.
A  second  major  finding  relates  to  the  increasing  interest  in  unsupervised  learning  and  anomaly
detection  techniques.  Among  the  reviewed  studies,  27  employed  unsupervised  methods  such  as
clustering, density-based detection, and statistical anomaly identification to capture fraudulent activity
in  highly  imbalanced  datasets.  Together,  these  studies  received  over  6,800  citations,  reflecting  the
academic  community’s  recognition  of  their  value  in  identifying  novel  or  previously  unseen  fraud
patterns. Unlike supervised methods, unsupervised approaches do not depend on labeled data, making
them particularly valuable in contexts where fraud evolves too quickly for comprehensive labeling.
The  reviewed  articles  highlighted  how  unsupervised  methods  have  gradually  shifted  from  being
experimental  to  becoming  a  critical  complement  to  supervised  learning  in  production  systems.  The
citation  counts  associated  with  these  studies  demonstrate  growing  credibility  in  the  research
community, as unsupervised detection is increasingly viewed as essential for combating sophisticated
fraud  typologies.  This  finding  illustrates  a  methodological  broadening  of  fraud  detection  research,
moving beyond labeled datasets toward adaptive detection strategies.
The  review  also  revealed  the  strong  emergence  of  deep  learning  architectures  in  transaction
monitoring.  Out  of  the  final  pool,  21  studies  explicitly  focused  on  deep  learning  approaches,
particularly recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and hybrid deep
architectures. These studies accounted for more than 7,300 citations in aggregate, a remarkable number
given  that  many  of  them  were  published  relatively  recently  compared  to  foundational  supervised
learning studies. A key insight from this group of articles is the capacity of deep learning to process
sequential data and capture hidden patterns across long transaction histories, features that traditional
models  often  miss.  The  volume  of  citations  highlights  both  enthusiasm  and  confidence  in  these
methods within the research community. Furthermore, the growing body of deep learning literature
signals a transition toward advanced architectures capable of addressing challenges posed by large-
scale,  high-dimensional  transaction  data.  While  still  less  numerous  than  studies  on  supervised
methods, the rapid rise of deep learning demonstrates its increasing prominence in the fraud detection
research landscape.
Another significant finding centers on the evaluation metrics and interpretability frameworks used in
fraud detection systems. Fifteen of the included studies dealt directly with these topics, focusing on
how  performance  indicators  such  as  precision,  recall,  F1-score,  and  PR-AUC  provide  a  more
meaningful  assessment  of  fraud  detection  systems  compared  to  accuracy  alone.  Collectively,  these
studies  garnered  more  than  4,500  citations,  indicating  the  importance  of  evaluation  rigor  and
interpretability  in  the  scholarly  conversation.  The  literature  consistently  emphasized  that  fraud
detection cannot be judged solely on statistical accuracy, as false positives and false negatives carry
different  financial  and  operational  costs.  The  strong  citation  base  of  these  studies  highlights  their
foundational role in shaping how fraud detection systems are validated and integrated into banking
operations. In addition, interpretability studies demonstrated the importance of ensuring transparency
in algorithmic decision-making, a concern that has become particularly salient in regulated banking
environments. The high citation counts confirm that evaluation and interpretability are not secondary
considerations but central pillars in the development of effective fraud detection systems.
The final notable finding is the increasing prominence of hybrid approaches that combine supervised,
unsupervised,  and  deep  learning  strategies,  as  well  as  studies  focusing  on  integration  into  banking
ecosystems. Nineteen studies in the review employed hybrid frameworks, which together accounted
for over 5,600 citations, showing the community’s recognition of their potential in balancing precision,
recall, and adaptability. These studies demonstrated that hybrid approaches outperform single-method
models by capturing both known and unknown fraud patterns. In addition, the review identified 118
studies  overall  that  collectively  referenced  issues  of  integration  with  banking  ecosystems,  covering
deployment  strategies,  regulatory  compliance,  and  workforce  adaptation.  The  fact  that  hybrid
approaches  alone  have  accumulated  thousands  of  citations  underscores  the  field’s  recognition  that
fraud  detection  cannot  rely  on  a  single  methodological  family.  Instead,  effective  solutions  emerge
through integration, both at the algorithmic level and within the broader institutional and regulatory

54

landscape. The reviewed studies collectively demonstrate that hybridization and ecosystem integration
are increasingly viewed as the frontier of fraud detection research, positioning these themes as pivotal
to the ongoing evolution of the field.
DISCUSSION
The review’s finding that supervised learning remains the dominant paradigm in fraud detection aligns
with earlier surveys that emphasized the accessibility, interpretability, and reliability of these methods.
(Kayan-Fadlelmula et al., 2022) highlighted the wide adoption of decision trees, logistic regression, and
support vector machines in early banking fraud research, a trend confirmed in this study’s analysis of
36 supervised-focused articles. The consistency of supervised models’ influence reflects their suitability
for  structured,  labeled  datasets  common  in  banking  environments  (Edge  &  Sampaio,  2009).  While
recent  studies  have  advocated  for  deep  learning  and  hybrid  models,  the  continued  reliance  on
supervised  learning  echoes  earlier  findings  that  institutions  often  prioritize  interpretability  and
compliance  readiness  over  methodological  novelty.  This  study  reinforces  that  supervised  methods
provide a critical benchmark for evaluating new models, confirming prior claims that they serve as the
backbone of empirical fraud detection research (Gyamfi & Abdulai, 2018).
The growing emphasis on unsupervised and anomaly detection approaches observed in this review
builds upon earlier findings that stressed the limitations of supervised models in capturing novel fraud.
Gulluscio  et  al.  (2020)  first  introduced  statistical  anomaly  detection  frameworks  to  financial  fraud,
showing their potential in identifying irregular patterns without labels. Later studies, such as Mengist
et al. (2020), confirmed that unsupervised methods are essential for addressing class imbalance and
emerging fraud strategies. The 27 studies in this review focusing on anomaly detection reflect the field’s
broadening  acceptance  of  these  methods,  a  trend  corroborated  by  Dritsas  and  Trigka  (2025),  who
applied graph-based unsupervised learning to reveal collusive fraud. Compared with earlier literature
that treated unsupervised learning as experimental or supplementary, the high citation counts in this
review suggest that such methods are now considered central to fraud detection research. This aligns
with  Birindelli  and  Ferretti  (2017),  who  argued  that  anomaly  detection  techniques  provide  critical
adaptability in rapidly evolving financial ecosystems.
A significant contribution of this review is the confirmation of deep learning’s rising influence in fraud
detection, particularly in sequential transaction monitoring. Earlier studies by Razzaq and Shah (2025)
demonstrated  that  recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs)  and  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)
outperform traditional models in capturing temporal and local dependencies in transaction data. The
21 deep learning studies analyzed here, which collectively accrued over 7,300 citations, reinforce those
findings  and  confirm  Sarna  et  al.,(  2025)’s  argument  that  deep  learning  architectures  are  redefining
fraud detection benchmarks. The comparative advantage of deep learning over traditional supervised
approaches  echoes  Dritsas  and  Trigka  (2025)’s  view  that  representation  learning  allows  models  to
identify subtle, non-linear fraud patterns. However, the review also finds that deployment challenges,
including interpretability and computational cost, mirror earlier critiques by Trigka and Dritsas (2025)
that  sophisticated  models  often  struggle  in  regulatory  banking  environments.  Thus,  while  deep
learning  demonstrates  superior  accuracy,  its  broader  adoption  remains  contingent  on  overcoming
barriers identified in earlier scholarship (AlHaddad et al., 2023).
This  review  highlights  the  centrality  of  evaluation  metrics  and  interpretability  frameworks  in
contemporary  fraud  detection  research,  a  finding  that  resonates  with  Arsalan  et  al.  (2025),  who
critiqued over-reliance on accuracy and ROC-AUC in skewed datasets. The 15 studies in this review
focusing  on  precision,  recall,  F1-score,  and  PR-AUC  confirm  that  cost-sensitive  and  imbalanced
learning  metrics  are  essential  for  realistic  fraud  detection  assessment.  This  parallels  the
recommendations of Zhu et al. (2025), who emphasized PR-AUC as a superior evaluation tool in highly
imbalanced  domains.  The  emphasis  on  interpretability  frameworks,  particularly  SHAP  and  LIME,
aligns  with  argument  that  transparency  is  necessary  for  algorithmic  trust  in  high-stakes  domains.
Similarly stressed the role of local and global interpretability in enabling human analysts to validate
predictions. The findings of this review suggest continuity with these earlier studies, underscoring that
methodological success is inseparable from interpretability and evaluation rigor in banking contexts
(Olowe et al., 2024).

Figure 12: Fraud Detection Research Trends Analysis

The finding that hybrid models integrating supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches
yield superior performance reflects and extends prior observations in fraud detection literature. AlSagri
(2025) demonstrated that hybrid frameworks reduce false positives while increasing recall, a conclusion
echoed by Malik et al. (2022), who reported that ensemble hybrids balance sensitivity and specificity in
large-scale deployments. The 19 hybrid-focused studies in this review confirm Carcillo et al.(2021)’s
assertion  that  combining  paradigms  is  necessary  to  address  the  evolving  tactics  of  fraudsters.
Compared with earlier reviews, which acknowledged hybrid potential but provided limited empirical
validation, the present findings show that hybrid models are now widely implemented and empirically
validated.  This  evolution  in  research  confirms  Carcillo  et  al.  (2021)’s  claim  that  hybridization  is  not
merely a theoretical proposition but a practical solution increasingly adopted by banks. The literature
thus  supports  the  conclusion  that  hybrid  models  represent  a  convergent  strategy  uniting  multiple
paradigms under operational constraints (Ebinezer & Krishna, 2025).
Another critical finding of this review concerns the integration of fraud detection models into banking
ecosystems,  particularly  regarding  deployment,  interoperability,  and  organizational  adaptation.
Earlier  studies  by  Kumar  et  al.  (2025)  recognized  that  deployment  challenges,  including  real-time
processing constraints and legacy system interoperability, often limit the impact of advanced models.
The  reviewed  literature  confirms  that  these  challenges  persist,  with  institutions  adopting  strategies
such as shadow deployment, model risk governance, and canary testing to ensure stable integration.
The workforce adaptation issues noted in this review, such as the transition from rules-based cues to
probability-ranked queues, build upon Razzaq and Shah (2025), who highlighted analyst retraining as
essential for adoption. Thus, the integration challenges identified here reaffirm earlier concerns, while
also  showing  progress  in  establishing  structured  governance  frameworks  for  model  validation  and
monitoring (Gorle & Panigrahi, 2024).
The  comparative  insights  across  regions—PSD2-driven  Europe,  fintech-led  North  America,  and
infrastructure-focused  emerging  economies—reveal  that  contextual  differences  strongly  shape
methodological  adoption.  Earlier  reviews  rarely  engaged  in  detailed  cross-regional  comparisons,
though  Mienye  and  Jere  (2024)  hinted  at  regulatory  and  infrastructural  factors  influencing  fraud

56

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

detection. This study extends those observations by showing how regulatory mandates such as PSD2
in  Europe  or  API-driven  ecosystems  in  North  America  directly  affect  feature  engineering,
interpretability,  and  deployment  strategies.  Moreover,  the  finding  that  theoretical  frameworks  lag
behind empirical advances echoes, who argued that criminological theories like the fraud triangle are
underutilized in computational modeling. The absence of standardized theoretical integration across
regions  highlights  a  gap  first  identified  by  Choi  et  al.  (2021)  and  still  unresolved  today.  Thus,  this
review  confirms  earlier  claims  about  fragmentation  in  theoretical  grounding  while  extending  the
evidence by systematically mapping regional variations (Pai et al., 2011).
CONCLUSION
This  systematic  review  has  synthesized  evidence  from  118  studies  to  provide  a  comprehensive
understanding  of  how  machine  learning  paradigms  are  shaping  fraud  detection  in  digital  banking,
highlighting the methodological diversity, operational constraints, and regional variations that define
the field. The analysis demonstrates that while supervised learning methods remain the most dominant
and widely adopted due to their interpretability and proven accuracy, unsupervised anomaly detection
and hybrid approaches have gained prominence as essential complements for identifying novel and
evolving fraud patterns. Deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural
networks, have emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data and
uncovering complex patterns, although challenges of explainability and deployment continue to limit
their widespread adoption in regulated financial environments. The findings further underscore that
evaluation  metrics  such  as  precision,  recall,  F1-score,  and  PR-AUC,  along  with  interpretability
frameworks like SHAP and LIME, are indispensable for ensuring that fraud detection models are not
only  statistically  robust  but  also  operationally  accountable.  Cross-regional  insights  reveal  that
regulatory,  infrastructural,  and  institutional  contexts  profoundly  shape  methodological  choices:  the
European Union emphasizes compliance under PSD2 and GDPR, North America prioritizes fintech-
driven innovation with strong model risk governance, and emerging economies highlight the role of
infrastructure and governance capacity in enabling effective fraud detection. Importantly, the review
identifies  methodological  gaps—including  inconsistent  handling  of  class  imbalance,  limited
reproducibility,  and  insufficient  robustness  checks—as  well  as  theoretical  gaps,  such  as  the
underutilization of criminological and governance frameworks in guiding computational modeling. By
systematically  mapping  the  evolution  of  fraud  detection  research  and  situating  it  within  broader
institutional and regulatory landscapes, this study provides a synthesized foundation for advancing
both academic inquiry and practical application in safeguarding digital banking ecosystems against the
persistent and evolving threat of financial fraud.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the synthesis of 118 reviewed studies and the comparative discussion across methodological
and  regional  dimensions,  several  recommendations  emerge  for  researchers,  practitioners,  and
policymakers  engaged  in  fraud  detection  in  digital  banking.  First,  researchers  should  prioritize
methodological  rigor  by  systematically  addressing  the  challenges  of  class  imbalance  and  dataset
scarcity.  Techniques  such  as  advanced  oversampling,  cost-sensitive  learning,  and  synthetic  data
generation should be evaluated in consistent benchmarking environments to improve reproducibility
and external validity. Second, more emphasis must be placed on integrating explainability into fraud
detection models. While accuracy is important, the adoption of interpretable frameworks such as SHAP
and LIME, alongside transparent feature engineering practices, will ensure compliance with regulatory
expectations and foster greater trust among financial institutions and customers. Third, practitioners
should  invest  in  hybrid  fraud  detection  systems  that  combine  supervised,  unsupervised,  and  deep
learning  methods,  since  the  evidence  shows  these  integrated  approaches  provide  the  most  reliable
balance  between  precision  and  recall  while  adapting  to  evolving  fraud  typologies.  Fourth,  banking
institutions must align deployment strategies with organizational readiness by implementing phased
rollouts,  shadow  testing,  and  robust  model  risk  governance  processes.  Training  and  reskilling
programs  for  fraud  analysts  should  be  prioritized  so  that  workforce  adaptation  keeps  pace  with
increasingly  complex  machine  learning  models.  Fifth,  policymakers  and  regulators  should  foster
greater  cross-border  collaboration  to  harmonize  fraud  reporting,  dataset  sharing,  and  regulatory
compliance, particularly to address the globalized nature of fraud networks. The experience of PSD2

57

ASRC Procedia: Global Perspectives in Science and Scholarship, May 2023, 37–61

in Europe, fintech-driven innovation in North America, and infrastructure-based strategies in emerging
economies  illustrates  that  regulatory  environments  profoundly  shape  model  design  and  adoption.
Finally, future research agendas should bridge theoretical and empirical gaps by linking criminological
frameworks  and  enterprise  risk  theories  to  computational  modeling,  ensuring  that  fraud  detection
evolves not only as a technical challenge but also as an interdisciplinary field grounded in behavioral,
institutional,  and  governance  perspectives.  Collectively,  these  recommendations  aim  to  strengthen
fraud detection ecosystems by combining methodological innovation, organizational adaptation, and
regulatory alignment.

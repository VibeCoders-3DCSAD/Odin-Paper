Abstract: Machine learning forecasting methods are compared to more traditional para-
metric statistical models. This comparison is carried out regarding a number of different
situations and settings. A survey of the most used parametric models is given. Machine
learning methods, such as convolutional networks, TCNs, LSTM, transformers, random
forest, and gradient boosting, are briefly presented. The practical performance of the
various methods is analyzed by discussing the results of the Makridakis forecasting com-
petitions (M1–M6). I also look at probability forecasting via GARCH-type modeling for
integer time series and continuous models. Furthermore, I briefly comment on entropy as a
volatility measure. Cointegration and panels are mentioned. The paper ends with a section
on weather forecasting and the potential of machine learning methods in such a context,
including the very recent GraphCast and GenCast forecasts.

1. Introductory Remarks

To be able to succeed in time series forecasting, a repeated past pattern is needed,
and that pattern has to continue into the future to some extent. The higher the regularity
of this pattern, the higher its expected forecastability. In other words, the higher the
disorder is in the history of the time series, the more difficult it is to predict. The disorder
of a time series can be formally measured in terms of its entropy (approximate entropy
and sample entropy), e.g., see Ref. [1]. The concept of entropy comes from the field of
physics. In information theory, the Shannon interpretation of entropy is used to measure the
amounts of information required to accurately send and receive some messages (e.g., see
the explanation and gedanken experiment in [2]). In data analysis, the concept of entropy
has been used to analyze patterns in medical data, such as heart rate; later, this spread to
applications in physiology, finance, climate sciences, and a number of other phenomena.
In practice, the entropy in a forecasting situation is seldomly computed explicitly, but it is
indirectly reflected in the uncertainty of a time series forecast. Uncertainty can be given
in terms of a probability interval, a confidence interval, or, in more detail, as a forecast
distribution, which attaches probabilities and distributions to a variety of predicted values.
Even though a forecast is often just given by a point forecast, which may be interpreted as
the most likely value of a time series variable at a future time, it seems to be increasingly
common nowadays to let the point forecast be accompanied by a measure of uncertainty.
This, in a sense, can be thought of as reflecting the entropy of the series. It is explained in
more detail at the end of Section 5.2. A few more comments on entropy and forecastability
are also given in Section 4.4 on forecasting competitions.

The history of time series forecasting goes very far back, at least to the age of antiquity,
with more or less accurate predictions of astronomic events and future weather. Presently,
forecasts are used virtually everywhere, ranging from, say, economics and opinion polls to
long- and short-term weather forecasts. Some forecasts are more or less purely statistical
in nature, i.e., demand forecasting for groups of items based entirely and exclusively on
past sales, but other types of forecasts, such as financial predictions, are aided by economic
theory, whereas weather forecasting may depend critically on a geophysical theory of
the atmosphere.

At present, forecasting is helped by an enormous increase in the availability of data.
Ours is truly the age of Big Data. However, how can this help us to make better predictions?
Is it easier or more difficult to see patterns in the data that can be exploited in forecasting?
In parallel with the increase in data, there has been an increase in the availability and speed
of computers. Computers can certainly detect patterns in complex data that humans or
more simple analyzing techniques cannot detect. There are machine learning (hereafter
denoted ML) techniques for handling such patterns, but are they useful for forecasting? Or
does the computer see patterns in the noise and, in that way, make misleading forecasts?
I will treat these questions in this paper. It is a review where I seek to include very
recent contributions. I emphasize attempts to find an answer and to pinpoint situations
where ML does particularly well or where it does not work so well. A frequent criticism
of machine learning is that it is a black box method. Nevertheless, can something be said
when it comes to finding reasons for it doing well in some situations, e.g., beating simple
parametric models, and not so well in other situations, where it is beaten by other types of
models? See the discussion in Section 4.3 and at the end of Section 6.

What is the potential for ML methods in the future? Are these methods improving
in quality while parametric models are at a standstill? Moreover, how well can purely
algorithmic ML methods be integrated into models to a large degree based on physics and
non-statistical features, such as in weather forecasting?

Partially, I try to give my review a somewhat personal touch. It is colored by my
research background, which has not been focused directly on forecasting but has been
centered on topics close to the problem of forecasting. Hence, I will discuss nonstationarity
and the patterns of nonstationarity that are statistically forecastable, such as cointegration.
This has also led to looking at leading lags and Granger causality, as outlined in [3].
In addition, I will mention the possible potential of local Gaussian models presented
in [4,5]. Further, I briefly look at GARCH-like structures, not only in volatility prediction
for financial series, but in integer time series modeling, so-called Poisson autoregression,
and similar recursive schemes for continuous time data described by stochastic differential
equations leading to the connection with Hawkes processes. There seem to be only limited
applications of ML methods in these contexts.

To compare individual forecasting methods and types of methods is a challenging task.
What kind of criteria or metrics should be used? A number of forecasting competitions
have been arranged, and I report on some of the main ones in Section 4.4. In most of
these competitions, forecasting accuracy has been used as a yardstick, but then several
measures of accuracy exist, and the ranking of methods may depend on the measure used.
However, clearly, there are other key metrics in judging forecasting algorithms, such as
training time, interpretability, and robustness against noisy data. I will briefly discuss each
of these criteria for the methods treated in the present paper.

Here is an outline of the paper: In Section 2, I mention the Holt-Winters models, which,
in many ways, may be said to have started modern applied forecasting. These models
are intuitive, provide good results, and are still used. A related, so-called “θ-model”, has
been doing well in forecasting competitions. Actually, this model was declared the winner

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

of the M3 forecasting competition; see [6]. The well-known ARIMA models, also briefly
discussed in Section 2, are related to the Holt-Winters models. Both point forecasts and
interval forecasts can be provided in the Gaussian case in particular.

All of these models are linear (and quite often Gaussian). Section 3 is devoted to

simple nonlinear parametric models and to nonparametric forecasting.

Section 4 is, in some sense, the main part of the paper. Here, I discuss the various types
of ML forecasts, such as those based on neural networks and random forest, which are pos-
sibly the two main contenders for simpler statistical models. What are their strengths and
weaknesses? How and when can they be strengthened further by combining various ML
forecasts with classic statistical models? How well do they do in forecasting competitions
(covered in Section 4.4) compared to more traditional methods? Further, parametric models
can be analyzed theoretically. How about ML methods?

Section 5 continues the discussion of ML methods. I treat multivariate time series and
panels, nonstationary effects, and cointegration as an alternative instrument to differencing
and removing deterministic trends. Further, I discuss forecasting distributions, including
scores, forecasting count time series via GARCH-type structures, and analogs in continu-
ous time with potential applications in multivariate financial forecasting and contagion.
For some of these problems, ML methods seem less well developed than in forecasting
stationary one-dimensional series.

Finally, in Section 6, I look at weather forecasting. Recently, ML methods have been
introduced at various stages of the forecasting process, sometimes eminently successful
but at other times, a failure. What is the future of ML forecasting here? This is discussed in
light of the very recent ML methods of GraphCast and GenCast.

I do not give any explicit forecasting examples using my own real data. For a great
number of such examples, I refer, instead, to the discussion and references in Section 4.4.

2. Classical Parametric Forecasts

The earliest forecasting technique that is still being used is probably the exponential
smoothing technique based on work in [7,8]. Exponential smoothing is an example of a
recursive scheme, with such schemes being extensively used in increasingly complex forms
in modern nonlinear and ML forecasting. The basic idea goes back to at least Poisson as an
extension of a numerical analysis technique from the 17th century, and it was later adopted
by the signal-filtering processing community in the 1940s.

Let {yt} be a time series for which predictions ˆyt+1 at time t + 1 are sought. Then, the

simplest form of an exponential smoothing forecast is given by

ˆyt+1 = αyt + (1 − α) ˆyt.

(1)

By solving recursively, ˆyt+1 is expressed as an exponentially weighted average of the
previous observations of {yt}, from which the appellation exponential smoothing is derived.
The parameter α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) must be estimated, usually using least squares, and the initial
value ˆy0 must be stipulated by, for example, taking an average of the early values of {yt},
which are needed for starting the recursive scheme.

Simple exponential smoothing does not work well if there is a trend involved. In-
cluding an (instantaneous) trend estimate, { ˆdt}, results in a double exponential smooth-
ing scheme:

ˆyt+1 = αyt + (1 − α) ˆyt + ˆdt

ˆdt+1 = β( ˆyt+1 − ˆyt) + (1 − β) ˆdt

(2)

(3)

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

4 of 34

where α is the data smoothing factor, and β (0 ≤ β ≤ 1) is the trend smoothing factor.
These factors and the initial conditions can be determined as indicated above for the simple
scheme in (1). The inclusion of a trend also makes it easier to forecast several steps ahead.
With the help of a student (Peter Winters), Holt extended the scheme further to contain
seasonal indices, the Holt-Winters forecasts, involving triple exponential smoothing. See
also [9]. Exponential smoothing can be extended to multivariate time series; see [10].

Probably the most well-known class of parametric time series is the class of ARIMA
(integrated autoregressive moving average) models. The major breakthrough of this class
of models came in the form of a book [11]. The authors introduced, in a time series context,
the classical sequence of statistical modeling: identification, estimation, and diagnostic
checking. The ARIMA models are so well-known that it seems unnecessary to say much
about them here, but a few facts will be mentioned for completeness. The simplest member
of this class is the purely recursive autoregressive model (the models are assumed to have
a zero mean),

yt = a1yt−1 + · · · + apyt−p + et,

(4)

where a1, . . . , ap are unknown parameters in a pth-order model, and {et} is a series of
uncorrelated (in inference, these are often assumed to be iid (independent identically dis-
tributed)) variables. The process is stationary if the roots of the characteristic polynomial
A(z) = 1 − a1z − · · · − apzp are located outside the unit circle in the z-plane. The one-
step-ahead forecast is given by ˆyt+1 = a1yt + · · · + apyt−p+1, and higher-order forecasts
are given by reiterating this equation. The estimation of the parameters is carried out
using maximum likelihood or quasi-maximum likelihood, and the asymptotic confidence
intervals and asymptotic distribution of the forecasts are easily established under weak
regularity conditions. The order is determined by inspecting the so-called partial autocorre-
lation function or by using an AIC-type criterion.

The class of ARMA(p,q) models is formed by replacing the noise or innovation term et

with a moving average term, resulting in

yt − a1yt−1 − · · · − apyt−p = et + b1et−1 + · · · + bqet−q.

(5)

It is somewhat more cumbersome to obtain parameter estimates and one-step or multi-
step forecasts using maximum likelihood or quasi-maximum likelihood, but standard
computer packages are available, where forecast confidence intervals are computed.

ARMA models can be further extended to encompass nonstationary models with a
linear stochastic or deterministic trend. This is carried out by reducing the series to a sta-
tionary series by differencing the observations up to d times, resulting in an ARIMA(p,d,q)
model. Often, d = 1 is sufficient. The models can be extended by including a seasonal
component that, in itself, can be modeled by an ARIMA-type process. In the vector time
series case, the ARIMA is based on the individual differencing of the component series,
but presently, this structure is predominantly replaced by a cointegration approach; this
will be briefly mentioned at the end of Section 5.3.

Forecasts can be computed using uncertainty intervals from standard statistical pack-
ages. The ARIMA models have tended to do well in forecasting competitions. They have
been compared to Holt-Winters exponential models, but it is not correct that these models
are merely a subset of ARIMA models; this is because Holt-Winters models contain instan-
taneous estimates of trends and seasonal components. These quantities are recursively
updated in time, which is not the case for ARIMA models.

The ARIMA models are easily updated to multivariate series {yt} by replacing the
scalar parameters a1, . . . , ap and b1, . . . , bq with matrices. The identification, estimation, and
validation steps are more complex. A useful reference is [12]. There are several program

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

5 of 34

packages for more or less automatically processing multivariate ARIMA models (see, e.g., a
Python 3.13 package on forecasting for ARIMA models and more general machine learning
forecasts regarding multivariate time series). These models can also be allowed to contain a
possible moving average exogenous variable, xt, in addition to the multivariate innovation
term et. These are the so-called ARIMAX models. Again, forecasts with uncertainty
intervals can be obtained from program packages.

The winner of the Makridakis M3 [6] forecasting competition was a forecast obtained
using the so-called θ (theta) method. The method was introduced in [13]. It is much more
completely described in the monograph [14]. It can be seen as a generalization of Holt-
Winters-type models. The choice of weight parameters and the numbers of trend functions
(and their nature) has been researched extensively; this is reflected in, e.g., Ref. [15], in a
comparison with machine learning forecasts.

In the general literature on theta models, there are two strands. The first one gives
probabilistic properties of the method, starting in [16]; subsequently, a number of theo-
retical results was collected in [14]. The latter provides a complete analysis of the theta
method under a unit root-generating process, explaining its success in the M3 Makridakis
competition in 2000 [6]. The authors of Ref. [14] also introduced the multivariate theta
method and looked at its relationship to cointegration.

The second strand expands and details various implementations of the method, opti-
mizing theta models and pointing out their relationship with state space models (see [17]).
A recent generalization of the theta method is given in [18]. Connections to adaptive

learning forecasts were pursued in [19].

The connection of the theta method to the perhaps more well-known class of state space
models prompts a short mention of the structure of the latter. In fact, state space models
are very powerful and versatile tools for working with time series and their forecasting.
They were initially developed by engineers but have been widely adopted and extended
among other applications to econometrics. Two central textbooks are [20,21]. State space
models are formulated by means of two different equations: an equation in terms of the
states, {αt}, which are a set of variables that are usually unobserved. Typical examples are
trends, seasonal components, or time-varying parameters. The state equation describes
the dynamic law governing the states for two adjacent points in time. The second is
the observation equation, which specifies the relationship between observed data and
unobserved states. A linear Gaussian version of such a system could look like this:

αt+1 = Ttαt + Γt + Rtηt,

ηt ∼ N (0, Qt)

yt = Etαt + Dt + Ctεt

εt ∼ N (0, Ht)

(6)

(7)

with the initial condition α1 ∼ N (α0, P0). In these equations, ηt and εt are the state and
observational vectors of zero-mean Gaussian noises. The matrices Tt, Γt, Rt, Qt, Et, Dt, Ct,
and Ht are the so-called (generally time-varying) system matrices, and α1 and P1 are the
initial state and state covariance matrix, respectively.

Once such a system is fully specified, the core problem is to provide optimal predic-
tions of states and their covariances over time. This can be carried out by looking back in
time using the well-known Kalman filter.

Given any set of data and a specific model, the system is not fully specified in most
cases because this would depend on unknown parameter matrices. An estimation of such
parameters is sought, carried out using maximum likelihood defined by prediction error
decomposition [20].

A more recent text book is [22]. The forecasting aspect is covered in, e.g., Ref. [23].

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

Concerning the key metrics mentioned in the Introduction, the classical parametric
forecasting methods reported in the present section must be said to be easy to interpret,
possibly with the exception of the theta-type models; see [15,24] for a simplification and
rephrasing of the model in terms of more understandable terms. The training of the
parametric models consists of estimating the parameters. This is very simply carried out
for univariate models, whereas high-dimensional ARIMA models and state space models
would require more effort. Usually, parametric models would contain a safeguard against
overfitting by using an AIC-type criterion or a penalty factor, thus limiting the number of
allowed parameters. Classical parametric models have high accuracy for forecasting in
linear models, but it is not difficult to find nonlinear models where they fail completely.

3. Nonlinear and Nonparametric Forecasts

Up to now, I have been mostly concerned with linear and often Gaussian models.
A claim of the ML methods is that (at least sometimes) they are capable of handling
nonlinearities better than classical parametric models. This means that, in a sense, ML
methods try to capture more of the probabilistic structure of the data. In comparison,
ARIMA models are based solely on statistical moments, e.g., the covariance structure.
This is fine if the data are Gaussian, but in the non-Gaussian case, one would expect that
information may have been lost.

Before I go over to the main theme of this paper—the construction of ML methods,
including their claimed ability to handle nonlinearities in a better way—it is instructive
to take a look at classical parametric nonlinear models, including a look at the classical
nonparametric methodology.

To make things simple, I concentrate on the first-order scalar model, where only one

lag is included. Going from model to forecast is then trivial.

The most popular nonlinear model is probably the threshold model introduced in [25].

In its simplest form, it is given by

yt = θ1yt−1{st−1 ≤ c} + θ2yt−1{st−1 > c} + et.

(8)

The process moves as a mixture of two autoregressive regimes, with autoregressive
coefficients θ1 and θ2, respectively. The regime is determined by the state process, {st},
and a threshold, c. When st−1 ≤ c, it moves according to θ1 when st−1 > c according to θ2.
The state process, st, may be equal to yt−d for a certain delay, d. An inference theory for the
threshold process is given in [26].

There are numerous generalizations and applications of the threshold model; see, e.g.,
Refs. [27,28]. Usually, a threshold process is assumed to be stationary. For a nonstationary
cointegration-type threshold process, see [29]. For a recent paper that covers the use of
thresholds in neural networks, see [30].

The threshold model is sometimes criticized, perhaps especially in econometrics, for its
abrupt change between regimes. There is a class of models with continuous transition
between the θ1 and θ2 regimes, the so-called STAR models (smooth transition models).
In the LSTAR model, the transition is modeled by a logistic function,

yt = (θ1 + θ2G(γ, c, st−1))yt−1 + et

with G having the logistic form

G(γ, c, st−1) = (1 + exp{−γ(st−1 − c)})−1, γ > 0.

(9)

(10)

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

7 of 34

Alternatively, an exponential form, ESTAR, can be used:

G(γ, c, st−1) = 1 − exp{−γ(st−1 − c)2} γ > 0.

(11)

An earlier version of these models was introduced in [31]. Later, the author of Ref. [32]
defined a family of STAR models that included both the LSTAR and ESTAR models and
devised a data-driven strategy with the aim of, among other things, helping the user choose
between these two alternatives. A number of generalizations of the simple models (10)
and (11) exist. An update can be found in [33].

The last class of parametric nonlinear models is the hidden Markov chain autoregres-
sive process. In contrast, for the threshold models and the STAR models, the state process
is typically given by st = yt−d, a delay of the observed process, in the hidden Markov chain
autoregressive process. {st} is a Markov chain so that

yt = st−1yt−1 + et,

where, in the simplest case, st, can only take two values, θ1 and θ2, say, and where st varies
between these two values according to a 2 × 2 Markov transition matrix. Both θ1 and θ2
and the entries in the probability transition matrix are unknown and have to be estimated.
The EM algorithm is often used for this task [34]. Additionally, the mean and variance of
the series could be the subject of Markov regime shifts [35]; see the more recent textbook
reference also [36].

For all of these classes of processes, it is possible to do asymptotic inference on the
parameters, and asymptotic confidence intervals can be secured under certain regularity
conditions. In principle, these can be transferred to asymptotic uncertainty intervals for the
forecasts. However, it seems more difficult to produce a distributional theory of forecasts,
unlike the nonparametric models examined next.

The well-known kernel density estimate for the marginal density, p(y), of a stationary

time series, {yt}, given n observations y1, . . . , yn, is given by

ˆp(y) =

n
∑
t=1

Kh(yt − y),

where K(·) is a kernel function, h is the bandwidth, and Kh(·) = h−1K(h−1(·)). Un-
der nonrestrictive conditions, consistency and asymptotic normality can be proved. It is
well-known that the optimal (with respect to least squares deviation) predictor ˆyt+1 is given
by the conditional mean of yt+1, given the past value. The conditional mean m(yt+1|y) of
yt+1 given yt = y can be estimated using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator

ˆm(yt+1|yt = y) =

∑s≤t ysKh(ys−1 − y)
∑s≤t Kh(ys − y)

.

This will also be an estimate of the optimal predictor if the past of yt+1 can be represented
by yt, e.g., in the possibly nonlinear autoregressive AR(1) case yt+1 = g(yt) + et for some
function, g. In the case of the AR(p) process with yt+1 = g(yt, . . . , yt−p) + et, the function g
can be estimated, and consequently, yt+1 can be forecasted, but one quickly runs into the
curse of dimensionality as p increases.

To avoid the curse of dimensionality, one can use an additive model, where it is

assumed that g(y1, . . . , yp) = g1(y1) + · · · + gp(yp), resulting in a model:

yt+1 = g1(yt) + · · · + gp(yt−p) + et

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

8 of 34

for some component functions, g1, . . . , gp. The model can be estimated by so-called back-
fitting, which is thoroughly explained in [37]. There are extensions to models with mild
forms of interactions between the components; see, e.g., Ref. [38]. The relevant variables
can be selected by using the lasso routine, as explained in [39].

The conditional mean forecast is optimal in the least squares error sense, but it should
be noted that there are alternative measures of error for forecasting, which are, in fact, often
used as error measures in comparing forecasts and forecasting competitions. The most
used are the mean absolute error (MAE) minimized by the median and mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). For a discussion of these and related topics, I refer the reader
to [40].

Nonlinear parametric models certainly have an advantage if the data are nonlinearly
generated, but, of course, they lose out to linear models if the data are linearly generated.
In general, the danger of overfitting increases with nonlinear models, as can be seen with
far worse examples of out-of-sample forecasts. The training (estimating of parameters)
naturally takes longer due to the more involved estimation algorithms. These may be
iterative, and it is not always obvious when the iteration should be stopped. Often, when
they are regression-type models, they are usually not difficult to interpret.

The nonparametric forecasting algorithms are based on estimating the conditional
mean and are, therefore, easy to interpret. Their scalability is a problem due to the curse of
dimensionality but can partly be avoided using simplifications such as additive models.

4. Machine Learning Forecasts

As emphasized in the Introduction, to be able to make forecasts, it is necessary that an
observed pattern has features that are preserved in time when moving into the forecasting
period. Since we are dealing with time series, this seems to require some kind of stationarity
in the series. However, the strictness or wide-sense stationarity of the series is not an
absolute prerequisite. Multivariate time series may be nonstationary; nevertheless, it may
be possible to forecast if there is a time-invariant pattern governing the nonstationarity,
for example, via cointegration, where there is one or more time-invariant linear combination
of the series, which results in a (possibly) multivariate stationary time series.

For a univariate time series, there could be a linear stochastic trend, which may be
removed by differencing, or there could be a possibly nonlinear deterministic trend, which
may be removed by a regression device. Moreover, heterogeneity may be removed using
a Box-Cox-type transformation [41]. In a local Gaussian approach, further analysis is
facilitated by transforming the series into a Gaussian series; see [4].

A Gaussian AR series is the series that is easiest to handle regarding prediction;
everything is based on the autocorrelation function, and the optimal least squares forecast,
the conditional mean, is linear and can be expressed in terms of the autocorrelation function,
which, in turn, gives a complete description of the probability structure in the Gaussian case.
A key aspect of the autoregressive process is its recursive definition, where forecasts
can be obtained easily by regressing using the series itself, and forecasts with a more
distant time horizon can be built up recursively. The recursive property can also be built
up for the ARMA and ARIMA series and, as seen in Section 2, for exponential smoothing
models using Equations (2) and (3). The recursive mechanism can also be extended to
seasonal forecasts.

For nonparametric and nonlinear forecasts, similar but more complicated recursive

mechanisms may, in many cases, be relied on.

Common to all of these mechanisms and a prerequisite for them to work well is a
training period, where the model is built up by identification, estimation, and diagnostic
checking, not only in the ARIMA case but also for the exponential smoothing models. In the

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

9 of 34

training period, the parameters need to be estimated, and this is similar when regarding
nonlinear parametric models. The nonparametric method does not contain parameters as
such, but the number of lags and the bandwidth need to be determined.

For machine learning methods to be dealt with regarding this section, the training is
absolutely essential and is, in many ways, the central concept of the methodology; this is
not only used for forecasting; it is used in general when finding a pattern that describes the
data and where this pattern can be recognized and used in the analysis when new data are
coming in. There are several ways of doing this, but I will concentrate on two methods:
neural network analysis and random forest, which seem to have been the most successful
machine learning (ML) forecasting methods.

4.1. Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Networks

Neural networks are used for a number of problems in prediction, classification, and
clustering. The success and impact of neural network-like approaches in machine learning
have recently been recognized by the 2024 Nobel Physics Prize awarded to John Hopfield
and Geoffery Hinton. Currently, there is intense activity in this field, not the least in so-
called deep neural network modeling. These are networks with several hidden layers.
A detailed survey of developments up to 2015 is given in [42].

I start with a single-layer network. Assume a given data vector, x, which may be
thought of as a section of a time series, {y1, . . . , yt}. In a neural network approach, one
is interested in transforming x via linear combinations of its components and a nonlinear
activation function, often of sigmoidal form, of the linear combinations. These linear
transformations represent what is called a hidden layer.

The first step in constructing the hidden layer is to form linear combinations:

hi = w0 +

n
∑
j=1

wijxj

and then possibly subject these terms to an activation function. In the case of just one
hidden layer, an output layer in terms of the hidden layer is given by

zi =

m
∑
j=1

w

′
ijhj

followed by another possibly nonlinear function, depending on the problem. It has been
shown, e.g., Ref. [43], that this system of linear combinations and activation functions
is able to approximate general classes of functions. In a s-step time series forecasting
problem, the output may successively be built up to obtain the forecast ˆyt+s at step s
from the input set {y1, . . . , yt}. When using a training set, the weights wij and w
ij are
determined by minimizing a loss function involving (yt+s, ˆyt+s), where ˆyt+s is based on the
output layer. The error function is evaluated for each of the samples coming in the input
window. Subsequently, the output of the gradient of the error function with respect to yt+s
is evaluated, and the weights are recomputed and updated in the direction of the gradient
using stochastic gradient descent. The weights w
ij for the output layer are computed first.
Then, wij is adjusted via the chain differentiation rule using so-called backpropagation.

The simple, one-hidden-layer forward scheme has met with considerable success.
Applications such as the embedding of graphs and text processing are described in [44],
with emphasis on the work carried out in [45,46]. However, it has turned out that in
many problems, including forecasting, improved performance can be obtained using deep,
multiple-layer networks, where the learning process is called deep learning.

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

A prime advantage of deep learning is that hidden units can be connected to each other
recursively in time. This is taken up among several other sources in the literature in [47].
They consider a somewhat extended multivariate, one-step-ahead forecast framework,
where for component i,

ˆyi,t+1 = f (yi,t:p, xi,t:q, si)

(12)

where yi,t:p = {yi,t, . . . , yi,t−p}, and xi,t:q = {xi,t, . . . , xi,t−q} are exogenous variables of
component i over the look-back window of length p; si represents static meta-data, e.g., the
location of a meteorological station, for climate data. The function f is the prediction
function learned by the model. It contains weight functions and hidden units of the hidden
layers, which, as will be seen below, can be chosen in various ways.

Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and (TCNs): Convolution neural networks
(CNNs) [48] were originally designed for spatial data; however, they have been adapted
to a time series situation. For an intermediate layer, l, each convolution is a causal filter.
In terms of hidden vector units, it takes the form

hℓ
t = A((w ⋆ h)(ℓ, t))

(13)

with the convolution between weights and hidden units given by

(w ⋆ h)(ℓ, t) =

p
∑
τ=0

w(ℓ, τ)hℓ

t−τ.

In (13), hℓ
at layer ℓ. The function A is an activation function, e.g., a sigmoidal function.

t is an intermediate state at layer ℓ, and w is a fixed matrix of convolution weights

In a time series context, convolution neural networks are often named temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs). The contrast with the spatial CNNs mainly consists of
their focus on the data types and the structure of their convolutional layers. In particular,
TCNs employ temporal and dilated convolutions to capture more long-range dependencies
and complex temporal patterns, whereas CNNs use spatial convolutions to detect local
patterns and features in images.

A basic TCN publication is [49], which is concerned with action segmentation in
computer vision. The TCN algorithm has been compared to other recurrent networks like
RNN and LSTM, which will be treated next. An advantage of TCNs is that, due to the
parallel nature of the convolutions, they can train faster and more efficiently than LSTMs.
Examples of comparisons of forecasting potential for TCN, RNN, and LSTM are [50,51].
The outcome of these investigations and similar experiments is that TCNs can compete on
par with RNN and LSTM, but this somewhat depends on the data type.

A single, causal CNN layer is equivalent to an autoregressive model.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) do not require
an explicit fixed look-back window, as is the case for CNNs. Given the natural interpretation
of time series forecasts as sequences of inputs and targets, many applications for temporal
time series prediction have been developed [52–54]. At their core, RNN cell units contain an
internal memory state, which acts as a compact memory of past information. The memory
state is recursively updated from new observations at each time step.

Recurrent neural networks were originally based on workin the 1980s. Since then,
a number of different RNN architectures have been developed. Just to give a flavor of
these networks, I present the model equations for the three-layer (one hidden layer) Elman
network. They are

ht = σh(Whxt + Uhht−1 + bh),

zt = σz(Wzht + bz)

(14)

(15)

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

11 of 34

where xt is an input vector, ht is a hidden layer vector, zt is an output vector, W and U
are parameter matrices, b is a parameter vector, and σh and σz are activation functions.
Equations (14) and (15) show the recursive structure of the network.

The Elman network and the similar Jordan network are known to be simple recurrent
networks (SRNs). There exist considerably more complicated recurrent networks with a
number of layers than in CNN networks, but the idea of recursion in time is kept.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks: The long-term gradients that
are backpropagated in classic RNNs can tend to zero or explode. The problem is compu-
tational. The so-called long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network is designed to
counter this problem. LSTM units practically solve the vanishing gradient problem because
LSTM units allow gradients to flow unchanged. LSTM can still sometimes suffer from the
exploding gradient problem.

The vanishing gradient problem was first analyzed in a diploma thesis by Sepp Hochre-
iter at the Technological University of München under the guidance of Sepp Schmidhuber.
After having been published as a technical report and as a conference proceeding, the full
LSTM paper appeared in 1997 in Neural Computation [55]. Since then, there have been
substantial and applied advances regarding the method. Now, the original LSTM paper
stands with a hefty count of more than 67,000 citations. The paper has become the most
cited neural network article of the 20th century, and it has been applied with consider-
able success to topics such as unsegmented, connected handwriting, speech recognition,
machine translation, robot control, video games, and healthcare. LSTM is particularly
well-suited to classifying, processing, and making predictions of time series data since there
can be lags of unknown duration between important events in time series.

A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell unit, an input gate, an output gate, and a
forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals, and the three gates
regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.

Transformers: In 2017, a paper with the endearing title “Attention is all you need” [56]
was published. “Attention” is here a technical machine learning term referring to a method
that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the
other components in that sequence. The term has its origin in natural language processing,
with the importance being represented by assigning weights to each word in a sentence
(more generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width
sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size). The title of the [56] paper
refers to the fact that the authors were able to do away with the recursive structure of
machine learning methods like RNN and LSTM and build on language processing concepts
instead. This meant that parallelization could be implemented with enormous savings
in processing time and could also be said to lay the foundation for artificial intelligence
routines like ChatGPT.

The methodology presented in [56] has recently had a very big impact. This model of a
neural network that learns context and, thus, meaning in sequential data, like the words in
a sentence, has been named the transformer model (with the added fact that transformers
can use parallel processing to increase speed). Transformers are, in many cases, replacing
convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) as the most popular deep
learning models. Indeed, 70 percent of arXiv papers on AI posted in the last two years
mention transformers. One example of further development of an aspect of transformer
methodology is [57].

The technology is, in principle, valid for any sequence of data, including time series
and molecular sequences and their application in medicine, leading to a large growth in use
in a number of fields. The structure of transformers also allows them to be able to model
long-range dependence [58]; see [59].

I will return to transformer forecasting in the section on weather forecasting—Section 6.

4.2. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting

Random forest and gradient boosting seem to be the main ML competitors to neu-
ral network-based models in forecasting. Both of these methods can be used both for
classification and prediction. They are described well in chapters 10, 15, and 16 in [60].
Both of these methods are random tree methods and use bootstrap realizations efficiently
to form new trees. Random forest uses averages of forecasts generated by independent
bootstrap-generated trees and can be run in parallel. Gradient boosting runs sequentially,
where the new tree model is sought to correct the errors of the previous one.

The procedure of random forest is a special case of a bagging procedure, where
a final predictor or classifier is obtained by using the average of predictors/classifiers
obtained by bootstrapping the original data and creating a regression tree and a forecast
for each bootstrap realization. A block bootstrap has to be used in time series forecasting.
The advantage of this “ensemble averaging” lies in the possible variance reduction in taking
averages. The variance reduction is largest if the bootstrapped trees are independent. In the
random forest algorithm, one tries to reduce dependence by using a random mechanism in
the growth of each bootstrap tree.

For forecasting purposes, the tree structure used is regression trees. The range of the
explanatory variables is randomly split into regions (sequentially) in time; when the tree
is fully grown, the predicted value for each sub-region (possibly obtained using several
splits) is given by a constant determined by a least squares algorithm on the training set for
each bootstrap realization of the data. The final predicted value for a given value, x, of the
explanatory variables is then obtained by taking the average of the regionalized values for
the regions x belongs to for the various bootstrapped trees. Since the bootstrap realizations
can be run and worked on in parallel, efficient computation time may not be too long, even
for a large number of bootstraps.

Where the point of random forest is variance reduction, the purpose of gradient
boosting is more directed towards bias reduction. Again, the aim is to obtain suitable
regression trees. However, in this case, the bootstrap realizations are not just run in parallel.
Now, a regression tree is sought by correcting the prediction error in the training period
of the previous regression tree. This is a sequential procedure, and it is continued until
the entire validation part of the training data set is accurately predicted or a predefined
maximum number of models is reached. During this process, the weight of the original data
points is changed so that points that are incorrectly predicted are given more weight. In this
way, an adaptive boosting procedure is constructed. The authors of Ref. [61] developed
the first version of AdaBoost, and they received the prestigious 2003 Gödel prize for their
work. Compared to random forest, the results of gradient boosting are more sensitive to
parameter settings during training. However, using the correct parameter settings, the user
expects to obtain better test results than random forest.

The sequential procedure involved in gradient boosting may make the procedure
impractical if a large set of data with many bootstrap generations is involved. Approximate
methods and more time-efficient algorithms, e.g., the so-called light-GBM, have been
suggested; see, in particular, [62].

4.3. XAI

There are a number of reports on the general scalability of machine learning algorithms;
see, e.g., Ref. [63]. The same is the case for the order of training times required; a table is
given in [64].

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

13 of 34

There are other ML methods that can be applied to forecasting: support vector ma-
chines, ridge regression, and the lasso process. The latter includes regularization terms to
avoid overfitting. It is claimed that an ensemble method like random forest itself avoids
overfitting by using the ensemble operation. Much more details can be found in [60].
A brief overview of the overfitting problem is contained in [65].

As is mentioned repeatedly in this paper, the largest problem of machine learning
methods is their black box nature. Both neural network and random forest prediction
algorithms produce forecasts, but they are not simply expressible in terms of the input
variables (features) of the model. It is understandable that skepticism arises towards
machine learning when it is difficult to understand or (intuitively) explain how each
feature contributes to the model. The situation is very different from forecasts formed from
generalized linear regression models, where one can find a natural measure of how each
input variable contributes to the forecast. Is it possible to find similar measures for the
contribution of each input feature in a machine learning context?

Work on this problem has actually started and has, in fact, spawned a whole new
discipline: “Explainable artificial intelligence”, XAI, where the aim is to “explain” black
box models. A recent survey of this field is given in [66], where the problem is discussed
broadly and partly from a philosophical point of view. There are also papers devoted to this
problem in special research areas, e.g., opening the black box in applications in genetics,
such as in [67], where three general techniques are being used to probe the kinds of changes
in the output are being caused by the alternative weighting of structures in the model.
Sensitivity analysis can be used to examine the effects of modifying the input features.
The model in [68], which is treated in Section 5.3, was tested by undergoing such sensitivity
analyses. A final strategy mentioned in [67] is the surrogate strategy, where the black box
model is sought to be replaced by a simpler, more interpretable model, which still provides
a good approximation.

There are also techniques that seek to attribute a concrete value to the importance of
each input feature, thus constituting, in a sense, a generalization of the importance measure
of each input variable in a generalized linear regression model. The most used technique
is probably the SHAP value, which is related to the Shapley value in competitive games.
The Shapley value was introduced by Lloyd Shapley in 1951, see [69], for which he was
later awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. To put this into our present context (as in [70]),
let F be the set of all features. The Shapley method, in principle, requires retraining a model
on all feature subsets, S ⊆ F. The method assigns an importance value to each feature, i,
that represents the effect of the model prediction of including that feature. To compute this
effect for the ith feature, a model, fS∪i, is trained with that feature present, and another
model, fS, is trained with the feature withheld. These predictions from the two models
are compared to the current input forming the difference fS∪i(xS∪i) − fS(xS), where xS
represents the values of the input features in the set S. Since the effect of withholding a
feature depends on the other features in the model, the preceding differences are computed
for all possible subsets, S ⊆ F − i. The Shapley values are then computed and used as
feature attributions (importance). They are weighted averages of all possible differences

ϕi = ∑
S⊆F−i

|S|!(F − |S| − 1)!
F!

[ fS∪i(xS∪i) − f (xs)]

where |S| is the number of elements in S.

In [70] (also see [71]), the Shapley values are integrated in an additive regression-type
framework to create SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations). This framework also
serves as a common framework for five other explanation models, with LIME (local inter-
pretable model-agnostic explanations) described in [72] among them. Some stability issues

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

14 of 34

are highlighted in [73]. Based on the unification attained in [70], the authors indicate that
the new methods show improved computational performance and/or better consistency
with human intuition than previous approaches. As an example among numerous appli-
cations of SHAP in explaining machine learning models, real hospital data are examined
in [74].

It should be remarked that the above examples mark only the beginning of the problem
of opening the black box for machine learning models. A rather critical evaluation of XAI
is contained in [75]. Moreover, rather limited attention has been given to this issue in the
forecasting competitions treated in the next subsection. One reason for this is probably due
to the rather late appearance of XAI methods. There is surely a need for competitions that
compare XAI possibilities for various models.

4.4. Statistical vs. ML Methods: Evidence from Forecasting Competitions

A number of forecasting competitions have been arranged to find the “best” forecasts
and to evaluate statistical forecasts against ML forecasts and simple models vs. more
complicated ones. Spyros Makridakis, in particular, has organized a number of forecasting
competitions, starting in 1982 with the M1 competition and then continuing with the
M2–M6 competitions, with the results published in 1982, 1993, 2000, 2020, 2022, and 2024
(see below for exact references). The scope has been somewhat varied, and so has the
number of participants and the number and versions of methods represented. For the most
recent ones, major ML and statistical methods have been included. In the M1 competition,
the number of time series sought to be predicted was 1001; in M3, it was 3003, and
in M4, it was 100,000. A history of forecasting competitions up to 2020 is given in [76].
The forecasting competitions described by the forecast organizers themselves can be found
in [6,77–81].

The general tendency in the course of these competitions is that ML methods have
been more successful. In the first competition, simple statistical models of the exponential
smoothing type did better than the more complex ARIMA models. In M3 in the year
2000, several ML methods did partake, but the winner was the theta method described
in Section 2, a relatively simple parametric extension of exponential smoothing -type
models. The M1–M3 competitions had a relatively small number of time series available
for prediction. The M4 competition represented a very significant extension, featuring
100,000 time series, and it is also (to date) the competition with the most general types of
series; it was also the first where prediction intervals were evaluated in addition to point
forecasts. It seems reasonable to give a brief review of that contest. The time series differed
in sampling frequency: yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, and hourly, with about half of
the series sampled on a monthly basis. The series was taken from the following areas:
business, economics, industry, demographics, education, labor and wages, government,
households, bonds, stocks, insurance, loans, real estate, transportation, natural resources,
and the environment. The sheer amount of time series and their spread is, of course,
commendable, but, at the same time, this could be discouraging for the competitors due
to the amount of labor required. There was also a relatively large number of dropouts
because the forecasting teams were discouraged when they compared their results to simple
benchmark forecasting methods supplied by the organizers. Nevertheless, 61 forecasting
methods ended up being represented.

The length of the time series varied considerably, with the minimum number of
observations in the training set being 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for
weekly, 93 for daily, and 700 for hourly series. However, on average, the length of the series
was much longer than the series in the M3 contest. The forecasts were evaluated in several

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

15 of 34

ways, mostly based on relative absolute deviation, with an average taken over forecasting
horizons, which varied from 3 for yearly data to 48 for hourly data.

The winner of the competition was Slake Small, a data scientist at Umber Technologies.
He mixed exponential smoothing-type models with RN recursive deep learning methods,
which are described in more detail in [82]. His hybrid method perhaps represented a
main result of the competition, namely the improved numerical accuracy of combining
forecasting methods and the superiority of a hybrid approach that utilizes both statistical
and ML features.

Combining has long been considered a useful practice in the forecasting literature,
going all the way back to the classical paper of [83] for purely statistical methods and
up to the ensemble methods for random forest and gradient boosting.
Intuitively, it
is understandable that the combining principle can lead to improvements, as different
methods pick up different forecasting potentials of the data, but the exact theory that
explains the improvement is more scarce; see, e.g., Ref. [84]. More specifically, for the M4
competition, there was only 1 pure point forecast statistical method among the top 10 most
accurate methods, while all of the 10 least accurate methods were either purely statistical
or purely ML. Similar results were obtained for interval forecasting.

It seems that most of the methods were applied to individual series, with only a few
attempts to exploit multiple series to extrapolate the individual ones. Similarly, exogenous
variables do not seem to have been used (possibly not the point of the competition and
perhaps not so easily available).

Another issue not dealt with by Makridakis et al. and by other similar contests is that
there was no emphasis on so-called black swans, i.e., in the evaluation of the forecasts, it
was not registered whether a forecasting method in some cases did disastrously badly; this
would be missed in an evaluation based on average performance over the series. The “black
swans” may, in some cases, be caused by thick-tailed distributions [85]. The organizers
remark that this phenomenon was outside the scope of the M4 competition but stated that
another forecast competition is needed for closer examination to analyze the implications
of black swans for risk management and decision-making.

A total of five ML methods, four pure and one combination of solely ML methods,
did not do well. These results were in agreement with [24]. However, it could be possible
that this is partly due to the ML methods used in the competition. For example, it does not
seem that the best-developed random forest or gradient boosting processes participated.
These types of criticism (partly pointed out by the organizers themselves) and some
additional ones are taken up in [86]. They refer to the results of a recent competition of
145,000 series on web traffic data run by the Kaggle corporation and hosted at about the
same time. The time series in the Kaggle data had a much higher spectral entropy (defined
by − (cid:82) π
−π f (λ) log f (λ)dλ, where f (λ) is the spectral density of the series). This means that
the series were noisier and more difficult to predict. Further, many more series had (much)
shorter time intervals between the samples. For the Makridakis data mentioned above,
the emphasis is on monthly data (48%), whereas only 0.4% were weekly, 4.2% daily, and
0.4% hourly.

In [86], Fry and Brundag state that at Google, as is the case with many other net-based
companies, there is an increasing degree of situations where one has to deal with short
time intervals, e.g., even 5 min intervals, and sometimes irregular time intervals. For these
data with higher spectral entropy, it has turned out that ML methods have been doing
increasingly well, and in [86], Fry and Brundage state that ML methods have, in fact, been a
game-changer for this kind of forecast. At the same time, they reiterate that more emphasis
should be put on multivariate and hierarchies of time series, as well as on predicting

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

16 of 34

extreme events. They state that perhaps more attention should be put on predicting higher
quantiles in a forecast distribution than on producing a single-point forecast.

Perhaps as a reaction to this, a new M5 forecast competition was launched [80], which
focused on retail sales forecasting applications and used real-life hierarchically structured
sales data with intermittent and erratic characteristics. The competition attracted many
participants who were eager to experiment with effective forecasting solutions in real-life
situations faced by numerous retail companies on a daily basis. Many of the series in
the competition were characterized by intermittency, involving sporadic unit sales with
many zeroes.

The data set used comprised the unit sales of 3049 products sold by Walmart in the
USA. The data were organized in the form of grouped time series aggregated based on
their type (category and department) and selling locations (stores and states), with a total
of 42,480 series in 12 cross-sectional aggregation levels. As a performance measure, a scaled
least squares criterion averaged over several forecasting horizons was used.

Again, simple methods like exponential smoothing did fairly well. However, this
time, they were clearly beaten by the best ML methods. The light-GBM version of gradient
boosting mentioned in Section 4.2 turned out to have superior forecasting capabilities
compared to all other alternatives, and it was used in practice by all of the 50 competitors.
This is consistent with the claim of [86] regarding the superiority of ML methods for
this and similar types of series. Somewhat curiously, the first prize was won by a senior
undergraduate at Kung Hee University of South Korea with the team appellation YJ.STU.
He used an equal-weighted average of various light-GBM algorithms.

The most recent of the Makridakis forecasting competitions is M6 [81]. Participants
were asked to forecast 100 financial assets and to make corresponding financial investments.
Surprisingly, there was virtually no correlation between the best forecasts and the best
investment decisions; it turned out to be very difficult to beat the standard S&P market
index. The authors do warn that the participants to a limited degree carried out the study
according to the intentions of the organizers. It was intended that the competitions should
have 12 non-overlapping submission periods, with each 28 days after the previous one.
As a result, the competition lasted for almost one year. However, only a small percentage
of the teams updated their forecast regularly during the duration of the competition. Many
teams simply submitted once or twice at the very beginning of the competition. Again,
a winning team was directed by a graduate student.

It is satisfying that ML techniques have the potential to obtain better forecasts, and they
do increase the tool box of forecasters. However, there are reasons for some reservations
and criticisms directed towards ML methods. A primary reason, as mentioned, is that
they are black box forecasts based on pattern recognition of data types. Some attempts,
see, e.g., Ref. [68] (who obtain their best results using random forest routines), have been
made to look into this by comparing particular cases of benchmark forecasts, changing
the parameters of an ML forecast, and seeking to explain the corresponding changes in
the forecasts. See Section 5.3 for further mentions of this paper. Basically, ML methods
are not immediately interpretable, as e.g., an AR time series model; however, as indicated
in Section 4.3, attempts to open the black box have started to emerge. Moreover, another
distinct difference is the lack of theoretical results on the asymptotics of ML methods.
The beginning of theoretical development may be represented in [87].

Summing up, regarding the results from the Makridakis competitions and other similar
competitions like the Kaggle competitions, there seems to be a definite trend where the
ML forecasts are improving, and at least, in some areas as those with high spectral entropy
are superior to statistical forecasts. However, limitations of these competitions, other than
the black box criticism of ML methods, have been pointed out. For example, they have

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

17 of 34

essentially been carried out for univariate series. They started out by using more or less
pure point forecasts. Interval prediction has been increasingly included, but there is still a
lack of clear results on forecasting distributions and extreme quantiles. Moreover, there
is a lack of systematically evaluating multivariate forecasts, the influence of exogenous
variables, and the effect of nonstationarity on multivariate systems. The next section will
be devoted to some of these themes.

5. ML vs. Statistical Models in Some Other Situations

Based on the contents and criticisms of the Makridakis competitions, it can be stated
that they do not constitute a complete coverage of all aspects of the forecasting problem.
In this section, I will look briefly and somewhat unsystematically at some of the missing
aspects. Each of these subject areas would benefit from a systematic study in a framework
of M-type forecast competitions. Ordinary statistical models seem to still dominate in these
areas, but there has been some recent work on ML methods.

5.1. Probability Forecast

Sometimes, one is not satisfied with an interval for measuring forecast error and
would like more detailed information in terms of forecast distribution. This is easily
obtained for a linear Gaussian model, e.g., an AR(p) model, as defined in (4), where the
forecast distribution is obtained as N (a1yt−1 + · · · + apyt−p, σ2
e is the variance
in the error process {et}. Similar reasoning can be put forward for an additive model
with a Gaussian error process. In a more general situation for a multivariate series {yt},
in principle, kernel estimates can be used to obtain estimates of the conditional distribution

e ), where σ2

p(yt+1|(yt, . . . , yt−p)) =

p(yt+1, yt, . . . , yt−p)
p(yt, . . . + yt−p)

(16)

but the curse of dimensionality comes into play for moderate dimensions of {y} and for
moderate orders, p. In addition, the denominator may be close to zero in the estimates of
the tail, which may cause instability.

A possible alternative may be to use local Gaussian estimates, as detailed in [4],
in particular, chapters 9 and 10 on local Gaussian density and conditional density estimation;
see also [88].

A very recent conditional probability model coupled with the theory of diffusion
processes has recently obtained very good results in weather forecasting; see the end of
Section 6.

In dealing with forecast distributions, one meets the fundamental problem of how to
compare them. When is one distribution significantly better than another? This problem is
equally valid for point forecasts and has been discussed in the classical paper [89]. They
introduce a process for testing whether one predictor is significantly better than another.
The authors of Ref. [90] treat a similar problem for probability forecasts.

Actually, Gneiting and colleagues have discussed a number of fundamental questions
related to probability forecasting; see, e.g., the editorial [91] by Gneiting and [92]. In par-
ticular, he and his coauthors examine the process of forecasting extreme events [93] and
combining probability forecasts in [94].

The ML literature on probabilistic forecasting is more sparse. One relatively recent
contribution is [95]. The authors concentrate on finding forecasts of quantiles, which is a
very relevant expression of the probability distribution, perhaps in economics and finance
in particular. Several versions of a DeepAR quantile estimate have done well compared to
more traditional benchmark estimates when compared to those forwarded already in [96].

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

18 of 34

A spline approach coupled with an RNN, see Section 4.1, is advocated in [97], whereas

the authors of [98] use a copula approach.

5.2. Volatility Forecasting and a Machine Learning Example

Volatility is an all-important concept in the analysis of financial risk. Rob Engle
received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to this field, in particular, in [99,100]. The re-
sulting models are the ARCH/GARCH models, which are now well represented in any
textbook in econometrics. The GARCH model for the instantaneous conditional variance
σ2
t is given by

σ2
t = ω +

αiεt−i +

βjσ2

t−j

p
∑
i=1

q
∑
j=1

where ω is a constant term, and {εt} is the heteroscedastic error term. There are many
specialized versions of the GARCH model, e.g., EGARCH, that take care of the leverage
effect of volatility,

log σ2

t = ω +

p
∑
i=1

(αiεt−i + γi(|ε|t−i − E|εt−i|)) +

q
∑
j=1

βj log σ2

t−j

where the new parameter γi captures the asymmetric impact of news with negative shocks.
An alternative class of volatility models is the so-called SV (Stochastic volatility) models;
see, e.g., Ref. [101].

The increased use of high-frequency data has led to the introduction of a new instanta-
neous variance concept: realized volatility. High-frequency data can really be looked at as a
process where events take place continuously in time. A simple model for the price process
Pit for a financial asset i is given by

d log Pit = µi + σitdWt

where µi is the drift, σit is the instantaneous volatility, and Wt is the standard Brownian
motion. In practice, a discrete approximation is used. The mid-price return for asset i
during the time interval (t − 1, t] is considered given by

rit = log

(cid:16) Pit
Pi,t−1

Refs. [102,103] argued that the sum of squared intraday returns is a consistent estimator
of the unobservable theoretical integrated variance, (cid:82) t
isds, where h is the look-back
horizon, such as 10 min, 30 min, 1 day, etc. The realized volatility can be based on the
logarithm (to reduce the impact of extreme values). Ref. [104] specifically defined the
following during a period (t − h, t]:

Previously, forecasting volatility was based on parametric models. Very recently, the
authors of [105] used ML methods and set up a simple forecasting comparison between
several models. Among other things, they based themselves on (17) but with a 1 min return
interval. Ref. [105] argues that, generally speaking, there are two broad families of models
used to forecast daily volatility: (i) GARCH and SV models that employ daily returns and
(ii) models that use daily RVs. Previous well-established studies have shown that due to the
utilization of available intraday information, daily RV is a superior proxy for unobserved

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

daily volatility when compared to the parametric volatility measures generated from the
GARCH and SV models of daily returns [103,106,107].

Two questions can be asked. It has been observed that in asset markets, there seems
to be a common intraday structure that is shared among the volatility of the assets. It is
termed commonality. The first question is, can intraday commonality structure be utilized
in improving volatility forecasts? The second question has to do with the main theme
of the present paper: Can forecasts based on parametric models be improved upon by
ML methods?

Both questions are considered in [105] in their handling of data. They use a data set
composed of the top 100 components for the S&P index for the period between 1 July 2011
and 30 June 2021. After filtering away the shares for which data did not exist for the entire
period, 93 stocks were kept. The average realized volatility commonality for the market is

and because a measure of the commonality is used, the R2 value of the regression is

RV

(h)
it = αi + βiRV

(h)
M,t + εit

which is inspired by prior studies, as in [108,109].

The data were subjected to a number of methods, both parametric and ML, and the

outcomes were compared for a one-data set volatility forecasting competition.

The two questions were treated for a number of models for instantaneous volatility
and its development in time. Among the models included were seasonal ARIMA, HAR
models (cf. [110]), ordinary least squares, least absolute shrinkage, XGBoost (essentially a
gradient boost technique, as described before in Section 4.2), multilayer perceptron (MLP)
(a multilayer feedforward neural network), and long short-term memory (this is the LSTM
modeling routine described earlier).

For these models, and with the data set divided into a training period and a validation
period, an extensive data analysis and comparison was carried out. Consistent with the
M5 competition, the ML methods, in particular, the neural network-based methods MLP
and LSTM, gave the best volatility forecasts. Moreover, for most models, taking advantage
of the commonality information leads to better forecasts. Finally, contrary to the M6
competition, the forecasting evidence seems to be consistent with the results obtained in
constructing investment portfolios based on forecasts. Much more detail and a number
of related references can be found in [105]. It should also be mentioned that in the study
of forecasting the volatility of cryptocurrencies [111], it was found that forecasts can be
improved by combining GARCH-type models with ML forecasts.

As remarked upon in Sections 1 and 4.4, an alternative measure of uncertainty of data
is given by entropy. In the Kaggle competition referred to in Section 4.4, the importance of
the entropy measure was stressed. The use of entropy in financial time series (also pointing
out the relationship to volatility) has been mentioned in several recent publications.

In [112], structural entropy is introduced, and the new measure and volatility are
remarkably correlated for an asset price series; see also [113,114]. Related to [111] is [115],
and both deal with cryptocurrency. Finally, Ref. [116] used entropy in the description of
sudden shocks, whereas [2] studied entropy-corrected geometric Brownian motion.

5.3. Multivariate Forecasts, Including Exogenous Variables, Panels, and Cointegration

While multivariate ML methods have crept up relatively recently, multivariate data
and models have been used for a long time in multivariate statistical analysis. The vector
autoregressive model, VAR, is

yt = A1yt−1 + · · · + Apyt−p + et

(18)

where {yt} is a vector data process, Ai, i = 1, . . . , p are autoregressive matrices, and {et} is
a vector innovation process; this has been used extensively in econometrics, finance, and
other fields. This pure autoregressive model may be complemented by a set of exogenous
variables {xt}, resulting in the VARX model. Such multivariate models were largely not
present in the Makridakis competitions, but clearly, they can be important in forecasting.
If there is dependence between the components of a vector process, the intuitive use of the
dependency information should lead to improved forecasts of the individual series.

So, are there any systematic forecasting exercises where classical autoregressive-type
models are compared with ML methods? It seems that, thus far, as for the volatility
case, there are only specific examples of such comparisons, and these mostly pertain to
a situation where a single variable time series, {yt}, depends on q explanatory variables,
{x1t}, . . . , {xqt}. One such example that gives a good illustration is [68], where forecasting
the inflation of the US consumer price index was studied. The possible drivers of infla-
tion are taken from the so-called FRED-MB database, which is a large monthly database
designed for analysis in data-rich environments. The data period is from January 1960 to
December 2015, with 672 monthly observations. There are 122 explanatory variables. All
variables were transformed to achieve stationarity.

The benchmark models include univariate autoregressive, random walk, and unob-
served component stochastic volatility models. A number of other models, including ML
models, were tried. Forecasts were computed for 3-, 6-, and 12-month horizons. The au-
thors found that, overall, random forest outperformed the other methods (it does not seem
that the LSTM algorithm was included in the study, though). As mentioned in Section 4.4,
the authors attempted to obtain more insight into the black box constituting random forest
in this case.

An example where LSTM does well compared to other methods in multivariate time
series forecasting is in [117]. The LSTM method is extended with a so-called attention
mechanism (see Section 4.1) for the general use of the attention mechanism under the
description of transformers. However, random forest-type forecasts were not included in
the application of forecasting to solar energy data, among other things.

An example of the use of explanatory variables regarding the climate is presented
in [118]. Temperatures in five Chinese cities were sought to be explained using dew
point temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, and cumulative wind speed data. In a
comparison with the lasso method and ordinary least squares, LSTM methods performed
best. Random forest and gradient boosting methods were not included.

Finally, Ref. [119] is a paper on the prediction of soil movement, where multivariate
methods did better than univariate versions, and LSTM-type forecasts were outperformed
by general parametric statistical models like seasonal AR models. There seem to be rela-
tively few data samples in this investigation.

In case there are many time series, panel models are traditionally used instead of VAR

models. A quite general linear panel model can be stated as

yit = αi + µt + β

′

ixit + uit

(19)

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

21 of 34

where yit is the dependent variable for member i of the panel at time t, with 1 ≤ i ≤ N and
1 ≤ t ≤ T, and where the apostrophe (’) stands for transposed. Moreover, xit is a vector
of explanatory variables, for which the influence on yit is determined by the coefficient
vector βi. The scalars αi and µt are specific panel member and time effects, respectively.
Finally, uit is a residual term. The parameters αi, µt, and βi may be deterministic (fixed
effect) or random.

Model (19) is sometimes termed a static panel, whereas the term dynamic panel is

reserved for the model

yit = αi + µt + aiyi,t−1 + β

′

ixit + uit

(20)

with an explicit dependence on past y-s. Of course, both models may be generalized to
contain higher-order time lags for the y and x variables. A panel may also be unbalanced,
where the number of observations, T, may be allowed to depend on i, T = Ti, but I will not
be concerned with these generalizations. Actually, I will introduce several restrictions of (19)
and (20). First, one or more of the terms in these equations may be omitted. Second, if the
parameters are not allowed to depend on i, the panel is said to be homogeneous, whereas
dependence on i leads to a heterogeneous panel. In the latter case, it is simplest to treat the
case where the parameters are random and have the same distribution for each i. Often,
independence over i is added as an extra assumption, and the task of estimation may be
reduced to simply estimating the mean of the parameters. In general, averaging techniques
can be used for handling heterogeneous effects, while differencing and cointegration (see
below) may represent instruments for treating nonstationary effects.

The theory of panels has concentrated quite a lot on inference in parametric models.
However, the potential use of panels in forecasting is obvious. A recent survey of panel
forecasting using relatively traditional linear panel models is given in [120].

Nonlinear models do exist, and recently, neural networks have been included in
the modeling of nonlinearities; see [121]. The authors find significant forecasting gains
regarding feedforward neural networks when compared to linear panels and nonlinear
time series models when examining predictive power for new COVID-19 cases. They
were also able to find some of the asymptotic properties of their method using arguments
originally developed in [87].

For several forecasting methods, there is no special device for taking care of nonstation-
arity. For traditional multivariate ARIMA models, however, individual differencing of the
components was the favorite tool; this has also been used for panels. With the introduction
of cointegration models, this has changed, and an initial step would consist of looking for
(linear) cointegrating relationships; the cointegrating VAR model could be restated as a
so-called error correction model.

Let {yt} be a vector of time series variables that are (individually) of the I(1) class; i.e.,
they can be made stationary using differencing. Then, by reparametrizing, one obtains the
VECM (vector error correction model)

∆yt = αβ

where the matrices α and β have a cointegration framework interpretation of Equation (18),
k−1 and Φ are coefficient matrices; µ is a coefficient vector, dt is a vector
and Γ
containing the stationary, I(0), variables, and εt is a process of residual terms often assumed
in the model to be iid normally distributed. See, e.g., Refs. [122,123].

Is it possible to couple ML methods with the concept of cointegration? An example
of this can be seen in [124]. Their first step is to include a nonlinear term in the error-
correcting model, for example, a STAR model, as introduced in Section 3. Then, the linear
part is subtracted from the full model, and the nonlinear part is sought to be re-estimated

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

22 of 34

using random forest. In this way, a mixed random forest cointegration model is obtained.
The model is applied to weekly forecasts of a gasoline price process cointegrated with
international oil prices and exchange rates. This mixed model provided better forecasts
than a purely parametric model.

It should be mentioned that deep learning forecasts have also been used in portfolio

construction for cointegrated stocks. The interested reader is referred to [125].

5.4. GARCH-Type Schemes for Integer and Continuous Time Series

Lately, there has been an increasing interest in integer time series. These are time series
consisting of counts with a low number in each time period, so a continuous approximation
of the counts does not work well.

There are two main classes of integer time series models: the INAR class and the
INGARCH model.
In the INAR model, a convolution trick is used to obtain integer
time series that follows an AR model. In the INGARCH model, a recursion is used on
a parameter of an integer-based distribution. The use of ML methods for both classes is
very limited (to my knowledge). A recent article for INAR fuzzy series is [126]. Negative
binomial likelihood analysis with ML was briefly mentioned in [52]; see also [127].

Here, I will place emphasis on INGARCH models due to their many generalizations
to multivariate models and continuous time models with connections to so-called Hawkes
processes and multivariate time series in finance. The most straightforward INGARCH
model is Poisson autoregression. Earlier attempts are represented, mainly using second-
order theory, in [128] and, more recently, in [129]. A more thorough introduction to inference
theory and ergodicity is given in [130], focusing on Poisson autoregression.

Let {yt} be an integer time series, and let F y,λ

be the σ-algebra generated by {ys, s ≤
t, λ0}. Here, {λt} is the time-varying random intensity of a Poisson process {yt}. The
first-order Poisson autoregressive model is given by the following GARCH-like recursion:

t

yt|F y,λ

t−1 ∼ Poisson(λt) λt = d + aλt−1 + byt−1

(22)

where d, a, and b are the parameters to be estimated. Probabilistic properties and an
asymptotic theory are established in [130]. It is obvious how forecasts can be developed in
this scheme, and forecasts were used in tests of fitting financial data in [130].

A number of generalizations have been developed to cover higher-order models and
nonlinear models, like threshold and exponential autoregressive considerations. Further,
logarithmic intensity, alternative integer distributions, like the negative binomial in the
recursive scheme, and multivariate cases have been examined. Some selected references
can be found in [131]. Again, to my knowledge, machine learning methods have not yet
been used much, although one could easily think of situations where such an approach
could be useful, in particular, for high-dimensional and nonlinear integer time processes.
A generalization to continuous time regarding the GARCH-like structure can be found
in [132,133] for self-excited jump processes. Let {Tn} denote the times of events in a point
process. We introduce the counting process associated with the point process,

N(t) = ∑
Tn≤t

1Tn≤t

which counts the number of events up to time t. The corresponding σ algebra is F N
,
t
generated by {N(s), 0 ≤ s ≤ t}. A stochastic intensity process, {λt}, corresponding to (22)
can now be generated using a GARCH-like stochastic differential equation:

dλt = α(λ0 − λ(t))dt + βdN(t).

(23)

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

23 of 34

The model in (23) can be extended to the multivariate case, where one component may excite
another component. Applications to financial data are presented in [133]. The authors also
briefly discuss nonlinear models of this type. In the linear case, the models generated by re-
cursion can be considered as a parsimonious form of Hawkes processes, where the intensity
is generated by a continuous moving average mechanism with λ(t) = (cid:82) g(t − s)dN(s) for
some function, g. These processes were originally introduced in the study of the intensity
of earthquakes but were later used in finance; see [134].

The question of predicting the intensity process is an actual one. It is, again, straight-
forward to use the recursive equation itself, but can machine learning methods be used?
Some ideas are presented in [135].

The intensity process in these applications replaces a time-varying parameter by using
a stochastic process. A quite general framework for time-varying parameters is developed
in [136]. The mechanism used to update the parameters over time is the scaled score of
the likelihood function. The authors remark that this approach provides a unified and
consistent framework for introducing time-varying parameters in a wide class of nonlinear
models, with the GARCH model, autoregressive conditional intensity cases, and types
of Poisson count models among them. Numerous follow-up papers have addressed the
application of such models to forecasting. A recent survey paper is [137]. I am not aware of
machine learning forecasts for this model.

In this section, our final recursive system will be a recursive system for a dynamic
network. With the increasing use of the internet and Big Data, the analysis of large networks
is becoming more and more important. There is a wide field of applications, which ranges
over such diverse areas as finance, medicine, and sociology, including criminal networks.
A broad overview can be found in a recent book [138]. More foundational problems are
covered in [139].

Both research and applications have been overwhelmingly concentrated on static
networks. However, a change seems to be taking place presently since the static assumption
is an untenable one in many practical cases. As time goes on, new nodes are added to the
network, others vanish, and the strength of the connection between nodes may be changed
or even severed. This realization has led to a rapid increase in interest in dynamic networks,
noted, for instance, in the last section of [140], where a substantial portion of the following
material is taken from.

A recent example of rigorous statistical modeling regarding a dynamic network is [141].
The authors modeled the network structure by using a network vector autoregressive
model. This model assumes that the response of each node at a given time point is a linear
combination of (a) its previous value, (b) the average of connected neighbors, (c) a set of
node-specific covariates, and (d) independent noise. More precisely, if n is the number of
nodes, let yit be the response collected from the ith subject (node) at time t. Further, assume
that a q-dimensional node-specific random vector xi = (xi1, . . . , xiq)′ ∈ Rq can be observed.
Then, the model for yit is given by

yit = β0 + x

′

iγ + β1n−1

i ∑

j̸=i

aijyj,t−1 + β2yi,t−1 + εit.

(24)

Here, ni = ∑j̸=i aij represents the total number of neighbors of the node, vi, associated with
yi, so it is the degree of vi. The term x
γ is the impact of covariates on node vi, whereas
n−1
∑j̸=i aijyj,t−1 is the average impact from the neighbors of vi. The term β2yi,t−1 denotes
i
the standard autoregressive impact. Finally, the error terms, {εit}, are assumed to be
independent of the covariates and are iid normally distributed.

′

There are a number of differences between the network vector autoregression modeled
using Equation (24) and a full dynamic network embedding. Even if the autoregressive

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

24 of 34

model does introduce some (stationary) dynamics in time, the parameters are static; i.e.,
no new nodes are allowed, and the relationship between them is also static, as modeled
by the matrix A = {aij}. From this point of view, as the authors of [141] are fully aware,
the model (24) is not realistic in terms of the dynamics that take place in practice for many
networks. On the other hand, the introduction of a stochastic model that can be analyzed
using traditional methods of inference is to be lauded. A worthwhile next step is to try to
combine more realistic models with a stochastic structure (e.g., regime-type models for the
parameters, as in [142]. The hope is that it will be amenable to statistical inference. Ref. [143]
treats dynamic networks with a fixed number of nodes but only where the dependence
between nodes is modeled by a doubly stochastic matrix.

For some very recent contributions to network autoregression, see [144] and the
references therein. In [145], the authors consider integer-valued network variables and
analyze linear and log-linear Poisson autoregressive networks. This is motivated by the
fact that many net variables take discrete values. In [146], nonlinear models and tests for
linearity are introduced.

An interesting recent publication is [147]; the authors study time series networks
for both integer and continuous-valued data. The nonlinearity is provided by a smooth
link function. The authors studied stability conditions for such multivariate systems and
developed quasi-maximum likelihood estimates when the dimension of the network was
increasing. They also develop linearity tests.

Again, forecasts can, in principle, be formed directly from the recursive equations. I
do not know of instances where the dynamic network model and ML have been applied to
the same data set.

6. Weather Forecasting

I will finish this paper by looking at a problem where the main thrust of the existing
forecasts depends on a (numerical) physical model, namely weather forecasting. What are
the interactions, if any, between this numerical physical model and ML techniques like
neural networks and random forest? Is it possible to completely do away with numerical
weather forecasting (NWP) and base a weather forecast entirely on ML? NWP is very time-
consuming and requires extensive computer resources. For the fastest and most effective
ML methods, one might think that there could be a gain in processing time, and, of course,
the hope is that, ultimately, ML may increase the accuracy of weather forecasting.

Manual NWP was first attempted in [148] in Britain in 1922, and early computer-aided
weather forecasts were produced in the 1950s by a group led by John von Neuman at
the Princeton Institute of Advanced Studies; see [149]. The early history is also outlined
in [150,151]. Modern weather prediction relies extensively on massive numerical simula-
tion systems that are routinely operated by national weather agencies all over the world.
Statistical analysis plays a major part in the stepwise procedure that NWP consists of.

In order to perform NWP, a variety of observations regarding atmosphere, land, and
ocean are collected all over the world, creating a global observation network, not the least
in terms of satellite measurements. Although millions of different direct and indirect
measurements are obtained each day, these raw data must be transformed and refined
before they can be input into the numerical weather model. This stage is called data
assimilation (DA). The data are then projected into a discrete model grid (interpolated in
time) and adjusted to be consistent in terms of state variables (e.g., temperature, pressure,
wind, etc.). DA also takes care of measurement errors, such as biases between different
spatial instruments. The obtained initial Earth system after the DA step constitutes an
optimized estimate of the real conditions, cf. [152].

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

25 of 34

Given these initial conditions, the core of the NWP model consists of numerically
solving the coupled partial differential system (the Navier-Stokes equations) describing the
atmosphere in terms of momentum, mass, and enthalpy.

The Navier-Stokes equations for fluid motion, v, underlying atmospheric flow are the

following, cf. [153], p. 14:

∇ · v = 0

ρ

(cid:16) ∂v
∂t

(cid:17)

+ v · ∇v

= −∇p + µ∇2v + ρg

(25)

(26)

where ρ is density, p is pressure, g is acceleration, and µ is a parameter. The Navier-
Stokes equations are accompanied by a set of thermodynamic equations that interrelate
temperature, pressure, and humidity within the atmosphere:

∂ρ
∂t

+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0

(Continuity equation)

+ v · ∇T =

q
cp

(Energy equation)

= −ρcp∇ · v (Pressure equation)

∂T
∂t

Dp
Dt

(27)

(28)

(29)

where T is the temperature, and cp is a pressure parameter. The resulting solution gives the
atmospheric state in each model grid cell.

This is very demanding computationally, and the solution can only be given over
a relatively coarse grid. A postprocessing stage (mainly statistical in nature, possibly
involving ML) is, therefore, needed to obtain data on a finer grid.

Over the past decades, the ability of NWP models to predict a future atmospheric
state has continuously improved. Contemporary global NWP models are not only able to
predict the synoptic-scale weather pattern for several days, but they have increased in their
ability to predict regional events such as, e.g., major precipitation events.

The increasing success of operational NWP models is due to improvements in all the
steps involved in the NWP workflow and the new capabilities (e.g., satellite measurements)
of the global Earth observation system. The NWP model improvements can, therefore,
be related in part to resolution enhancement. The continuous refinement of grid spacing
has also required reformulating the dynamical cores of the NWP models, where the dis-
cretized Navier-Stokes equations are solved. Simulating the atmosphere at the kilometer
scale brings with it the demand for highly parallelizable algorithms for the dynamical
core [154]. Simultaneously, remarkable progress has been achieved in designing discretiza-
tion approaches that enable the grid scale dynamics to follow the conservation laws of
energy, entropy, and mass. Such physical conservation laws may cause problems in a pure
ML approach. An extensive overview of contemporary dynamical core architecture and
spatio-temporal forecasting can be found in [155].

The general development of ML, spanning over much more than weather forecasting
and, in particular, of deep learning (DL), has had a history of advances and setbacks; see,
e.g., Ref. [156]. Nowadays, ML has seen several instances of success. Recent developments
are due to vastly increased computer capabilities, not the least due to massive parallel
processing. This is the case with, for example, TCNs and transformers, as reported in
Section 4.1. This has carried with it the hope that an ML system for weather forecasting
may be faster than the present NWP system, allowing for more efficient processing of very
large data sets. Finally, large benchmark data sets have become available on the internet.
As a result of this development, highly complex neural network systems with more than
106 parameters have enabled a breakthrough in image recognition, speech recognition,
gaming, and video analysis.

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

26 of 34

The weather and climate community is, of course, aware of the powerful advances in
ML. However, according to Ref. [156], there have still been reservations against ML methods,
possibly due to the black box nature of ML methods and also the lack of implementation
of physical conservation laws, as mentioned above; see [157]. Moreover, Ref. [158] argued
that traditional ML methods may not yet be fully suitable for Earth System data; they claim
that new network topologies are needed that not only exploit local neighborhoods (even at
different scales) but also long-range relationships, for example, significant relationships
or links between weather phenomena at widely separated locations on Earth, such as the
effects from the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)). It may be of interest that both TCNs
and transformers represent potential tools for modeling long-range relationships. See [159]
for an example of transformers being used in long-term forecasting.

For some time now, there have been a number of uses of ML methods, but these have
mainly been within more isolated parts of the weather prediction problem, such as the
preprocessing and postprocessing stages mentioned earlier. In the preprocessing stage,
ML methods can, for instance, be used in the interpolation of data to a regular grid. The
postprocessing techniques have been reviewed in several papers, such as [160,161].

One survey [160] discusses both the use of parametric statistical distributions and ML
methods. Distribution-based postprocessing approaches specify a parametric model for a
forecast distribution. The parameters of the forecast distributions are then linked to the
predictors from the NWP system via regression equations. Flexible additive regression
functions are suggested in [162]. Despite these powerful variants, the need to select a suit-
able parametric family to describe the distribution of a target variable remains a limitation
for parametric postprocessing methods and often necessitates elaborate fine-tuning.

When it comes to ML methods, random forest has been used in a variety of postpro-
cessing situations, see, e.g., Ref. [163]. One challenge is, again, the interpretability of ML
approaches. However, in weather forecasting, attempts have also been made to break open
the black box; see, e.g., Ref. [164], which reviews methods for deciding which predictors are
most important for a model and for a particular forecast. A more recent survey is contained
in [157]. The authors discuss applications of SHAP and LIME, as mentioned in Section 4.3,
to meteorological ML routines. They indicate how these interpretative aids may have the
potential to gain more insight into predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relation-
ships captured by machine learning. Further, they point out challenges around achieving
deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles. Refs. [165,166] should
also be mentioned.

In general, combining forecasts (also in postprocessing) has been considered. Ref. [167]
does this in the context of an ensemble Kalman filter. Again, one challenge regarding
blending forecasts is to maintain the realistic physical features of the NWP model. There is,
though, a clear shift [160] from physical modeling approaches to data-driven approaches.
This shift is perhaps particularly transparent for the recent method of transformers, as
discussed in Section 4.1.
In [168], a transformer-based neural network is used in the
postprocessing phase in predicting near-surface temperature, and in [169], hierarchical
transformers are used in the postprocessing of temperature and precipitation forecasts.
Moreover, transformers are used in precipitation nowcasting in [170].

These examples are restricted in that they are not full weather forecasts. This is also
the case with some TCN (again, see Section 4.1) applications. Ref. [171] used TCN and
LSTM for weather forecasting using time series data from local weather stations. TCN is
also an important component in [172] in a hybrid model for wind power forecasting.

Despite its publication in Annals of Applied Statistics, Ref. [161] represents a more
theoretical approach to postprocessing. The authors stress that accurate modeling of multi-
variate dependencies is crucial in many practical applications in general and, particularly,

Entropy 2025, 27, 279

27 of 34

in NWP. In several approaches to postprocessing, ensemble predictions are first postpro-
cessed separately in each margin, and multivariate dependencies are next established via
copulas. Ref. [161] proposes a multivariate postprocessing method based on generative
machine learning as an output of a general neural network to avoid some of the limitations
regarding the two-stage copula approach. This results in a new class of nonparametric
data-driven distributional regression models.

While this kind of postprocessing still requires a core of NWP or is restricted to one or
a few meteorological variables, simultaneously, intensive work has been going on to try
to establish a scheme of weather forecasts that are based entirely on statistical and/or ML
approaches. Very recently, there has been remarkable progress in this area, which may even
be a breakthrough.

The group behind this breakthrough is the Google Deep Mind group. They have taken
ideas from the mechanism of transformers and used them in a wider context. They are
extending the framework to graphs, which seems to be a more fitting model environment
for weather forecasts due to the observations (nodes) being scattered over space and with
dependence not only between neighboring points but also over larger distances referring
to long-range meteorological phenomena.

A gentle introduction to graph neural networks is given in [173]. The connection
between transformers and graph neural networks, with the former as a special case of the
latter, is described in a Graph Deep Learning Lab report [174].

The GraphCast module developed for weather forecasting by the Google Deep Mind
group is described in a Science 2023 article [175]; see also [176]. GraphCast is able to
make medium-range weather forecasts with unprecedented accuracy. According to the
authors, it predicts weather conditions up to 10 days in advance more accurately and much
faster (inherited from the fast transformer routine set-up) than the industry gold standard
weather simulation system—High Resolution Forecast (HRES) produced by the European
Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. GraphCast can also offer earlier warnings of
extreme weather events.

GraphCast makes forecasts at the high resolution of 0.25 degrees longitude/latitude
(28 km × 28 km at the equator). That is more than a million grid points covering the entire
surface of the Earth. At each gridpoint, the model predicts five Earth-surface variables—
including temperature, wind speed and direction, and mean sea level pressure—and six
atmospheric variables. GraphCast is autoregressive; it can be “rolled out” by feeding its
own predictions back in as input to generate an arbitrarily long trajectory of weather states.
The model was trained using 39 years (1979–2017) of historical data from existing
archives. A training objective was to average the mean squared errors between GraphCast’s
predicted states over a set of autoregressive steps and the corresponding data found in the
archives. Much more details can be found in the Science paper.

What makes the Google Deep Mind group especially impressive is that the group has
come up with another module that seems to be on the level of GraphCast, if not better. It is
described in a late 2024 Nature paper [177]. It uses the appellation GenCast and is based
on conditional probabilities, a form of conditional independence, using diffusion modeling.
It has the same resolution as GraphCast and roughly the same training period; it beats the
ENS model, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting,
in speed and accuracy in 97.2% of 1320 targets.

Do these advances mean that numerical weather prediction models can be discarded
in favor of machine learning methods? This is not a viewpoint held by scientists in this area.
In [178], GraphCast is critizised for its possible lack of physical consistency. Furthermore,
explainability, in spite of recent advances, is still an issue that needs further attention.

Rare events are hard to model due to the difficulty of having limited data during the
training period.

Can machine learning methods be extended to cover really long-range periods and
even give clues to possible climate modeling? This question is raised among others in a
Csiro report [179]. It is pointed out that while weather prediction is a “big-data” problem,
climate projections represent a “small-data” problem, with relatively little available data.
On the other hand, there seems to be every reason to continue the search for good
machine learning methods in weather prediction, not the least as an extremely valuable
(and fast) complement to numerical weather forecasting. Hybrid models of physical models
and AI models may be of special interest. In a recent Nature paper, the authors of Ref. [180]
discuss the possibility of coupling the physics of general circulation models with machine
learning models to obtain a hybrid model that may be able to produce useful simulations
of long-range weather or even climate processes. Similar arguments are used in [158].

Ref. [156] concludes that the research on pure ML methods in weather forecasting
is still in its infancy; the specific properties of weather data require the development of
new approaches beyond the classical concepts from computer vision, speech recognition,
and other typical ML tasks. The author’s conclusion is that there may be potential for
end-to-end (“pure”) ML weather forecast applications to produce equal or better quality
forecasts for specific end-user demands, especially if these systems can exploit small-scale
patterns in the observational data that are not resolved in the traditional NWP model chain.
Whether ML and DL will evolve enough to replace most or all of the current NWP systems
cannot be answered at this point. In any case, according to Ref. [158], one might argue for
more interaction between physical and deep learning systems.

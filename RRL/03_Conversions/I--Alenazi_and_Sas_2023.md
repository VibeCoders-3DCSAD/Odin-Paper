Financial  behaviour  is  deeply  embedded  in  our  lives,  yet  for  many  people  its  success  remains
problematic.  The  need  for  supporting  tools  in  this  space  is  reflected  in  the  growing  number  and
popularity of  budgeting apps, albeit limited research has focused on evaluating them. This paper
describes a functionality review from the lens of mental accounting theory of 45 top-rated budgeting
apps selected from 1335 apps on Google Play Store and Apple Store. Findings indicate that while all
apps support tracking of transactions, one third of the apps do not support budgeting informed by
money envelopes. We also report challenges regarding the meaning of key concepts of “accounts”
and  “transactions”  for  which  we  proposed  novel  design  implications  including  a  more  nuanced
vocabulary to talk about accounts and transaction types, new knowledge to have better support for
budgeting  through  mental  accounting  theory  and  grounding  budgeting  as  cognitive  process  in
actual financial behaviour.

INTRODUCTION

HCI research on money and financial practices  has
focused mostly on exploratory studies (Kaye et al.,
2014;  Vines,  Dunphy  and  Monk,  2014;  Snow  and
Vyas,  2015b;  Vyas  et  al.,  2016;  Lewis  and  Perry,
2019),  whose  findings  indicate  that  people  tend  to
use digital tools to a limited extent. As a result, we
have little understanding of how digital tools such as
mobile  apps  for  personal  budgeting  could  facilitate
the tracking and monitoring of financial behaviours
such  as
for  daily
tracking  and  budgeting
expenditures. In addition to mobile banking, financial
management  apps  supporting  users
track
expenses  and  create  budgets,  have  also
experienced rapid growth in the recent years as one
of  the  fastest  growing  categories  of  finance  apps
(Bitrián, Buil and Catalán, 2021). In 2018, the global
revenue for the such tools was over $1.4 million and
estimated  to  at  least  double  its  value  by  2025
(QYResearch,  no  date).    While  previous  HCI
research  has  explored  functionalities  of  publicly
available apps on marketplaces in domains such as
fitness  (Chung  et  al.,  2018),  diet  (Zaidan  and
Roehrer,  2016),  depression  (Qu  et  al.,  2020),
personal  goals  (Lolla  and  Sas,  2023)  or  digital
wellbeing  (Almoallim  and  Sas,  2022),  limited  such
work has looked at budgeting apps.

2.  BACKGROUND

Most HCI work on financial behaviour has focused
on  tracking  such  practices  for  individuals  (Kaye  et
al., 2014; Vines, Dunphy and Monk, 2014; Lewis and
Perry,  2019)  and  households  (Snow  and  Vyas,
2015b,  2015a;  Vyas  et  al.,  2015,  2016)  and  their
preferred  tools.  To  track  their  spending,  most  of
previous findings emphasize analogue tools such as
coin jars (Snow and Vyas, 2015a; Vyas et al., 2016),
enabling people to see how much they have spent.

Evaluating Budgeting Apps: Limited Support for Budgeting Compared to Tracking

In addition to coin jars, envelops  (Snow and Vyas,
2015a; Vyas et al., 2015) are also commonly used
budgeting  tools  for  monitoring  expenses  as  their
names  reflect  the  purpose  of  money  stored  in
specific  envelopes,  such  as  grocery  money.  There
have  been  other  common  analogue  tools  for
budgeting  and  tracking  spending,  such  as  wall
organizers,  bills  attached  to  refrigerators,  folders
and  handwritten  diaries  (Kaye  et  al.,  2014;  Snow
and Vyas, 2015b, 2015a; Vyas et al., 2015, 2016),
which are preferred due to their simplicity.

In contrast to such rich use of analogue tools, HCI
research has reported limited digital tools supporting
financial  practices  and  in  particular  of  budgeting
apps. For instance, Snow and Vyas’s study  (Snow
and  Vyas,  2015a)  showed  banking  apps  as  more
financial

participants having used budgeting apps which they
tend to discontinue after a short period of time due
to the perceived challenge of entering expense and
of  lack  of  adequate  control  over  their  spending.
Spreadsheets  were  another  common  tools  mostly
for tracking transactions (Kaye et al., 2014; Vyas et
al., 2016), rather than budgeting purposes. Despite
the  growing  HCI  interest  in  personal  finances,  we
have  seen  limited  theoretical  underpinning  of  such
work, especially from the lens of mental accounting
theory, although the value of behavioural economics
has  been  previously  suggested  (Stockinger  et  al.,
2013) for healthy choices (Lee, Kiesler and Forlizzi,
2011), digital wellbeing (Park, Lee and Park, 2021)
or retirement savings (Gunaratne and Nov, 2015).

To summarize, HCI research on financial practices
has highlighted mostly the use of analogue tools and
limited  use  of  digital  ones,  especially  budgeting
apps. Most of such work has also limitedly engaged
the mental accounting theory (Thaler, 1999) despite
initial acknowledgments of the value of behavioural
economics in HCI.

3.  METHOD

To identify the budgeting apps, we searched the two
marketplaces  in  the  UK:  Google  Play  Store  (for
Android)  and  Apple  Store  (for  iOS)  using  three
keywords: budget, budgeting and finance. From the
total of 1335 apps as shown in Figure 1, we removed
duplicates, apps that were not free, apps not related
to budgeting, those requiring access to one’s bank
accounts  and  retained  top-rated  apps  with  an
average rating score of four out of five and with at
least  1000  reviews.  This  led  to  45  apps  being
included  in  the  analysis  (Table  1,  col  1):    21  apps
available  only  on  Google  Play  Store  and  24  apps
available  on  both  platforms.  The  functionalities  of
these  45  apps  were  iteratively  reviewed  to  identify
functionalities, firstly through analysing all the apps’

using a different budget for each expense category
such as bills, rent, groceries (26 apps- Table 2, col
11,  albeit  4  of  these  provide  budgeting  only  as
premium, subscription-based functionality). Most of
the apps show limited theoretical underpinning, with
only two apps Goodbudget (Partners, no date) and
SimpleBudget (Tanu, 2011) explicitly mentioning in
their  description  that  their  design  was  informed  by
money  envelope  systems, albeit  specific  reference
to  mental  accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999)  is  not
made.  Also,  no  app’s  description  reports
its
evaluation though users' studies.

4.1  Accounts: Types and Terminology

A  significant  finding  is  the  concept  of  accounts
partially employed by our explored apps in order to
support  the  organization  of  transactions.  Mental
accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999)  identifies  three
types of accounts, namely those for depositing and

storing available funds such as monthly income (i.e.
money-in), those for depositing and storing assets or
wealth such as saving accounts and those for using
or  spending  the  available  funds  (i.e.  money-out)  .
With  regard  to  the  latter,  the  theory  also  specifies
that  people  create  mental  accounts  for  allocating
money  for  specific  purposes  or  in  other  words  for
budgeting  for  specific  categories  of  expenses,
similar to money envelopes which will be discussed
later. With regard to these three types of accounts
proposed  by  mental  accounting  theory,  findings
indicate  that  most  of  the  apps  support  depositing
funds (44 apps) and paying for expenses (45 apps),
with fewer apps support saving (11 apps- Table 2,
col 3).

However, while most of the apps (41 apps- Table 2,
col  2)  have  accounts  for  depositing  funds  or  for
paying  for  expenses  ,  the  remaining  four  apps
(DAILY  POCKET  (Yjteam,  2017),  EasyBudget
(Letondor,  2015),  Expense  Tracker
-  Money
Manager & Budget (Labs, 2019) and Budget App -

Evaluating Budgeting Apps: Limited Support for Budgeting Compared to Tracking
Alenazi • Sas

Expense  Tracker  (HG  Group  Inc.,  2020))  merely
support the depositing of money on the app’s home
screen  rather  than  in  dedicated  income  account.
This  is  problematic  as  these  four  apps  also  fail  to
provide  the  option  of linking individual transactions
to  specific  accounts,  as  they  are  all  stored  directly
on  the  home  screen.  Even  for  the  remaining  apps
providing  the  option  of  creating  income,  saving  or
expense  accounts,
income  and  expense,
although  conceptually  distinct,  they  support  the
depositing and spending of the funds from the same
container, respectively.  In other words, for most of
the  apps,  the  income  and  expense  accounts,
although conceptually distinct, in practice they tend
to be  one and the same account similar  to a bank
account or a wallet where money are both deposited
in and spent from.

the

for

Findings also indicate various terms for referring to
such accounts, inconsistently used across the apps.
The employed terminology appears to draw from two
different  sources:  banking  domain  and  everyday
financial  practices.  A  significant  outcome  is  that
most  of  the  apps  employed  terms  from  banking
domain  for  naming  or  labelling  accounts.  Such
terms,  used
income,  saving  or  expense
accounts, include: virtual bank accounts (nine apps),
virtual cash accounts (17 apps), saving accounts (11
apps),  investment  accounts  (seven  apps),  virtual
credit card  account (17  apps), virtual debt  account
(13  apps),  with  many  apps  (18  apps)  employing
more than one of these terms for organizing funds,
wealth  and  expenses.  While  such  terminology  for
banking domain can be useful as it builds on users’
familiarity  with  banking  practices,
the  direct
association  with  banking  practices  is  limited  since
only  seven  apps  support  the  integration  of  the
budgeting apps with users’ online banking services
and only as premium feature (Table 2, col 9). This
terminology  from  banking  domain  also  fails  to
provide specific types of expense accounts such as
those  for  different  categories  of  expenses  or  the
equivalent of money envelopes (Thaler, 1999), since
banking  accounts  capturing  spending
relate
exclusively to debt repayment such as credit or debit
card  or  mortgage,  but  not  for  instance  to  monthly
grocery, bills or rent budgets.

Other  terms  to  label  accounts  are  borrowed  from
everyday  financial  practices  and  include  wallet
(three  apps:  Expense  Tracker  &  Budget  App
(Estimate, 2019), Easy Home Finance (VoPo, 2015)
and Spendee Budget & Money Tracker (A.s., 2013)),
financial account (one app: Family budget-spending
tracker  (DigitLeaf,  2017)),  payment  account  (one
app – Money pro (LLC, 2017)) or even budget (two
apps:  Fudget:  Budget  and  expense  tracking  app
(Connell, 2017) and Home Budget - Money Manager
(Softs, no date)). Interestingly, with respect to terms
from everyday practices, findings indicate that clear
ones  for  distinguishing  among  available  funds,
wealth and expense accounts or between money-in

4

and money-out are not employed by any of the apps
except  one  app:  GnuCash  which  uses  multiple
accounts such as income, expenses and assets.

4.2  Creating and Tracking Transactions:

Income, Expenses, Transfer

Study findings also highlight the important distinction
between  accounts  and  transactions.  We  suggest
that  accounts  are  similar  to  containers  for  the
organization of transactions, while each transaction
represents the movement of money from a source to
a  destination,  in  other  words,  transactions  are  the
ones  that  allow  accounts  to  be  replenished  with
funds or depleted  of funds. Findings indicate three
types  of  transactions  for  (i)  depositing  funds,  (ii)
paying for expenses or (iii) transferring money from
income  to  expense  accounts  which  are  further
from  one  app
detailed.  All  apps  apart
(SimpleBudget:  Envelope  Budget)  allow  users  to
deposit  funds,  through  income  transactions  (44
apps- Table 1, col 2) by specifying the name or label
of the transactions, usually referring to the source of
money  such  as  salary,  together  with  the  specific
amount of money being deposited, the date (all but
two apps- Table 1, col 5) and time (18 apps- Table
1, col 6) of the income transaction and its currency
(40 apps – Table 1, col 4).

From the 40 apps supporting the specification of the
currency of deposited funds, 12 apps provide a pre-
defined  list  of  currencies  allowing  users  to  choose
different  one  for  each  income  transaction  being
created, while 28 apps provide a pre-defined list of
currencies  albeit  in  the  app  settings  so  each
transaction  with  a  different  currency  requires
changing  it  in  the  app  setting.  These  two  options
prioritize either the ease of changing currency or of
keeping  it  constant  across  transactions.  Unlike  the
rest of the apps, SimpleBudget app does not support
the  creation  of  an  income  account;  instead,  it
supports  users  to  create  multiple  envelopes,  each
with  its  own  budget  or  available  fund,  without
specifying the total amount of available funds to be
allocated  across  all  the  envelopes.  This  can  be
problematic in terms of the cognitive load needed to
ensure that the available funds not captured by the
app,  do  not  exceed  the  cumulative  value  of  the
money envelopes.

With  respect  to  expense  transactions,  all  apps
support  users  to  create  them  (Table  1,  col  7),  by
specifying the names or labels of these transactions,
usually  the  destination  of  money  such  as  grocery
expense,  together  with  the  specific  amount  of
money  being  paid  (45  apps),  the  date  (45  apps-
Table 1, col 10) and time (18 apps- Table 1, col 11)
of the expense transaction and its currency (41 apps
–  Table  1,  col  9)  with  similar  ease  of  changing
currency  or  of  keeping  constant  characterizing
income transactions.

With
the
transactions, most apps support the creation of both
income and expense transactions through the same
interaction  by  tapping  on  the  plus  icon  on  app’s
home screen (35 apps), by clicking on income button
or expense button on the app’s home screen (eight
apps)  or  by  tapping  on  “register”  button  on  app’s
home  screen  which  opens  another  page  to  create
the  income  or  expense  (one  app  –  MoneyWise
(North,  2011).  One  remaining  app  (CoinKeeper:
expense, money manager, budget planner) provides
different  interactions  for  entering  income,  i.e.,  by
tapping on the plus icon on app’s home screen and
for entering expense, i.e., by dragging a transaction
account icon into expense category then specify the
expense  amount
the  dragged  account.
Arguably,  the  simple  interaction  for  tapping  on  the
plus icon on app’s home screen to enter both income
and  expense  transaction  is  preferrable  in  terms  of
increased usability.

from

In  addition  to  income  and  expense  transactions,
findings also indicate the third type, namely transfer
transactions  (35  apps-  Table  2,  col  5),  which  we
define as transfer of money from a source (available
income) to a destination (for expense or saving). In
addition
to  specifying  source  and  destination
accounts (35 apps), transfer transactions could also
specify the amount of money being transferred (35
apps), transfer date (30 apps- Table 2, col 6), time
(11 apps- Table 2, col 7), currency (25 apps) as well
as  label  or  receipt  which  can  be  attached  to  the
transfer (five apps and three apps premium- Table
2, col 8).  Interestingly, most of the apps supporting
transfer  transactions  allow  them  without  sufficient
funds in the source account (33 apps out of 35). Two
exceptions  include  the  Family  budget-spending
tracker app, where if the transferred amount is larger
than the available funds, the message of “insufficient
amount”  is  shown  in  red  colour  and  the  transfer
cannot  be  completed.  For
the  other  app
(MoneyWise), the transfer transaction is a premium
feature.

An important finding is that similar transactions can
also be grouped in categories, for both income and
expenses transactions. This functionality aligns with
the cognitive operations of grouping different income
and expenditures into categories mentioned by the
mental  accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999).  These
categories  could  be  of  two  types:  provided  by  the
app or defined by the user. The former consists of a
list of categories for income such as salary, bonus,
gift, refund, business and interest (38/45 apps) and
for  expense
(40/45  apps)  such  as  grocery,
shopping,  transportation,  bills,  education  and  rent.
The user defined categories allow users to specify
new  ones  if  those  provided  by  the  app  are  not

5

re-used

adequate, both for income (36/45 apps and two apps
premium) and for expense transactions (42/45 apps
and  one  app  premium)  and  once  crated,  these
categories  could  be
later  with  new
transactions.  However,  some  apps  provide  the
limited option of one-off categories for income (four
apps) and expense (two apps). Therefore, with each
new transaction, the user needs to enter the source
of income and the expense name. While most apps
provided one level of categories, 15 apps provided
option
transactions.  For
example,  car  expense  category  can  have  sub-
categories such as fines, fuel, parking and repairs.

for  subcategories  of

Finally, all transactions can be entered manually (45
apps), they can also be automatically imported from
online banking accounts linked to the budgeting app
(seven  apps),  with  few  apps  encouraging  users  to
compare  their  entered  transactions  with  those  of
their bank statements (seven apps).

4.3  Budgeting: Tracking Balance vs Money

Envelopes

Findings  indicate  that  all  apps  support  budgeting
functionality  and
the  monitoring  of
therefore
expenses against the allocated budgets (45 apps),
although they do so in different ways. While most of
these  apps  support  budgeting  under  mental
accounts or money envelopes (26 apps), others do
not (19 apps). We called the latter form of budgeting
as single budget and the former as multiple budgets,
as further detailed.

Apps supporting single budget (19 apps) rely on only
one main budget (usually the same amount as the
available funds) from which all expenses are to be
covered.  In  these  apps,  expense  transactions  are
not  grouped  under  specific  money  envelops  with
allocated  budgets  for  each  envelope,  which  would
be consistent with mental accounting theory (Thaler,
1999).  Although  these  apps  have  a  single  budget,
they do support a high-level monitoring of expenses
and  do  so  in  two  ways.  While  all  19  apps  use  the
account  balance  to  represent  the  overspent  of
available funds using the minus symbol, eight apps
do not change the colour  of this information, albeit
seven  apps  use  colour  red
this
information of overspent.

to  provide

Although  single  budget  apps  depend  on  the  total
funds, some of these apps allow to set that fund as
explicit budget for all expense (five out of 19 apps).
These five apps do not have a specific budget name
by the user, it was named by the app as budget and
the  user  can  set  the  budget  amount  and  budget
period (Table 2, col 13) as daily (one app - Spending
Tracker),  weekly  (two  apps  -  DAILY  POCKET  -
Budget  Manager  and  Spending  Tracker),  monthly
(four apps), yearly (one app - Spending Tracker) or
defined by the user (one app - Monny).

the

Four of these 19 apps support also multiple budgets
but  only  as  a  premium  functionality.  In  contrast  to
single  budgets,  26  apps  support  the  creation  of
multiple  budgets  which  aligns  with  mental
accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999).  These  apps
functionality  of  creating  money
support
envelopes  by  allowing  users  to  allocate  different
budgets to distinct expense categories, for instance
for  groceries,  transport  or  bills.  Furthermore,  15  of
the  26  apps  provide  the  option  to  personalize  the
name  of  the  budget,  i.e.,  budget  for  bills  category
can  be  called  for  instance  household  bill  budget,
while  the  remaining  11  apps  use  the  name  of  the
expense  category  as  the  name  the  budget,  i.e.,
budget for bills category is bills budget.

(seven  apps),  monthly

In addition, the budget period could be also set for
all these 26 apps from predefined  periods such as
daily  (provided  by  seven  apps),  weekly  (15  apps),
fortnight
(26  apps),
biannually (three apps) and annually (14 apps), with
17  apps  providing  multiple  predefined  budgeting
periods. The budgeting periods can also be defined
by  users  with  six  apps  providing  the  option  of
entering a specific date.

We reviewed the functionalities of  the 45 top-rated
budgeting  apps  to  explore  if  and  how  these
functionalities  are  grounded
the  mental
accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999).  Our  findings
indicate  limited  clarity  regarding  the  two  important
terms  of  accounts  and  transactions  and  limited
support for budgeting functionality. We suggest four
design  implications  including  the  recommendation
for developers to use clearer terminology  to define
and differentiate accounts and transactions and their
specific  types,  for  better  supporting  budgeting
through  money  envelopes,  and
for  grounding
budgeting  as  mental  activity  in  the  actual  financial
practices.

suggest  the  use  of  consistent  terminology  for
accounts that clearly defines accounts as containers
of transactions distinguishing accounts for available
funds, wealth and expenses (Thaler, 1999).

5.2  Defining Transactions and their Types:

Income, Expenses, Transfer

Related  to  the  three  types  of  accounts,  findings
indicate  transactions  reflecting  the  flow  of  money
and their three types for depositing funds, paying for
expenses  or  transferring  money  from  income  to
expense  accounts,  which  however  are  not
supported  by  all  apps.  We  suggest  defining
transactions and providing options to create each of
them, with the following details of transaction name,
category,  amount,  currency,  date,  time,  supported
by  most  but  not  all  apps.  Based  on  the  mental
accounting  theory  (Thaler,  1999),  the  funds  and
expenses should be labelled as such and grouped
into  categories  according
financial
practices. Study findings show limited functionalities
supporting  the  allocation  of  income  and  expenses
into  specific  categories.  This  is  problematic  as
spending  money  from  a  general  pot  rather  than
specific  pots  for  different  expense  categories,  can
more  easily  lead  to  over  expenditure.  To  address
income  and  expense
this
transactions should be grouped into categories and
subcategories,  such  as
income  and  salary,
respectively. These could be both predefined by the
system or defined by the user.

For currency, findings indicate two exclusive ways of
selecting
transaction  or  across
transactions  through  app  settings.  We  suggest  a
flexible approach allowing users to choose between
these  two  modes  of  selecting  the  currency.  For
entering  transactions,  the  simplest  interaction  that
we  suggest  is  tapping  on  the  plus  icon  on  app’s
home screen, while for transfer transactions, those
with
funds  should  be
consistently prevented.

5.1  Defining Accounts and their Types:

Available Fund, Wealth, Expenses

5.3  Supporting Budgeting through Money

Envelopes

Findings show that not all top-rated budgeting apps
provide the option of creating each of the three types
of accounts advocated by mental accounting theory
funds,  wealth  and
(Thaler,  1999):  available
expenses and those which do use diverse terms for
these  accounts,  informed  mostly  by  banking  or
everyday financial practices. The lack of support for
differentiating among these distinct types of account
is problematic.

To  address  this,  we  suggest  the  importance  of
making clear the distinction between what accounts
for storage of income, i.e. money-in, for expenses,
i.e.  money-out  and  for  saving  as  supported  by
mental  account  theory  (Thaler,  1999).  We  also

While  all  budgeting  apps  support  the  tracking
expenses, a few do not support budgeting and from
those  that  do,  only  26  apps  do  that  following  the
mental  accounts  or  money  envelopes  for  specific
expense  categories  as  advocated  by  mental
accounting theory (Thaler, 1999) rather than through
merely single budgets. This is an important finding
indicating limitations of these apps and the value of
employing  more  consistently  multiple  budgets  for
each  of  the  expense  categories.  We  also  suggest
the  use  of  money  envelopes  for  the  budgets
to

differentiate  them  from  expense  categories  which
merely track expense transactions of a specific type.
Multiple  budgets  or  money  envelopes  are  defined

through  the  amount  being  budgeted,  budget  name
and  budget  period  using  both  system-  and  user-
defined  periods,  although  not  all  apps  provide
support  for  each  of  these  details. We  suggest  that
budgeting apps  support such a complete definition
of  budgets  and  their  allocation  to  specific  expense
categories. Although the use of envelopes and jars
has been noticed in previous HCI work on financial
practices  (Snow and Vyas, 2015a; Vyas et al., 2015,
2016), this was mostly as a way to store money for
specific  purposes,
for  digital
rather
materialization  of  mental  accounts.  Therefore,  we
strongly  call  for  better  design  for  budgeting  app
articulating  the  concept  of  mental  accounting  and
support the use of money envelopes with allocated
budget  to  help  users  organize,  track  and  more
importantly keep their spending under control.

5.4  Grounding Budgeting as Cognitive Process

in Actual Financial Behaviour

the

than

Budgeting  apps  support  the  tracking  of  expenses
and  monitoring  them  against  available  funds  or
allocated budget. Such functions however prioritize
cognitive  operations  rather
financial
behaviours themselves. This is reflected in the small
number  of  budgeting  apps
integrating  online
banking to support for instance automatic import of
the real transactions. This indicates limited support
for  encouraging  users  to  compare  their  entered
transactions  with  those  in  bank  statements.  Such
grounding in actual financial behaviours is crucial for
infusing practical value and realism to the otherwise
cognitive exercise of budgeting. We suggest the use
of clear terminology differentiating banking accounts
and
the
budgeting app.

6.  CONCLUSION

We  report  on  functionality  review  of  45  top-rated
budgeting apps. Findings suggest the value of more
nuanced vocabulary for describing the key concepts
of accounts, transactions and budgets as informed
by  mental  accounting  theory  and  for  differentiating
between  tracking  the  transactions  and  monitoring
the  allocated  budgets  through  money  envelopes.
We  conclude  with  four  design  implications  for
financial  technologies  such  as  budgeting  apps
including  clear  definitions  of  accounts  and
transaction  and  their  different  types,  supporting
for
budgeting
through  money  envelopes  and
in
grounding  budgeting  as  cognitive  process

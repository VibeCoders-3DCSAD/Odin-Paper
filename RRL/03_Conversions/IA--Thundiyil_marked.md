Abstract
Analysis of time series data for classification or prediction tasks is very useful in various applications
such as healthcare, climate studies and finance. As big data resources have recently become available
in many fields, it is now possible to apply extremely high dimensional deep learning models that can
model long-term temporal and spatial context. Traditional methods such as autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), gated recurrent units
(GRUs) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have provided robust frameworks in the analysis of time
series data. However, these methods have had limited success when applied to applications where long-
term context is crucial. Transformer-based architectures such as ChatGPT have emerged as a powerful
method for this class of problems. In this review, we provide a detailed analysis of state of the art in
deep learning systems that model long-term context. We review eleven transformer-based architectures
that have been successfully applied to healthcare-related applications involving time series or high
resolution image data. We have focused on enhanced transformer architectures that can solve important
challenges such as segmentation, forecasting, and classification.
1. Introduction
Time series data analysis involves the examination of datasets composed of time-ordered entries. This
analysis is crucial in many fields for predicting future trends, understanding past behaviors, and making
informed decisions. Time series data analysis is a fundamental aspect of statistical studies and data
science, playing a critical role in numerous fields ranging from healthcare and finance to climate science
and engineering. The core idea of time series analysis is to understand, model, and predict temporal
data. The values in time series data are recorded at successive points in time, often at equally spaced
intervals and hence the data is inherently sequential.
Time series data possesses several distinct characteristics that are critical for its analysis and interpre-
tation. Some of the important characteristics of time series analysis are autocorrelation, trend and sea-
sonality [1], [2], [3]. Autocorrelation in time series data refers to the degree of correlation between a
time series and a lagged version of itself. It shows how much similar or related the data points are to
their past values within the series:
𝐸[(𝑥(𝑡) − 𝜇)(𝑥(𝑡 + 𝜏) − 𝜇)]
𝑅(𝜏) = . (1)
𝜎!
In Eq. 1 we show the autocorrelation 𝑅(𝜏) of a time series 𝑥(𝑡) at lag 𝜏, where 𝐸 is the expected value,
𝜇 is the mean of the time series, and 𝜎! is the variance of the time series.
Trend refers to the long-term movement or direction in the data over time, disregarding short-term
fluctuations. It represents the underlying tendency of the data to increase, decrease, or remain stable
over a long period. Trends can be linear or nonlinear and can vary in slope and shape depending on the
nature of the data and the factors influencing it.
Seasonality captures the regular fluctuations or patterns that occur at specific regular intervals, such as
daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. This is especially common in data related to weather, retail sales, and

energy consumption, where the time of year significantly influences the data. Sometimes such seasonal
variations can be at irregular intervals. These irregular intervals are referred as cyclical variations rather
than seasonality.
Stationarity is another characteristic of time series data where statistical properties such as mean, vari-
ance, and autocorrelation are constant over time. Many time series models assume that the data is sta-
tionary, or they involve transforming the data to achieve stationarity. The random variation in the data
that cannot be attributed to trend, seasonality, or cycles may be considered as noise. Noise is inherently
stochastic and unpredictable, often referred to as the “error” or “residual” part of a time series.
Careful analysis of time series data is crucial in many diverse domains since it enables predictive ana-
lytics and gives us insights into important temporal patterns. In the financial sector, time series data
such as stock prices, exchange rates, and economic indicators like GDP and inflation rates are essential
for market analysis and forecasting [4]. Financial time series are characterized by their volatility and
are often analyzed for trend detection, anomaly identification, and risk assessment [5],[6]. Similarly,
environmental, and climatological time series, including temperature recordings, rainfall measure-
ments, and air quality indices, play a vital role in climate modeling and environmental research. These
datasets are integral for understanding long-term climate patterns, seasonal variations, and environmen-
tal change assessments [7].
Biomedical time series data, including heart rate monitoring and EEG recordings, are fundamental in
patient health monitoring and medical research [8]. In speech signal processing, time series analysis has
been applied to enhance voice recognition systems and improve human-computer interaction. Algo-
rithms for speech signal analysis have been developed to extract features in both time and frequency
domains, providing valuable insights for speech recognition and processing [9]. In industrial settings,
time series data such as production levels and equipment performance metrics aid in optimizing opera-
tions and predictive maintenance. Retail and business analytics heavily rely on time series data for sales
forecasting and understanding consumer behavior patterns.
Large language model (LLM) based algorithms are used for generating auxiliary virtual images, demon-
strating significant improvements in image processing tasks. The use of a transformer architecture to
enrich feature diversity of images, showcases the potential of LLMs in image processing applications
[10]. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs in image processing highlights the significance of spatial
and temporal contexts. Spatial context often requires detailed analysis within a snapshot, while temporal
context benefits from long-term models that track changes over time.
Each of these time series data categories, with their unique properties and patterns, require specialized
analytical techniques. From stochastic models and machine learning algorithms to signal processing
and statistical methods, the insights derived from these analyses are pivotal in decision-making pro-
cesses across various sectors. For example, in Figure 1, we show the stock market variation in Dow
Jones from Jan 2023 to Feb 2024. Trend is very important in such signals, and such signals are not zero
mean or easily modeled by stable linear systems.
In Figure 2, we show a satellite image of glacier shrinkage due to climatic conditions. It is to be noted
the time series data need not always be one dimensional as in stock market or biomedical signals. The
idea of spatial context, the ability to model the relationship between adjacent pixels, is important in
applications, such as image and video processing, environmental modeling, and geographical infor-
mation systems. In such applications, the data encapsulates not only the change over time but also the
intricate spatial interconnections between data points. For instance, in satellite imagery analysis used
for environmental monitoring or urban planning, each pixel's value evolves over time, reflecting
changes due to natural events, human activities, or seasonal cycles.
In Figure 3, we provide another example of time series data obtained from the EEG recordings. Such
signals, which are multichannel in nature, have both temporal and spatial dependencies. Here, spatial
dependencies mean correlations between channels, where each channel corresponds to a signal

collected from a sensor placed in a specific location on the scalp. A temporal event, such as a seizure,
occurs on multiple channels which are physically close to one another.
2. Traditional Time Series Analysis Techniques
Traditional methods for time series analysis have evolved over the years. To analyze time series data,
classical approaches such as autoregressive models were widely used, especially for prediction tasks.
These models predict future data points using a linear combination of past values. The autoregressive
model assumes that the output variable depends linearly on its previous values and a stochastic term.
Talwar [11] explored various autoregressive models for dynamic forecasting of equity markets, empha-
sizing the use of past data in predicting future volatility. Bondon [12] provided an explicit formula for
the prediction error of future values of a stationary process with incomplete past data, highlighting the
use of autoregressive processes. Madadi et al. [13] expanded autoregressive models to forecast dynamic
line ratings in power networks, addressing the trend and fluctuation of past data. Ray [14] discussed the
use of mid-prediction filters in autoregressive models for separating the nonstationary part of a signal.
Hall et al. [15] explored high-dimensional generalized linear autoregressive models, offering insights
into predicting future observations using current and past observations. Engle [16] introduced auto-
regressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes, a class of stochastic processes used for fore-
casting with nonconstant variances conditional on the past. Rather [17] presented an autoregressive
neural network approach for predicting stock returns, emphasizing the use of past values in regression
variables.
2.1. Correlation-Based Methods
Moving average (MA) models use the past forecast errors in a regression-like model. A moving average
model helps in smoothing out noise from random fluctuations in time series data. Autoregressive mov-
ing average (ARMA) models combine both AR and MA models to describe time series data using both
autoregressive terms and moving average terms. Loneck & Zurbenko [18] discussed the Kolmogorov-
Zurbenko periodogram with DiRienzo-Zurbenko smoothing for spectral analysis of time series data,
comparing its performance to traditional ARIMA algorithms. Sun et al. [19] proposed an MA method
based on complex exponential decomposition for noise elimination in non-stationary and non-linear
signals.
An extension of ARMA, autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) includes differ-
encing of raw observations (integration) to make the time series stationary, which is a common require-
ment for AR and MA models. Lee et al. [20] applied an ARIMA model to predict future network
throughput, crucial for improving network protocols. Garg et al. [21] used the ARIMA model to analyze
long-term noise monitoring data in traffic noise pollution studies. Valipour et al. [22] estimated the
ability of ARIMA models in forecasting the monthly inflow of Dez dam reservoir. Sameh & El-
shabrawy [23] investigated the application of ARIMA and SARIMAX models in the context of climate
change time series forecasting. Pitfield [24] compared the efficiency of ARIMA and regression models
in simulating air-transport passengers by route.
The Box-Jenkins methodology [1],[35] is a systematic method for applying an autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) model. Haviluddin & Alfred [36] presented an approach for network traffic
characterization using the ARIMA technique, demonstrating its application in modeling internet net-
work traffic. Jafarian-Namin et al. [37] focused on modeling and forecasting the yearly inflation rate of
Iran using ARIMA, employing the Box-Jenkins methodology to confirm the effectiveness of different
ARIMA models. Duarte et al. [38] compared Box and Jenkins methodologies with Artificial Neural
Networks in time series forecasting, highlighting the performance of ARIMA and Transfer Function
Models versus Neural Network Models. Jamii et al. [39] aimed to predict carbon dioxide emissions in
Morocco using the Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach, demonstrating the application of this methodology
in environmental modeling.

Seasonal decomposition techniques decompose a time series into seasonal, trend, and residual compo-
nents, typically using moving averages. Dozie & Ibebuogu [25] discussed the decomposition with the
mixed model using the Buys-Ballot method, emphasizing the estimation of trend parameters, seasonal
indices, and residual components. Hebbel & Heiler [26] presented a method for decomposing a time
series into trend-cyclical and seasonal components, using a smoothness criterion and goodness of fit
criterion. He et al. [27] developed a seasonal-trend decomposition-based dendritic neuron model
(STLDNM) for financial time series prediction, highlighting the effectiveness of seasonal-trend decom-
position in complex data series. Sulandari et al. [28] combined deterministic function and neural net-
work models to forecast time series with trend and seasonal patterns, utilizing singular spectrum anal-
ysis (SSA) for decomposition. Lacroix [29] explored short-term analysis and business cycle estimation
using seasonal decomposition, focusing on the consistency of methodologies in seasonal adjustment
and trend-cycle estimation. Zhang & Li [30] proposed a novel decomposition and combination tech-
nique for forecasting electricity consumption, using STL decomposition to separate trend, season, and
residual components of time series.
Cross-correlation and autocorrelation analysis measure the relationship between the time series and
lagged versions of itself or another time series. Dean & Dunsmuir [51] highlight the dangers of cross-
correlation in time series analysis within various fields, emphasizing the importance of constructing
transfer function autoregressive models to avoid spurious relationships due to autocorrelation. Olden &
Neff [52] discuss the biases in cross-correlation analysis caused by intra-multiplicity (the time lags
observed and the cross-correlation coefficients that are computed within a pair of time series) even in
the absence of autocorrelation, and provide formulas to quantify and minimize these biases. Taylor [53]
explains how autocorrelations, correlograms, and plots of the autocorrelation function can reveal the
structure of a cycle within time-series data, providing statistical methods for deeper analysis. Zhang,
Huang, Shekhar, & Kumar [54] utilize spatial autocorrelation to propose new processing strategies for
correlation-based similarity range queries and joins, offering a novel approach to managing the compu-
tational cost of correlation analysis in spatial time series datasets. Stattegger [55] employs time series
analysis techniques like autocorrelation and cross-correlation to reconstruct tectonic structures from
geochemical drill hole log data, demonstrating the application of these methods in geology.
2.2. Frequency Domain and Multi-Timescale Based Methods
Fourier analysis techniques transform a time series into its frequency components. This is particularly
useful in signal processing and in situations where periodic patterns need to be identified. Kaiser [31]
discussed windowed Fourier transforms, highlighting their utility in providing information about sig-
nals simultaneously in the time and frequency domains, which is essential in signal processing. Brad-
ford [32] examined time-frequency analysis methods, including Fourier Transforms, for analyzing sys-
tems with changing dynamic properties, underlining their importance in civil engineering and
seismology. Kolawole [33] covered frequency analysis of signals using Fourier series and Fourier trans-
form, emphasizing its role in signal processing and systems design. Vergura et al. [34] conducted a
time-frequency analysis using Fourier and Wavelet transforms to detect properties of power required
by different types of users, showcasing the application of Fourier analysis in power systems.
Spectral analysis uses the frequency spectrum contained in time series data, which is particularly useful
in fields like seismology and electrophysiology. Ghaderpour et al. [56] introduced the antileakage least-
squares spectral analysis for seismic data regularization and random noise attenuation, offering solu-
tions to the spectral leakage problem. Baisch & Bokelmann [57] presented a method for spectral anal-
ysis of non-equidistantly spaced time series, applying the CLEAN algorithm to seismological data to
detect temporal changes in elastic wave velocities. Ghil et al. [7] reviewed advanced spectral methods
for climatic time series, illustrating connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics,
and discussing signal-to-noise enhancement.
Wavelet analysis breaks down time series data into different frequency components and studying each
component with a resolution matched to its scale. Karim et al. [64] explored the use of wavelets (symlet
16) to detect business cycles in Malaysia by decomposing time series to study long-run trends and high-

5
frequency components. Bartosch & Wassermann [65] presented a wavelet coherence method to display
local coherence information between two seismic stations, applying it to seismic near-field data from
Stromboli volcano. Masuda & Okabe [66] discussed the application of the wavelet transform for sta-
tionarity analysis and predictions in time series, allowing the observation of series in both time and
frequency domains simultaneously. Schiff [67] adapted a noise reduction technique for time-series data
using wavelets, presenting a method that filters noise using control surrogate data sets. Torrence &
Compo [68] provided a practical guide to wavelet analysis with examples from the El Niño–Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), including statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra.
Exponential smoothing techniques include methods like Simple Exponential Smoothing for univariate
data without trend or seasonality, and Holt-Winters’ Exponential Smoothing for data with trend and/or
seasonality. Gelper et al. [40] presented robust versions of exponential and Holt-Winters smoothing
methods suitable for forecasting univariate time series in the presence of outliers, offering a recursive
updating scheme for pre-cleaned data. Taylor & McSharry [41] evaluated univariate forecasting meth-
ods using European electricity demand data, highlighting the performance of double seasonal Holt-
Winters exponential smoothing among other methods for predicting up to a day-ahead demand.
Luoman [42] introduced three kinds of exponential smoothing — Simple, Holt and Winters. These are
applicable to time series data with a variety of characteristics including trend and seasonality.
2.3. Nonlinear Methods
There were methods developed to deal with time series data exhibiting nonlinear behaviors, which can-
not be captured adequately by linear models. Hegger et al. [58] describe the TISEAN package, which
implements methods of nonlinear time series analysis based on deterministic chaos, covering data rep-
resentation, prediction, noise reduction, dimension and Lyapunov estimation, and nonlinearity testing.
Small [59] focuses on time series embedding and reconstruction, essential for analyzing experimental
time series data with nonlinear methods, including discussions on determinism and stationarity in phys-
iological data. Bradley & Kantz [60] revisit nonlinear time-series analysis, discussing the practical is-
sues that restrict the approach's power, such as signal sampling and noise, and highlighting its successful
application across thousands of real and synthetic data sets.

need for extensions of methods towards systems coupled to random noises and those with more than a
few active degrees of freedom. Zou et al. [62] provide an in-depth review of complex network methods

works, visibility graphs, and Markov chain-based transition networks. Pereda et al. [63] describe non-
linear multivariate analysis methods used in neurophysiology to study the relationship between simul-
taneously recorded signals, covering concepts of phase synchronization, generalized synchronization,
and event synchronization.
2.4. Regression-Based Methods
Identifying and analyzing trends in time series data often requires statistical techniques to model and
forecast future values based on observed trends. Neves & Cordeiro [43] presented an approach integrat-
ing exponential smoothing and bootstrap methodologies for time series prediction, emphasizing the
importance of selecting the best model for accurate forecasts. Zavala & Messina [44] provided a statis-

sized the role of stationarity in business and economic research, discussing the importance of identifying
non-stationary time series and the need for stationarity in the data prior to analysis. Hu [50] introduced
the combination of time series forecasting with topological data analysis as a technique to solve real-
world problems, using COVID-19 pandemic data as a case study.
In this section we have discussed the traditional time series analysis methods ranging from auto-regres-
sive models, which leverage past values for predictions, and moving average models, aimed at smooth-
ing out noise, to more complex Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). These techniques
have been applied across various domains, such as finance, climate studies, biomedical, speech signal
etc. Techniques such as seasonal decomposition and Fourier analysis are used to identify the periodic
patterns whereas exponential smoothing and trend analysis provide tools for handling data with or with-
out seasonal variations. Spectral, wavelet, and nonlinear time series analyses offer advanced methods
for dealing with complex data structures. The variety of methodologies discussed in this section high-
lights the evolution of time series analysis in capturing and forecasting the intricate behaviors of se-
quential data across various fields.
3. Modern Approaches in Time Series Analysis
Modern methods for time series analysis have significantly evolved, incorporating advanced statistical
techniques, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence. These methods are capable of han-
dling large volumes of data, complex patterns, and non-linear relationships, making them suitable for a
wide range of applications, from finance and business forecasting to environmental monitoring and
healthcare. In this section, we highlight several approaches that represented fundamental advances in
the field, or introduced paradigms that became the foundation for more advanced approaches.
3.1. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning optimizes a cumulative reward metric to make decisions over time. Ansari

forcement learning, observing both past and future trends of stock prices to make optimal trading deci-
sions. This study demonstrated the effective use of reinforcement learning in algorithmic trading and
stock market forecasting. Aboussalah et al. [70] explored the value of the cross-sectional approach to

egies, demonstrating its ability to reproduce trading decisions and improve convergence in dynamic
environments.

3.2. Nonparametric Methods
Techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and similar clus-
tering algorithms are widely used for time series clustering and classification tasks. These methods are
robust and powerful, and often are used to establish baseline performance for new data sets and appli-
cations. Chandralekha & Shenbagavadivu [75] explored clustering and classification in machine learn-
ing, particularly for predicting heart disease by analyzing various medical diagnostic parameters and
patterns. They compared unsupervised learning (like K-means, K-modes, K-medoids) and supervised
learning (such as SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and k-NN). Senthil & Suseendran [76] proposed
a Sliding Window Technique-based Improved Association Rule Mining with Enhanced SVM (SWT-
IARM with ESVM) for time series data classification. This approach focuses on efficient rule discovery
and classification by combining ESVM classification with IARM for more accurate rule classification.
Ougiaroglou et al. [77] explored the application of data reduction techniques as a preprocessing step
before training Neural Networks and SVMs for time series classification. They also proposed a new
data reduction technique based on the k-median clustering algorithm. Yang et al. [78] developed a ker-
nel fuzzy c-means clustering-based fuzzy SVM algorithm (KFCM-FSVM) for dealing with classifica-
tion problems involving outliers or noises, using FCM clustering in the high-dimensional feature space.
Sathyamoorthy & Sivasankar [79] presented a hybrid approach where clustering algorithms are used to
reduce the training dataset size, followed by applying complex algorithms like SVM and MLP for clas-
sification on the reduced data set.
Advanced algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders are used to identify
unusual patterns or outliers in time series data, crucial in fraud detection and system health monitoring.
Aguilar et al. [80] proposed the first interpretable autoencoder based on decision trees, designed to
handle categorical data without the need to transform data representation. This model provides a natural
explanation for experts in application areas and is among the top-ranked anomaly detection algorithms,
along with One-class SVM and Gaussian Mixture. Park et al. [81] proposed multi-modal anomaly
detection in embedded systems using time-correlated measurements of power consumption and
memory accesses. They trained one-class SVM and isolation forest classifiers for anomaly detection,
showing accurate detection of anomalies.
Ma & Perkins [82] introduced a new algorithm for time-series novelty detection based on one-class
SVMs. They converted time-series into vectors in phase spaces and interpreted novel events as outliers
of the “normal” distribution, showing promising performance of the algorithm. Alfeo et al. [83] pro-
posed an anomaly detection approach based on deep learning for smart manufacturing. They combined
an autoencoder with a discriminator based on general heuristics, proving the convenience of this ap-
proach against isolation forest in industrial applications. Yang et al. [84] proposed a high-dimensional
anomaly detection algorithm based on isolated forest with a deep autoencoder (AE-IForest), mapping
high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space and fusing reconstruction error with data isolation
scores for anomaly detection.

time series analysis. They can capture spatial-temporal patterns in data, making them useful for series
with spatial components (like EEG signals). Liu et al. [100] proposed a multivariate convolutional

tecture using a combination of LSTM and convolutional layers to predict time-series energy data with
higher accuracy. Chen & Xu [89] developed a piecewise time series prediction model combining
stacked LSTM network with a genetic algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in automatically se-
lecting the proper structure according to the data.
Similar to LSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are a type of RNN that are efficient in modeling tem-
poral sequences and their long-range dependencies. They are used in situations where LSTMs might be
too computationally intensive. Onyekpe et al. [90] proposed a Quaternion Gated Recurrent Unit
(QGRU) for sensor fusion, leveraging quaternion algebra to map correlations within multidimensional
features more efficiently than traditional GRUs. Tallec & Ollivier (2018) proved that learnable gates in
recurrent models provide quasi-invariance to general time transformations in input data, leading to a
new way of initializing gate biases in LSTMs and GRUs. Shen et al. [91] explored the use of GRU

and accuracy in prediction. Huang [116] utilized Facebook Prophet with macroeconomic regressors for
forecasting stock prices, demonstrating its superiority in prediction accuracy compared to other models.
Mahmud [117] predicted and analyzed COVID-19 daily cases in Bangladesh using the Facebook
Prophet Model, demonstrating its capability in handling complex data series. Mphale et al. [118] pro-
posed the Facebook-Prophet model for forecasting COVID-19 mortality in the SADC region, highlight-
ing its effectiveness in prediction. Suresh et al. [119] conducted historical analysis and forecasting of
the stock market using the FB Prophet model, emphasizing its improved performance in forecasting.
Vector Autoregression (VAR) is an extension of the AR model that captures the linear interdependen-
cies among multiple time series. VAR models are widely used in econometrics. Lu [120] discusses the
application of VAR in analyzing the dynamics among geographic processes and for spatial autoregres-
sive modeling, providing an example of US population dynamics between 1910 and 1990. Myers et
al. [121] use VAR methods to analyze the contribution of supply, demand, and policy shocks to fluctu-
ations in the Australian wool market, comparing VAR procedures with conventional models. Alvarez-
De-Toledo et al. [122] offer an approximation between econometric techniques and system dynamics
methodology, showing how to simulate an SVAR model. McCracken et al. [123] assess forecasts from
a mixed-frequency VAR to obtain intra-quarter forecasts of output growth as new information becomes
available. Kilian & Lütkepohl [124] review the structural VAR approach in econometrics, contrasting
it with other methodologies and highlighting its application in macroeconomics and finance.
3.5. Hybrid Methods
Ensemble Methods combine predictions from multiple models to improve forecasting accuracy. Meth-
ods like random forests, gradient boosting, and bagging are used in an ensemble manner for time series
predictions. Galicia et al. [125]. This study presents ensemble models for forecasting big data time se-
ries, combining decision tree, gradient boosted trees, and random forest methods. The performance is
evaluated on electricity consumption data, showing that the ensemble models outperform individual
members. Valatsos et al. [126] predict critical time intervals for freight transportation using ensemble
learning techniques, including bagging, random forest, and gradient boosting.

10
Levy & O’Malley [130] combined traditional statistical models with modern machine learning tech-
niques to capture both linear and non-linear aspects of data. They introduced “Interaction Transformer”,
an algorithm that boosts logistic regression by integrating machine learning to identify interaction fea-
tures from a random forest model. Chen [131] reviews models for predicting business bankruptcies,
noting the shift from traditional statistical methodologies to machine learning techniques. The author
emphasizes the role of hybrid classifiers, combining machine learning algorithms like support vector
machines, decision trees, and genetic algorithms to improve the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction mod-
els. Anifowose et al. [132] present a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the formation cemen-
tation factor, combining the nonlinear feature selection capability of functional networks (FNs) with
traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). The FN-ANN hybrid model demonstrates improved ac-
curacy and computational efficiency.
Von Rueden et al. [133] describe the combination of machine learning and simulation towards a hybrid
modeling approach, suitable for applications based on both causal relationships and hidden dependen-
cies represented in data. The authors discuss various types of combinations using simulation-assisted
machine learning and machine learning-assisted simulation. Sadat et al. [134] developed a hybrid cryp-
tographic framework for secure and efficient regression analysis over distributed data, combining some-
what homomorphic encryption and Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX). The framework en-
sures privacy while maintaining computational efficiency. These modern methods are often more
flexible and powerful than traditional approaches, particularly in handling non-linear patterns, large
datasets, and real-time analysis. They require a good understanding of the underlying models and ap-
propriate preprocessing of data. The choice of method often depends on the specific characteristics of
the time series data and the objectives of the analysis.
In Table 1, we provide a comparison of traditional methods for time series modeling and discuss the
pros and cons of each approach. In Table 2, we provide a similar summary for modern approaches.
4. Long-Term Dependencies in Time Series Data
The temporal dependencies in time series data are crucial in various applications such as stock market
prediction and fault diagnosis. These dependencies can span timeframes of a few hours to a few years
making the analysis and classification of such data a challenging task. Time series data in energy sys-
tems, like wind turbines, inherently contain extremely long-term dependencies that are essential for
forming classifiable features and effective fault diagnosis [135]. Biomedical time series data, such as
EEG and ECG, do exhibit long-term dependencies, as demonstrated by Maiorana [136] in their study
on the longitudinal behavior of EEG signals. This was further supported by Nakano [137], who found
a relationship between the slowing of EEG and mental function decline in the elderly. The importance
of capturing these long-term dependencies in predicting clinical events was highlighted by Li [138],
who developed a hierarchical Transformer-based model for accurate prediction using longitudinal elec-
tronic health records. Zhao [139] also emphasized the need to retain sequential information in temporal
data, which is crucial for prediction tasks in the biomedical domain.
The studies by Thombs [140], Lutz [141], Kim [142], and Jackson [143] collectively suggest that time
series data from climate studies does exhibit long-term dependencies. Thombs and Kim both highlight
the importance of analyzing historical time series data and the need for alternative adjustment methods
to account for seasonality and long-term trends. Lutz and Jackson further emphasize the significance of
longitudinal data in understanding the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems and ecological
processes. These studies collectively underscore the presence of long-term dependencies in climate-
related time series data.
Time series data obtained from financial analysis, such as stock market and inflation data, often exhibit
long-term dependencies. This is due to the inherent nature of these data, which are characterized by
sequential observations over time. These dependencies can be attributed to various factors, including
the presence of heterogeneity, omitted variable bias, and duration dependence [144]. In the context of
stock trading markets, univariate time series models have been found to be effective in certain cases,

11
particularly in segments with sufficient historical data [145]. However, the effectiveness of these mod-
els may not be generalizable to all domains, particularly in forecasting after turning points. The presence
of serial dependency in time series data can pose challenges in analysis, particularly when conventional
methods that ignore this dependency are used [146]. Despite these challenges, time series analysis re-
mains a valuable tool for understanding the underlying processes and patterns of change in financial
data [147].
Despite these advancements, capturing long term dependencies and rare event detections is challenging.
Modeling long-term dependencies poses what amounts to a combinatorial problem. Until the introduc-
tion of the so-called Large Language Model (LLM), this was an elusive problem. The Transformer
model, which is based on an architecture that implements what is known as self-attention, has been a
disruptive force in machine learning.
4.1. Introduction to the Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture (Figure 4), introduced by Vaswani et al. [148], leverages self-attention
(scaled dot-product attention) as its core mechanism. This enables the model to assign importance
weights to different parts of the input sequence, unlike recurrent and convolutional layers. These
weights allow the Transformer to focus on relevant elements during processing, capturing long-range
dependencies effectively. Central to self-attention is the computation of attention weights, which deter-
mine which parts of the input sequence are most relevant for a particular element. This eliminates the
need for recurrent layers, which struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. In the original Trans-
former architecture, the input words or phrases are represented as vectors of real numbers in a high-
dimensional space. This process is called input embedding and during this process the information about
the order of the input sequence will be lost. Hence the authors introduced the concept of positional
encoding which generates a vector informing the model about element positions within the sequence.
In Scaled Dot-Product Attention, the attention weights are computed as a function of the query (𝑄) and
the key (𝐾) matrices, scaled by the dimension of the keys (𝑑 ):
"
𝑄𝐾#
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑄,𝐾,𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥9 ;𝑉 (2)
:𝑑
"
where 𝑄 is the matrix of queries, 𝐾 is the matrix of keys, 𝑉 is the matrix of values, and 𝑑 is the
"
dimensionality of the key vectors.
A Transformer architecture enhances the ability of the model to focus on different positions by employ-
ing multiple heads for the attention mechanism. Each head captures different aspects of the attention.
The output of each head is concatenated and linearly transformed into the desired dimensionality:
𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉) = Concat(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 ,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 ,......,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 )𝑊& (3)
$ ! %
ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 = 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛I𝑄𝑊 ( ,𝐾𝑊),𝑉𝑊*J (4)
' ' ' '
where 𝑊 ( ,𝑊+,𝑊* are the parameter matrices for 𝑖,% head, and 𝑊& is the output linear transfor-
' ' '
mation matrix.
In the original Transformer model, which is designed for natural language processing, positional en-
codings are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each
word in a sentence. This concept is crucial for time series analysis as well, where the order of data points
significantly impacts their meaning. For time series, positional encodings can be adapted to represent
the sequential nature of the data more accurately, ensuring the model recognizes the temporal order of
observations. This involves encoding not just the position within a sequence but also the actual time
intervals between observations, which can be particularly important in irregularly sampled time series.
Adjustments to the Transformer architecture, such as customizing the input and output layers or

12
integrating domain-specific features, can help the model better interpret and predict these continuous
values. By introducing mechanisms such as cyclic positional encodings into the model, a Transformer
can recognize and predict these cyclic patterns more effectively. Researchers have introduced various
modifications in the Transformer architecture, as shown in Figure 5, which enumerates application ar-
eas and domain specific architectures.
This review emphasizes applications in signal processing that addresses time series related tasks such
as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. The popular architectures used for such applica-
tions include LogTrans [149], InParformer [150], Informer [151], Sageformer [152], Autoformer [153],
Pyraformer [154], W-Transformers [155], FEDformer [156], Crossformer [157], Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) [158], [159], [160], and Transformer-XL [161].
4.2. LogTrans
The LogTrans architecture introduces an architecture that provides a combination of Transformer ar-
chitecture and CNN parallel network for biomedical image segmentation [149]. CNNs excel at learning
local dependencies within images. However, they tend to lack a broader understanding of the overall
structure and relationships between different regions and components. LogTrans offers a hybrid ap-
proach using parallel branches consisting of a CNN and a transformer. The CNN branch focuses on
extracting localized features (textures, edges, specific cell patterns), whereas the transformer branch
specializes in learning global spatial relationships and contextual information.
The Separate-Combiner (SeCo) module is the heart of the LogTrans architecture. Instead of just jam-
ming outputs from the two branches together, this module does two things: (1) separate – allows CNN
and transformer features to further refine on their own, emphasizing relevant patterns for their specific
focus; and (2) combiner: strategically fuses the refined features, enriching the representation. This gives
the resulting segmentation the best of both worlds.
The LogTrans framework was evaluated on several biomedical datasets, including ablation studies on
ISIC-2017 and UITNS-2022 as shown in Table 3.
4.3. Temporal Fusion Transformer
The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [139], [158], [160], [162], shown in Figure 7, integrates sev-
eral components to handle different types of data and temporal relationships effectively. The core com-
ponents include Gated Residual Networks, Variable Selection Networks, LSTM encoders, Multi-Head
Attention, and Quantile forecasts. This architecture allows TFT to capture complex temporal patterns,
handle missing data, and provide uncertainty estimates for forecasts. It is particularly effective in multi-
horizon forecasting tasks, where predictions are needed over multiple future time steps.
B. Lim et al. [158] introduces an attention-based architecture for multi-horizon forecasting that com-
bines high performance with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. TFT uses recurrent layers
for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. The architecture
includes specialized components to select relevant features and gating layers to suppress unnecessary
components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. The architectural innovations
include gating mechanisms that allow the model to adaptively manage its depth and complexity, ena-
bling efficient information processing across different scenarios without overfitting to less relevant data
components.
The variable selection networks play a crucial role in identifying and focusing on the most relevant
input variables for each forecasting step, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy and interpretability.
TFT integrates information from static metadata using separate gated residual network (GRN) encoders
to produce four different context vectors that are wired into various locations in temporal fusion de-
coder. TFT integrates vital background information into the forecasting process, allowing the model to
condition its temporal dynamics on these static inputs. The model employs a combination of sequence-

13
to-sequence layers for local processing and an interpretable multi-head attention mechanism to capture
long-term dependencies, offering a comprehensive understanding of both short and long-term temporal
relationships. By generating prediction intervals, TFT provides valuable insights into the possible range
of future values, enhancing decision-making processes with a clearer assessment of risk and uncertainty.
Fabian et.al. [160] examines the importance of accurate thermal load forecasting for district heating and
cooling networks and evaluates the performance of the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) in this
context, presenting its use for producing 72-hour heating load forecasts for three different district heat-
ing grids in the city of ULM. Comparing TFT's performance with other machine learning methods,
superior forecasting abilities across various scenarios, significantly in the spring and fall seasons, was
demonstrated. This improvement is attributed to TFT's attention-based mechanism, which excels in
handling the temporal nature of the data and its ability to generalize across different conditions. The
research underscores TFT's potential in optimizing the use of renewable energy and reducing reliance
on fossil fuels in district heating systems. TFT consistently outperformed other methods in terms of
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across all district heating networks. The study found that, in
the spring, TFT's MAPE improvement ranged from 2% better for one network to 8% better for another,
highlighting its robustness even in harder-to-predict seasons.
Ratchakit et al. [159] applies TFT to forecast vital sign trajectories in intensive care patients, focusing
on heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). The results show that TFT
could effectively forecast vital sign trajectories, such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), in
intensive care patients. The model could provide accurate future vital signs predictions, with most un-
seen values falling within the 95% prediction interval. The study highlights TFT's ability to capture
temporal dynamics and potential in detecting irregular patterns in vital sign time series, suggesting its
usefulness in clinical settings for early detection of patient deterioration.
Behrens et al. [160] explored TFT for thermal load prediction in district heating and cooling networks,
providing a comparison with other machine learning methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in
forecasting heating load for different grids. Liao & Radhakrishnan [162] tested the TFT approach for
short-term load forecasting in power distribution networks, showing its effectiveness over traditional
methods.
4.4. InParformer
InParformer [150] is another model based on transformer architecture for long-term time series fore-
casting. The architecture, shown in Figure 8, It features an interactive parallel attention mechanism for
learning dependencies in both frequency and time domains, enhanced by query selection, key-value
pair compression, and evolutionary seasonal-trend decomposition modules. These innovations target
the challenges of redundancy, semantic density, and complex temporal patterns in time series data. The
methodology emphasizes efficiency and interpretability, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
models across various real-world datasets.
InParformer demonstrates remarkable performance in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) across
various datasets and metrics. This performance is highlighted by its comparison with other state-of-the-
art models such as FEDformer, Autoformer, Informer, and others, offering a comprehensive view of its
capabilities. InParformer consistently outperformed competing models across multiple datasets, includ-
ing ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature), Electricity, Exchange, and Weather datasets, showcas-
ing its versatility and robustness in handling different types of time series data. The model achieved
significant reductions in Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), indicating its
precise forecasting ability. For instance, in the ETTm2 dataset, InParformer achieved an MSE of 0.260
and an MAE of 0.323 for a prediction length of 192, outperforming FEDformer, which had an MSE of
0.269 and an MAE of 0.328 for the same prediction length.
Similarly, in the Exchange dataset, InParformer outperformed other models with an MSE reduction of
up to 15.1% compared to FEDformer, highlighting its efficiency in datasets lacking clear periodicity.

14
These results underscore InParformer's advanced design, incorporating interactive parallel attention and
evolutionary seasonal-trend decomposition, which enables it to capture complex temporal dependencies
more effectively than its counterparts. Its superior performance across diverse forecasting horizons fur-
ther emphasizes its stability and adaptability in varying temporal resolutions.
4.5. Informer
The Informer model, shown in Figure 9, is designed to handle the high prediction capacity required for
capturing long-range dependencies between input and output efficiently. Informer addresses several
problems with the traditional transformer model, such as quadratic time complexity, high memory us-
age, and limitations of the encoder-decoder architecture. To overcome these, Informer introduces three
key innovations: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism that reduces time complexity and memory
usage to O(L log L) while maintaining performance, (ii) self-attention distilling that emphasizes domi-
nant attention and manages extremely long input sequences effectively, and (iii) a generative style de-
coder that predicts long time series sequences in one forward operation, significantly speeding up in-
ference for long-sequence predictions. The Informer model demonstrates superior performance over
existing methods through extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets [156].
An important variant of the Informer architecture is the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer,
FedFormer, which aims to improve long-term series forecasting by combining a transformer model with
seasonal-trend decomposition with a frequency enhancement model to handle short-term details. FED-
former is shown to be more effective and efficient than the standard transformer, with a linear complex-
ity to sequence length, and it reduces prediction error significantly on benchmark datasets [163]. How-
ever, the Informer's distinctive characteristics, particularly its ProbSparse self-attention mechanism and
generative style decoder, are unique solutions to the specific challenges of modeling long-term depend-
encies, and this are not addressed by the FEDformer approach.
4.6. Sageformer
The Series-Aware Framework for Long-Term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting architecture,
known as SageFormer, introduces a novel framework for forecasting multivariate time series (MTS)
data. MTS data are quite common with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices
generate vast amounts of MTS data, necessitating advanced forecasting models capable of understand-
ing the intricate interplays and temporal dynamics within this data. Long-term fore casting of MTS data
is particularly challenging due to the need to capture both intra- and inter-series dependencies accu-
rately.
SageFormer, shown in Figure 10, leverages graph structures to discern and model complex relationships
between different series, capturing diverse temporal patterns while filtering out redundant information.
The framework integrates seamlessly with existing transformer-based models, enhancing their ability
to understand inter-series relationships. This integration enriches the models without significantly in-
creasing complexity. Through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, SageFormer
demonstrates superior forecasting performance compared to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches.
Unlike in traditional Transformer architecture where input token are obtained by projecting input time
series in a patch, the Sageformer integrates global tokens to enhance series awareness [152]. It uses an
iterative message-passing process shown in Figure 11. Graph Structure Learning employs end-to-end
learning of the adjacency matrix to capture relationships across series without prior knowledge, making
it versatile for different datasets. Experiments on six real-world datasets (e.g., Traffic, Electricity,
Weather) and two synthetic datasets, were conducted demonstrating SageFormer's effectiveness across
various domains. SageFormer outperforms nine popular models for long-term MTS forecasting models,
including models that focus on inter-series dependencies and long-term context using transformers.

15
4.7. Autoformer
The Autoformer approach [148] is a variation of the transformer architecture that includes a deep de-
composition architecture, as shown in Figure 12. The Autoformer consists of an inner series decompo-
sition block, an autocorrelation mechanism, and a corresponding encoder and decoder. The Autoformer
features an autocorrelation mechanism inspired by stochastic process theory, which focuses on the pe-
riodicity of the series to discover dependencies and aggregate representations at the sub-series level.
This mechanism is more efficient and accurate than traditional self-attention, particularly for long-term
forecasting tasks.
The Autoformer achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement over existing
methods on six benchmark datasets that span five practical applications, including energy, traffic, eco-
nomics, weather, and disease [164]. These datasets included (i) load and oil temperature data from an
electric transformer, (ii) an electricity dataset that contains the hourly electricity consumption, (iii) ex-
change records of the daily exchange rates of eight different countries, (iv) hourly traffic data from
California Department of Transportation, (v) weather recorded every 10 minutes for the year 2020 con-
taining 21 meteorological indicators, and (vi) weekly recorded influenza like illness (ILI) patients data
from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States. For the multivariate setting,
Autoformer achieved state of the art performance for all benchmarks and all prediction length settings.
Autoformer gave a 74% MSE reduction in ETT, 18% in electricity, 61% in exchange, 15% in traffic
and 21% in weather. For the input 36-predict-60 setting of ILI, Autoformer delivered a 43% MSE re-
duction. Overall, Autoformer yielded a 38% averaged MSE reduction.
4.8. Pyraformer
In Pyraformer, a novel pyramidal attention-based transformer is proposed to bridge the gap between
capturing the long-range dependencies and achieving a low time and space complexity [154]. Specifi-
cally, a pyramidal attention mechanism is developed by passing messages based on attention in the
pyramidal graph as shown in Figure 13.
The edges in this graph can be divided into two groups: the inter-scale and the intra-scale connections.
The inter-scale connections build a multiresolution representation of the original sequence: nodes at the
finest scale correspond to the time points in the original time series (e.g., hourly observations), while
nodes in the coarser scales represent features with lower resolutions (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly
patterns). Such latent coarser scale nodes are initially introduced via a coarser-scale construction mod-
ule. On the other hand, the intra-scale edges capture the temporal dependencies at each resolution by
connecting neighboring nodes together. As a result, this model provides a compact representation for
long-range temporal dependencies among far-apart positions by capturing such behavior at coarser res-
olutions, leading to a smaller length of the signal traversing path. Moreover, modeling temporal de-
pendencies of different ranges at different scales with sparse neighboring intra-scale connections sig-
nificantly reduces the computational cost.
At the heart of Pyraformer is its hierarchical attention mechanism shown in Figure 14, which processes
data in a pyramidal fashion. This design reduces the computation required for long sequences by sum-
marizing information at multiple scales and then integrating these summaries to capture long-range
dependencies. By leveraging this pyramidal structure, Pyraformer significantly reduces the time and
space complexity associated with processing long sequences. This efficiency makes it a practical choice
for large-scale applications where computational resources are a limiting factor. The architecture's de-
sign is inherently adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications beyond just text pro-
cessing. It has shown promising results in time series forecasting, where capturing long-range depend-
encies is crucial for accurate predictions.
The Pyraformer model has been evaluated across multiple datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and
efficiency. It has been observed to deliver an improvement in MSE and MAE while tested with three
different datasets: Electricity [165], ETTh1 and ETTm1 [151]. For ETTh1, Pyraformer decreased the

16
MSE by 24.8%, 28.9%, 26.2% respectively when the prediction length is 168, 336, and 720. In appli-
cations ranging from financial market prediction to weather forecasting and natural language tasks,
Pyraformer's innovative approach offers a balance between performance and efficiency.
4.9. W-Transformers
The W-Transformer is a wavelet-based transformer framework that marks a significant advancement in
univariate time series forecasting. This framework, shown in Figure 15, leverages the maximal overlap
discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) to decompose time series data, enabling the capture of non-
stationary and long-range nonlinear dependencies. The W-Transformer framework is designed to tackle
the challenges of forecasting non-stationary time series data, which is a common scenario in real-world
applications. Non-stationarity in time series data, characterized by changes in mean and variance over
time, poses significant challenges for traditional forecasting models.
W-Transformers address this challenge by incorporating wavelet transformations with the Transformer
architecture, allowing for the efficient capture of both local and global temporal dependencies in the
data. The MODWT is employed as a preprocessing step to decompose the time series data into various
frequency components. This decomposition allows the W-Transformer to analyze the data at multiple
resolutions, capturing the inherent multi-scale temporal dynamics. The wavelet transformation's ability
to handle non-stationarity makes it an ideal choice for preprocessing time series data for forecasting
tasks. The W-Transformer architecture exhibited superior performance in root mean square error
(RMSE) on four different datasets as shown in Table 4.
4.10. FedFormer
Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer for Long-term Series Forecasting (FEDformer) [156],
is a novel architecture for long-term series forecasting. Its architecture is shown in Figure 16. FED-
former combines transformer models with seasonal-trend decomposition and frequency domain analy-
sis to enhance forecasting accuracy. By incorporating Fourier and wavelet transforms, FEDformer
achieves linear computational complexity, outperforming state-of-the-art models in efficiency and ac-
curacy across multiple datasets. The approach addresses the limitations of traditional transformer mod-
els in capturing global time series trends, offering significant improvements in multivariate and univari-
ate forecasting tasks.
The FEDformer architecture introduces a dual-path design integrating both Fourier and wavelet trans-
forms to enhance time series forecasting. This structure allows for efficient processing of long se-
quences by decomposing them into frequency components, enabling the model to capture both global
and local temporal dependencies with reduced computational complexity. The innovative use of fre-
quency-enhanced attention mechanisms in FEDformer facilitates a more effective and scalable ap-
proach to long-term forecasting tasks.
The FEDformer model's performance was evaluated using six datasets covering a range of real-world
scenarios including energy, economics, traffic, weather, and disease. FEDformer outperformed all other
models on the six benchmark datasets across all prediction horizons, with an overall 14.8% relative
MSE reduction compared to Autoformer. Notably, for some datasets like Exchange and ILI, the im-
provement was even more significant, exceeding 20%. This showcases FEDformer's strength in long-
term forecasting and its ability to handle data without clear periodicity effectively. In univariate time
series forecasting, FEDformer achieved an overall 22.6% relative MSE reduction compared to Auto-
former [153]. For certain datasets, such as traffic data, the improvement exceeded 30%. This further
validates FEDformer's effectiveness in long-term forecasting. The model's dual-path structure, utilizing
both Fourier and wavelet transforms (denoted as FEDformer-f and FEDformer-w), allows it to excel
across different datasets by leveraging their complementary strengths.

17
4.11. CrossFormer++
CrossFormer++ [157], is an enhanced vision transformer leveraging cross-scale attention for improved
performance in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmenta-
tion tasks. It introduces a cross-scale embedding layer (CEL) and long-short distance attention (LSDA)
for efficient feature processing across scales. Additionally, it addresses issues like self-attention map
enlargement and amplitude explosion with a progressive group size (PGS) and an amplitude cooling
layer (ACL), respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate CrossFormer++'s superior performance
across various tasks compared to existing models.
CrossFormer++ employs a pyramid structure that organizes the transformer model into four stages as
shown in Figure 17. Each stage is designed to progressively refine the features extracted from the input
image, allowing for a hierarchical representation that captures both local and global contextual infor-
mation effectively.
At the beginning of each stage, a Cross-scale Embedding Layer (CEL) is utilized to generate input
tokens. The CEL operates by sampling patches from the input image using four different kernel sizes,
allowing it to capture features at multiple scales. This multi-scale approach enables the model to main-
tain a balance between computational efficiency and the ability to capture detailed feature information
from various parts of the image.
Within each CrossFormer block, the Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA) module is a key compo-
nent. LSDA is divided into Short Distance Attention (SDA) and Long Distance Attention (LDA) mech-
anisms. SDA focuses on building dependencies among neighboring embeddings, capturing local feature
information efficiently. Conversely, LDA is responsible for establishing connections between embed-
dings that are far apart, enabling the model to integrate global contextual information. This dual atten-
tion mechanism allows CrossFormer++ to effectively process visual information across different spatial
ranges.
To enhance the model's ability to understand the positional relationship between different tokens, Cross-
Former++ incorporates a Dynamic Position Bias (DPB) module. This module adapts the relative posi-
tion bias to accommodate variable image and group sizes, ensuring that positional information is accu-
rately captured regardless of the input dimensions. This flexibility is crucial for tasks like object
detection, where the input image size can vary significantly.
Two additional innovations in CrossFormer++ are the Progressive Group Size (PGS) and the Amplitude
Cooling Layer (ACL). PGS addresses the varying attention needs at different layers of the model by
adjusting the group size progressively. This ensures that local features are emphasized in early layers,
while global features are prioritized in deeper layers. The ACL is introduced to manage the amplifica-
tion of activation amplitudes across layers, which can destabilize training. By cooling down the ampli-
tude, ACL helps maintain training stability and improve model performance.
On ImageNet data, CrossFormer++ models achieve a noticeable improvement in accuracy over existing
vision transformers and their predecessors (CrossFormer models), with gains up to 0.8% in average
accuracy across different model sizes [157]. For instance, CrossFormer++-B achieves 84.2% accuracy.
CrossFormer++ significantly outperforms most existing vision transformers in object detection and in-
stance segmentation tasks on the COCO 2017 dataset. CrossFormer++ surpasses CrossFormer by at
least 0.5% average precision (AP). The semantic segmentation task on the ADE20K dataset exhibits
greater performance gains over other architectures as the model size increases, indicating its effective-
ness in dense prediction tasks.
4.12. Transformer-XL
Transformer-XL [161] introduces a novel approach to language modeling, enabling the capture of
longer-term dependencies beyond fixed-length contexts. It achieves this through a segment-level

18
recurrence mechanism and a new positional encoding scheme, significantly improving performance
over traditional models like RNNs and vanilla transformers. Transformer-XL demonstrates its effec-
tiveness across various datasets, significantly reducing perplexity and enhancing text generation quality.
This model represents a substantial advancement in handling sequential data, offering promising appli-
cations in areas requiring nuanced understanding of long-term context.
Transformer-XL incorporates a recurrence mechanism at the segment level, allowing the model to carry
over information from previous segments. This design enables the model to maintain a longer effective
context without being limited by the fixed size of input segments. During training, hidden states from
previous segments are reused as extended context for the current segment, enhancing the model's ability
to capture long-term dependencies. This approach addresses both the limitations of fixed-length con-
texts and the context fragmentation problem, leading to improved modeling of longer sequences.
A crucial innovation in Transformer-XL is the introduction of relative positional encodings, which re-
place the absolute positional encodings used in standard transformers. This change is necessary to main-
tain the coherence of positional information when reusing hidden states across segments. Relative po-
sitional encodings allow the model to understand the relative positions of tokens within a sequence,
enabling the reuse of states without causing confusion about the temporal order of events. This tech-
nique not only preserves temporal information but also allows for more flexible and efficient handling
of sequence lengths.
Transformer-XL reduced the state-of-the-art (SoTA) perplexity from 20.5 to 18.3, on WikiText-103
[166], showcasing its superiority over previous models in capturing long-term dependencies in a large
dataset with an average article length of 3.6K tokens [161]. On the enwik8 dataset [167] that contains
100M bytes of unprocessed Wikipedia text, Transformer-XL achieved new SoTA results, outperform-
ing previous Transformer models and conventional RNN-based models by a significant margin. Nota-
bly, the 12-layer Transformer-XL matched the performance of a 64-layer network from a previous study
with only 17% of the parameter budget, emphasizing its efficiency [161].
Similar to enwik8, text8 contains 100M processed Wikipedia characters created by lowering case the
text and removing any character other than the 26 letters a through z, and space. Transformer-XL
adapted the same model and hyper-parameters from enwik8, achieving the new SoTA from 1.13 to 1.08
[161]. Transformer-XL significantly improved the SoTA from 23.7 to 21.8 [161]on the One Billion
Word dataset [168], indicating its generalizability and effectiveness in modeling both short and long
sequences.
5. Conclusion
In this review, we have explored advanced machine learning models for modeling long-term context.
We have focused on enhanced transformer architectures that can solve important challenges such as
biomedical image segmentation, time series forecasting, and language modeling. Innovations such as
the LogTrans architecture, which combine CNNs with transformers were shown to be superior to stand-
ard transformer architectures. Other architectures, like Autoformer and CrossFormer++, introduce
mechanisms for capturing periodicity and cross-scale features. These advancements signify major
strides in accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of transformers across different domains, showcasing
their versatility and potential for future research and applications. Table 5 provides a comparison of key
features and advancements of these architectures.
In this chapter we covered both classical and modern approaches to modeling long-term context. Char-
acteristics like autocorrelation, trend, and seasonality in time series data across various domains were
discussed. Classical methods such as autoregressive models, moving averages, and Box-Jenkins meth-
odology, as well as modern techniques like RNNs, CNNs and LSTMs were discussed.
This review underscores the importance of capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. It
highlights studies demonstrating the effectiveness of capturing these dependencies for accurate

19
prediction and classification. Central to these models is the transformer architecture that allows the
system to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, effectively capturing long-term dependencies
without the limitations of recurrent layers. This review also explores applications of transformer varia-
tions in signal processing for tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection, showcas-
ing architectures like LogTrans, Informer, and Temporal Fusion Transformers. It compares traditional
methods and modern approaches, highlighting their applications, advantages, and disadvantages.
The future of attention-based models and transformer architectures are promising due to its emphasis
on domain-specific adaptations, hybrid model development, and possible improvement in optimiza-
tions. We may expect advancements in transformer encoding techniques to capture temporal relation-
ships more effectively. Authors have proposed such an approach of detecting rare events in extremely
long time series data. Additionally, research will explore integrating established time series methods
within transformer frameworks. Another focus will be on quantifying the uncertainty in forecasting
problems, enabling more reliable decision support systems. Advancements in handling multivariate
time series with transformers are another area that will unlock the analysis of complex interdependent
systems. Research on optimizing computational efficiency will be equally important for deploying
transformer based models in real-time as well as resource-constrained time series applications.

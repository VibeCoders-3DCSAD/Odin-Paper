Public budgets, which lie at the core of fiscal management (Derrick 2002; Danninger 2005) depend critically on the
systems, function both as instruments of economic policy and accuracy of forecasts. Moreover, forecasts serve as key in-
as frameworks for managing public resources. The forecasts dicators for economic agents: various financial indicators,
used in budget preparation determine the government's future particularly interest rates, are influenced by these forecasts;

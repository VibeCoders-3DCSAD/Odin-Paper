Abstract

The  rapid  expansion  of  India's  digital  payment  ecosystem—encompassing  Unified  Payments  Interface  (UPI)
transactions  exceeding  14  billion  monthly,  e-banking  services,  and  mobile  wallet  platforms—has  created  an
unprecedented volume of personal financial data. Despite abundant data, most individuals lack effective tools to
interpret and act on this information. Traditional budgeting methods, including manual record-keeping and basic
mobile applications, fail to deliver real-time, context-aware insights that modern users require for sound financial
decision-making. This paper presents Spend AI, a full-stack AI-powered personal finance management platform
built  on  Next.js  14,  Prisma  ORM,  Supabase  PostgreSQL,  and  Clerk  authentication.  The  system  integrates
Google's  Gemini  large  language  model  (LLM)  to  deliver  automated  transaction  categorization,  anomaly
detection,  predictive  expense  forecasting,  and  natural-language  financial  insights.  Experimental  evaluation
demonstrates that the platform achieves over 91% accuracy in transaction categorization and reduces manual
expense-logging  effort  by  approximately  78%  compared  to  conventional  approaches.  The  architecture
addresses  key  limitations  identified  in  prior  research—namely,  limited  explainability,  single-source  data
dependency,  and  lack  of  personalization—by  employing  a  modular  AI  pipeline  capable  of  processing
heterogeneous financial inputs. Results confirm that conversational AI-driven interfaces significantly enhance
users' financial literacy and budgeting discipline.

I. Introduction

The digital transformation of financial services has fundamentally altered how individuals interact with money. In
India alone, UPI transactions surpassed 131 billion in fiscal year 2023-24, while mobile wallet adoption continues
to grow at double-digit rates annually. As a consequence, individuals routinely generate substantial volumes of
transactional  data  across  multiple  platforms—bank  accounts,  digital  wallets,  credit  cards,  and  subscription
services—yet lack unified, intelligent tools to synthesize this information into actionable guidance.[1][2]

Research  consistently  demonstrates  that  financial  stress  is  among  the  most  pervasive  sources  of  individual
anxiety,  with  studies  indicating  that  poor  financial  management  contributes  to  reduced  productivity,  adverse
mental  health  outcomes,  and  long-term  wealth  erosion.  However,  the  personal  finance  software  market  has
historically been dominated by either simple tracking tools that require manual data entry or enterprise-grade
solutions inaccessible to the average user.[3]

Advances  in artificial  intelligence—particularly  in  large  language  models  (LLMs)  and  machine  learning-based
classification—now make it feasible to build consumer-grade financial management platforms that combine the
analytical depth of institutional tools with the accessibility of consumer applications. Recent work by Hean et al.
(2025) demonstrates that leading LLMs, including Google's Gemini, exhibit meaningful capability in addressing
personal  finance  queries  across  topics  such  as  credit  management,  savings  strategies,  and  investment
fundamentals.[4]

This paper presents Spend AI, a Next.js-based full-stack web application that addresses three critical gaps in
existing  solutions:  (i)  the  absence  of  automated,  real-time  transaction  categorization  powered  by  machine
learning; (ii) the lack of personalized, natural-language financial insights adapted to individual spending patterns;
and (iii) the inability to generate forward-looking predictive budgets using time-series forecasting. The platform
is  designed  for  Indian  users  navigating  a  multi-channel  digital  payment  landscape,  though  its  architecture
generalizes to any context with similar financial data density.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews relevant literature. Section III describes
the  proposed  system  architecture.  Section  IV  outlines  the  research  methodology.  Section  V  details
implementation.  Section  VI  presents  results  and  discussion.  Sections  VII  and  VIII  address  advantages,
limitations, and future scope. Section IX concludes.

II. Literature Review

A systematic review of literature spanning personal finance management, AI-driven financial platforms, machine
learning for transaction analysis, and LLM applications in finance reveals both significant progress and persistent
limitations that motivate the present work.

A. AI-Driven Personal Finance Management

Verma  et  al.  (2024)  developed a  Next.js  and  PostgreSQL-based personal finance  tracker  demonstrating  the
viability  of  modern  web  frameworks  for  financial  applications;  however,  their  system  lacked  AI-driven
categorization and relied entirely on manual transaction entry. [1] Aishwarya and Hemalatha (2023) proposed a
smart expense tracking system using supervised machine learning, achieving strong classification performance
but without integration of generative AI for natural-language insights.[5]

Stefanov et al. (2024) examined mobile-based personal finance management, identifying scalability and cross-
platform accessibility as critical requirements not met by native Android applications.[6] A broader survey by IRJET
(2024) on AI-driven personal finance management systems found that while several prototype systems exist,
the  majority  suffer  from  limited  personalization,  opaque  recommendation  logic,  and  poor  support  for  multi-
channel financial data.[7]

The "Budget Buddy" system described in IJARCCE (2025) represents a closer antecedent to the present work,
integrating  Google  Generative  AI  for  receipt  scanning,  Clerk  Authentication,  and  Supabase  as  a  backend—
demonstrating the maturity of this technology stack for consumer finance applications. [8]

B. Machine Learning for Transaction Categorization

Kou et al.  (2021) demonstrated  that ensemble  machine  learning  methods—including  Random  Forest,  LSTM
networks,  and  Gradient  Boosting—substantially  outperform  rule-based  approaches  for  financial  pattern
recognition, particularly when applied to large, heterogeneous transaction datasets. [9]

Kotios et al. (2022) proposed a hybrid deep learning approach  combining transaction classification with cash
flow prediction  using  Recurrent  Neural  Networks,  and further  incorporated  explainable AI  (XAI)  techniques—
LIME  and  SHAP—to  interpret  classification  results.  Their  work  underscores  that  transparency  in  ML-based
financial systems is not merely a regulatory concern but a key driver of user trust. [10]

Research  on  SME  transaction  categorization  highlights  that  LSTM  architectures  with  anomaly  detection
mechanisms provide strong performance for sequential financial  data, though they require substantial labeled
datasets  and  struggle  with  cold-start  scenarios  for  new  users—a  challenge  directly  relevant  to  consumer
personal finance applications.[11]

C. Large Language Models in Financial Applications

The application of LLMs to financial tasks has expanded rapidly since 2022. Li et al. (2023) surveyed LLMs in
finance, identifying key capabilities including text summarization of financial reports, sentiment analysis of market
news, and question-answering over financial documents.[12]

Hean et al. (2025) conducted a comparative evaluation of leading LLMs—including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and Llama—on personal finance tasks spanning credit management, savings guidance, and budgeting. Their
findings reveal that while GPT-4 achieves high performance across domains, Gemini demonstrates competitive
capability  for  financial  advisory  tasks,  making  it  a  suitable  choice  for  consumer-facing  financial  intelligence
applications.[4]

Pancholi et al. (2026) proposed an end-to-end multi-agent AI system for personal finance integrating a CTGAN-
based  synthetic  transaction  generator,  a  constrained  optimization  budgeting  agent,  and  an  LLM-driven
investment advisor—demonstrating the feasibility of composing multiple AI components into a unified personal
finance system.[13]

A comprehensive review of generative AI in finance by MDPI (2024) identifies three primary application clusters:
natural  language  processing  for  financial  text,  synthetic  data  generation,  and  decision-support  systems.  The
review highlights that while LLMs show promise for personalized financial advice, issues of hallucination, factual
reliability, and regulatory compliance remain active research challenges. [14]

D. Identified Gaps and Research Motivation

The  reviewed  literature  reveals  three  primary  gaps  that  motivate  the  present  work.  First,  existing  consumer
personal finance tools rarely combine automated ML-based categorization with LLM-generated natural-language
insights in a single, production-ready platform. Second, most prior systems are either research prototypes lacking
deployment infrastructure or commercial products whose internal architectures are opaque. Third, few systems
address  the  specific  context  of  Indian  digital  payment  ecosystems,  where  multi-channel  transactions  (UPI,
wallets, bank transfers, cards) require flexible, context-aware categorization schemas. Spend AI is designed to
bridge these gaps.

III. Proposed System

A. System Overview

Spend  AI  is  a  cloud-hosted,  full-stack  web  application  that  automates  personal  financial  management  by
integrating machine learning-based transaction processing with LLM-powered insight generation. The platform
provides the following core capabilities:

•  Automated transaction categorization using supervised ML models
•  Personalized financial insights and spending warnings via Gemini LLM
•  Predictive expense forecasting using time-series modelling
•
Interactive dashboards with real-time visual analytics
•  Budget management with dynamic threshold alerting
•  Multi-modal data ingestion supporting manual entry, CSV import, and receipt scanning
•  Secure, cloud-based data storage with row-level access control

B. System Workflow

Fig. 1: End-to-End User Workflow of Spend AI

The end-to-end workflow proceeds through the following stages:

1.  User authenticates via Clerk SDK (email or Google OAuth).

2.  User adds or imports transaction records (amount, date, merchant, category override).
3.  The ML Categorization Engine automatically classifies each transaction into one of eighteen predefined

spending categories.

4.  The Dashboard Analytics Module aggregates categorized transactions into summary statistics, trend

charts, and category-wise breakdowns.

5.  The AI Insight Engine (Gemini LLM) analyses aggregated financial data and generates natural-

language insights including spending warnings, budget recommendations, anomaly alerts, and monthly
summaries.

6.  The Prediction Module applies time-series forecasting to project next-month expenditure by category.

7.  Budget alerts are triggered dynamically when spending approaches or exceeds configured thresholds

(80% and 100% of budget).

IV. System Architecture

A. Layered Architecture

Fig. 2: Five-Layer System Architecture of Spend AI

The platform employs a five-layer modular architecture, each layer with clearly defined responsibilities, enabling
independent scaling and maintenance:

•  Presentation Layer: Next.js 14 App Router with React Server Components and ShadCN UI for high-

fidelity, accessible interfaces.

•  Business Logic Layer: Next.js Server Actions and API routes providing type-safe, server-executed logic

without a separate backend service.

•  AI Layer: Machine learning models for transaction categorization and anomaly detection, integrated

with the Gemini API for natural-language insight generation.

•  Data Layer: Prisma ORM with Supabase PostgreSQL, featuring row-level security (RLS) policies

enforcing strict per-user data isolation.

•  Authentication Layer: Clerk SDK providing enterprise-grade identity management, supporting

email/password and Google OAuth flows.

B. Key Architectural Decisions

Fig. 3: Technology Stack Overview

Several critical architectural decisions distinguish this platform from prior work. The choice of Next.js 14's App
Router architecture enables co-location of server-side logic with frontend components, eliminating the latency
and  complexity  of  a  separate  backend  service  while  maintaining  the  security  guarantees  of  server-executed
code.[1]

Supabase was selected as the database layer for its native row-level security capabilities, which enforce data
access policies at the database level rather than relying solely on application-level controls—a critical property
for a system handling sensitive financial data.[8]

The  integration  of  Gemini  as  the  LLM  engine  follows  empirical  evidence  that  Google's  model  demonstrates
competitive  performance on  personal finance tasks,  including  credit  concepts and budgeting  guidance,  while
offering a favourable cost-to-capability ratio for consumer applications.[4]

C. Database Schema

The  core  data  model  comprises  three  primary  entities:  User  (managed  by  Clerk,  referenced  by  clerk_id),
Transaction (amount, date, merchant, category, notes, user_id), and Budget (category, monthly_limit, user_id).
Foreign  key  constraints  and  cascading  deletes  are  enforced  at  the  database  level,  with  Prisma  schema
migrations managing versioned schema evolution.

V. Research Methodology

A. Data Collection

The platform is designed to ingest financial data from multiple sources, reflecting the multi-channel nature of
modern Indian digital payments. Primary data sources include: (i) manual transaction entry via the web interface;
(ii)  bulk  CSV  import from  bank  statements and  payment  platforms;  and  (iii)  OCR-based  receipt  scanning for
offline purchase  capture. Each  transaction  record  is  timestamped,  linked  to a user  identifier, and assigned a
provisional category by the ML model pending user confirmation or override. [5]

B. Data Preprocessing

Raw  transaction  data  undergoes  a  multi-stage  preprocessing  pipeline  before  analysis.  Text  normalization  is
applied to merchant names to resolve common abbreviations and transliterations (particularly relevant for Indian
payment descriptions containing UPI reference identifiers). Feature engineering derives temporal attributes—
day of week, week of month, month, and quarter—from transaction timestamps, which serve as inputs to both
the categorization model and the forecasting module.[9]

Categorical  features  are  encoded  using  target  encoding  for  high-cardinality  merchant  fields,  while  numerical
features (transaction amounts) are normalized using min-max scaling within user-specific ranges to account for
the substantial variation in spending levels across the user population.

C. AI Categorization Model

Transaction  categorization  is  implemented  as  a  multi-class  text  classification  task.  A  gradient-boosted  tree
classifier (XGBoost) is trained on a corpus of labelled personal finance transactions, augmented with synthetic
data  generated  using  techniques  drawn  from  the  literature  on  imbalanced  financial  datasets. [10][13]  The  model
maps each transaction—characterized by merchant name, transaction amount, and temporal features—to one
of eighteen spending categories (e.g., Food & Dining, Transport, Utilities, Entertainment, Healthcare, Savings,
Investment).  User  overrides  of  model  predictions  are  used  as  online  feedback  to  fine-tune  category  priors,
enabling personalization over time.

D. LLM Integration for Insight Generation

Fig. 4: AI Insight Generation Pipeline (RAG Pattern)

The AI Insight Engine queries the Gemini API with structured prompts derived from aggregated user financial
data. Prompt construction follows a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern, where user-specific spending
summaries,  budget  utilization  metrics,  and  detected  anomalies  are  injected  into  the  prompt  context.  This
approach,  consistent  with  best  practices  identified  in  recent  meta-analyses  of  LLM  prompting  in  finance,
mitigates  hallucination  by  grounding  the  model's  reasoning  in  verifiable  user  data  rather  than  parametric
knowledge.[14][23]

E. Predictive Forecasting

Monthly expense forecasting is implemented using a Prophet-based time-series model, trained on each user's
historical transaction data by  category.  The  model  decomposes  spending  trends  into  trend,  seasonality,  and
holiday components, producing point forecasts and 90% credible intervals for the following month's expenditure.
This  design  follows  the  literature  on  LSTM  and  time-series  forecasting  for  personal  finance,  adapting  the
methodology to operate effectively with the limited historical data typically available for new users.[11][19]

VI. Implementation

A. Frontend Technologies

The user interface is implemented using the following technology stack:

•  Next.js 14 (App Router) — Server and client component architecture with streaming support for AI-

generated content.

•  React.js — Component-based UI structure enabling reusable, testable interface elements.
•  Tailwind CSS — Utility-first responsive styling for consistent cross-device rendering.
•  ShadCN UI — Accessible, pre-built component library extending Radix UI primitives.
•  Recharts / Chart.js — Interactive data visualization for financial dashboards and trend analytics.

B. Backend and Data Technologies

Server-side logic and data management employ:

•  Next.js Server Actions — Type-safe, server-executed business logic collocated with frontend

components, eliminating the need for a separate REST or GraphQL API layer.

•  Node.js Runtime — Server-side JavaScript execution environment.
•  Prisma ORM — Schema-first database access with type-safe query building and automated migration

management.

•  Supabase PostgreSQL — Managed relational database with row-level security policies enforcing per-

user data isolation.

•  Clerk SDK — Identity management supporting email, Google OAuth, and multi-factor authentication.

C. AI and ML Components

•  Gemini API (google/gemini-pro) — Generative AI model for natural-language insight generation,

spending analysis, and budget recommendations.

•  XGBoost Classifier — Gradient-boosted tree model for transaction categorization.
•  Prophet (Meta) — Decomposable time-series forecasting for monthly expenditure prediction.
•  Scikit-learn — Feature engineering and preprocessing pipeline management.

D. Key Feature Implementations

1. Automated Transaction Categorization

When a user submits a transaction, the system extracts the merchant name and amount, constructs a feature
vector,  and  queries  the  XGBoost  categorization  model  via  an  internal  API  route.  The  predicted  category  is
returned  within  200ms  and  pre-populated  in  the  transaction  form,  allowing  the  user  to  confirm  or  override.
Override events are logged and used to update user-specific category priors in a lightweight online learning loop.

2. AI Insight Generation

The  Insight  Engine  aggregates  the  user's  transactions  over  the  preceding  30  and  90  days,  computing  per-
category  spending  totals,  budget  utilization  rates,  and  anomaly  scores  (transactions  exceeding  2.5  standard
deviations from category-level means). These aggregates are serialized into a structured prompt template and
submitted to  the Gemini API.  The  model  returns insights  in  structured  JSON,  which  the frontend  renders  as
categorized alerts (warnings, tips, predictions, summaries).

3. Budget Alerting

Budget  thresholds are  stored per  user  per  category.  A  background  job  (Next.js  route  handler  triggered  by a
CRON schedule) computes current-month spending against configured budgets and generates alert records at
80% and 100% utilization. Alert cards are rendered in the dashboard with visual severity indicators and Gemini-
generated mitigation suggestions.

VII. Results and Discussion

A. System Performance

Fig. 5: XGBoost Transaction Categorisation F1-Scores

The  platform  was  evaluated  across  three  performance  dimensions:  categorization  accuracy,  system
responsiveness, and user experience quality.

The XGBoost categorization model achieves an overall weighted F1-score of 0.913 across eighteen spending
categories  on  a  held-out  test  set  of  4,200  transactions  drawn  from  anonymized  personal  finance  datasets.
Categories with high linguistic diversity (e.g., "Miscellaneous") show lower precision (0.81), while high-frequency
categories (Food & Dining, Transport, Utilities) achieve F1-scores above 0.95. These results are consistent with
the performance benchmarks reported by Kotios et al. (2022) for hybrid transaction classification systems.[10]

Server response times for standard dashboard loads average 420ms on a standard broadband connection, with
AI insight generation (Gemini API) adding an additional 800–1,400ms. The streaming architecture of Next.js 14
ensures  that  static  dashboard  elements  render  immediately  while  AI-generated  content  loads  progressively,
avoiding perceptible loading delays for core functionality.

B. User Interface and Experience

The  application  delivers  a  clean,  responsive  interface  optimized  for  both  desktop  and  mobile  devices.  The
dashboard presents the user's total expenses for the selected period via a dynamic widget, alongside category-
wise pie charts, monthly trend bar charts, and a recent transactions table. All visualizations are rendered using
Recharts with smooth animations and interactive tooltips.

The  AI  Insights  panel  presents  Gemini-generated  observations  in  four  structured  card  categories:  spending
warnings  (e.g.,  "Your  Food  &  Dining  spending  increased  by  23%  this  month  compared  to  your  3-month
average"), budget tips, expense predictions, and monthly summaries. User feedback collected during pilot testing
indicated  that  84%  of  participants  found  the  AI-generated  insights  either  "useful"  or  "very  useful"  for  guiding
financial decisions.

C. Comparison with Related Systems

Compared with the Budget Buddy system (IJARCCE, 2025)[8], Spend AI extends capabilities with time-series
forecasting, anomaly-based alerts, and a structured multi-category insight taxonomy. Relative to the personal
finance tracker described by Verma et al. (2024)[1], the present system adds a complete AI pipeline, reducing
manual categorization effort by approximately 78% in pilot user trials. The multi-agent AI architecture proposed
by  Pancholi  et  al.  (2026)[13]  represents  a  more  complex  system  but  targets  a  different  deployment  context
(investment advisory), whereas Spend AI focuses on the day-to-day expense management needs of individual
users.

VIII. Advantages and Limitations

A. Advantages

•  Unified AI pipeline combining ML categorization, LLM insights, and time-series forecasting in a single

deployable application.

•  Production-grade security: row-level database security, server-side business logic, and enterprise

identity management via Clerk.

•  High performance frontend: Next.js 14 App Router enables sub-500ms dashboard loads for core UI

elements.

•  Personalization: category prior adaptation and user-specific forecasting improve accuracy over time.
•  Cross-platform accessibility: responsive design supports desktop, tablet, and mobile users without

platform-specific applications.

•  Extensible architecture: modular layer separation enables independent scaling of frontend, AI, and data

components.

B. Limitations

•  Cold-start problem: categorization accuracy is lower for new users with fewer than 50 historical

transactions, a challenge common to personalized ML systems.

•  LLM hallucination risk: while RAG-style prompting mitigates factual errors, the Gemini API may

occasionally generate imprecise financial guidance; critical recommendations should be verified.
•  Manual data entry dependency: in the absence of direct banking API integration, some users may not

maintain complete transaction records.

•  Privacy considerations: financial data is highly sensitive; while Supabase RLS provides strong technical
controls, data residency and regulatory compliance (e.g., DPDP Act, India) require further attention.

•  Forecasting accuracy: time-series models require at least 3 months of historical data for reliable

predictions; shorter histories produce wider, less actionable confidence intervals.

IX. Future Scope

Several directions for future development are identified:

•  Banking API Integration: Integration with Open Banking APIs (e.g., Razorpay, Plaid, or NPCI's Account
Aggregator framework) to enable automatic, real-time transaction synchronization, eliminating manual
entry.

•  OCR Receipt Scanning: Extension of the data ingestion pipeline with a document intelligence module to
extract transaction details from uploaded receipt images, leveraging multimodal LLM capabilities now
emerging in Gemini.
Investment Tracking: Expansion of the platform to track mutual fund SIPs, equity holdings, and fixed
deposits, enabling holistic net-worth management alongside expense tracking.

•

•  Multi-User Shared Budgets: Support for collaborative expense management across families,
roommates, or project teams, enabling shared category budgets and split-expense tracking.

•  Explainable AI (XAI) Dashboard: Integration of SHAP-based explanations for categorization predictions,

enabling users to understand and audit the model's reasoning—addressing the transparency concerns
identified in the literature.

•  Voice Interface: Development of a conversational voice assistant interface for expense logging and

financial queries, leveraging Gemini's multimodal API.

X. Conclusion

This  paper  presented  Spend  AI,  a  Next.js-powered  AI  platform  for  smart  expense  tracking,  budgeting,  and
financial  insights.  The  system  addresses  critical  limitations  in  existing  personal finance tools by  integrating a
supervised  ML  categorization  engine,  a  Gemini  LLM-driven  insight  module,  and  a  time-series  forecasting
component within a production-grade full-stack web architecture.

Experimental  evaluation  demonstrates  that  the  platform  achieves  91.3%  weighted  F1-score  for  transaction
categorization,  generates  meaningful  and  user-validated  financial  insights,  and  reduces  manual  financial
management effort substantially compared to traditional approaches. The modular, layered architecture ensures
scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns between AI, data, and presentation components.

The work contributes an open architecture and methodology for the development of consumer-grade AI financial
management systems, grounded in current best practices from the machine  learning, LLM, and full-stack web
development literature. Future work will focus on banking API integration, expanded investment tracking, and
the incorporation of explainable AI mechanisms to improve user trust and regulatory alignment.

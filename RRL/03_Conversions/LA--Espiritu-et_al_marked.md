Abstract: This study presents a unique and innovative approach to improving the management of
scholarship programs through the integration of data  mining techniques and online systems. The
BRO-Ed Scholarship program in Isabela province is facing the challenge of efficiently handling a
growing number of scholarship applications. This study involves leveraging data mining to simplify
this  process,  address  operational  challenges,  and  contribute  to  the  transformation  of  the  lives  of
underprivileged  students.  Data  mining  techniques  that  include  systematic  data  integration,
preprocessing, decision tree implementation, and clustering algorithms were utilized in this study.
Additionally, we have created a user-friendly online platform to enhance accessibility. Initial results
show a significant increase in the success rate, indicating the potential of managing scholarships
using data-driven approaches. The expected outcomes include a  streamlined application process,
informed decisions based on data-driven analysis, and optimized budget allocation. By establishing
a  model  for  innovative  advancement  in  scholarship  programs,  this  project  aims  to  promote
educational support initiatives for underprivileged students aligned with the government’s mandate
for  Sustainable  Development  Goal  4,  addressing  inclusivity  and  growing  inequality  among
marginalized people and communities.

INTRODUCTION

Despite consistent progress toward education, COVID-19 caused learning deficits in four out of five of the
104 nations studied. Seventy-nine low- and lower-middle-income nations face a $97 billion yearly funding shortfall
to meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 requirements, notwithstanding decreased goals. Educational finance must
be  a  national  investment  priority.  Free  and  mandatory  education,  teacher  recruitment,  school  infrastructure
improvements, and digital transformation are crucial (United Nations, 2023).

The  BRO-Ed  scholarship  program,  as  highlighted  on  the  official  website  of  Isabela  province
(https://provinceofisabela.ph/),  is  not  just  a  program  but  a  beacon  of  hope  and  a  lifeline  that  provides  valuable
assistance  to  deserving  individuals.  Its  significance  in  expanding  educational  opportunities,  especially  for
economically  disadvantaged  students,  cannot  be  overstated.  However,  like  many  similar  programs,  BRO-Ed  is
grappling with the challenge of managing a surge in scholarship applications. This opening paragraph underscores the
BRO-Ed Scholarship Program's paramount importance in the province's educational landscape and the pressing need
for innovative solutions to its operational challenges.

The BRO-Ed Scholarship program, dedicated to expanding education access among disadvantaged children,
stands at a critical junction characterized by serious impediments requiring strategic and innovative responses (Yağcı,

2022). One is the lack of a systematic way of evaluating the growing number of scholarship applications (Alyahyan
& Düştegör, 2020). Consequentially, there is an immediate need for change brought about by this subjective and time-
consuming manual review process (Yağcı, 2022).

The increasing number of students who require help learning and inefficiency in the prevailing application
reviewing process is now more evident than ever (Ferreira-Mello et al., 2019). Moreover, dealing with many forms
manually and assessing them one by one not only slows down the program but also increases the chances of missing
crucial features that contribute to the success of a scholarship (Sugiyarti et al., 2018). Consequently, these are serious
impediments  that  necessitate  incorporating  new  analytical  procedures,  such  as  data  mining,  in  the  BRO-Ed
Scholarship program (Delima, 2019).

Quantifying the Surge

Isabela province government’s BRO Ed Scholarship program leads the way in providing education for people
in need. The BRO-Ed Scholarship fund has experienced a  five-year high of 541.1%  in the number of applications
received. In the past, the program could only handle 5,368 applications per annum, while currently, this number is an
unbelievable 34,426 applications for each cycle. This upswing not only emphasizes its growing importance but also
demonstrates that there is an urgent need to strengthen the application process to cope with this massive influx. Its
mission is laudable; however, its application responses’ analysis presents challenges that lack a systematic approach
to deriving actionable insights from applications’ bulk data.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Over time, the pervasiveness of data mining techniques in various fields has been met with rising scholarly
interest in applying them to educational contexts, especially scholarship programs. Scholarship programs in education,
mining, and related fields have valuable scholarly papers that provide  essential information on predictive models,
algorithms  of  machine  learning,  and  ethical  concerns.  Yağcı  et  al.  (2022)  discuss  predicting  students'  academic
performance using machine learning algorithms; they will shed light on potential uses within scholarship programs.
Alyahyan and Düştegör (2020) offer a literature review and best practices for predicting academic success in higher
education to form a basis for scholarship program predictive modeling. eMineProve was introduced by Rosado et al.
(2019),  an  educational  data  mining  tool  for  predicting  performance  improvement  that  displays  the  practical
implications of data mining in education.

Furthermore, Kurniadi et al. (2018) investigate the prediction of scholarship recipients using the k-Nearest
Neighbor algorithm, giving us insights into algorithmic approaches to scholarship selection processes. Ferreira-Mello
et  al.  (2019)  elaborate  on  text  mining  in  education;  this  emphasizes  the  potential  benefit  of  textual  analysis  in
improving  scholarship  program  administration.  Sugiyarti  et  al.  (2018)  present  a  decision  support  system  for
scholarship  grantees’  selection  based  on  data  mining  techniques,  demonstrating  the  integration  of  data-driven
approaches into scholarship administration. The literary work also examines ethical issues, with Carmine Ferrara et
al.  (2023)  examining  fairness-aware  machine  learning  engineering  and  Olajide  O.  Agunloye  (2019)  revealing  the
principles and applications of ethics in academic research and scholarship. Moreover, Marcelo Almeida Santana et al.
(2017) assess the efficiency of educational data mining methods for predicting students’ academic failure early and
give insight into practical implications for predictive modeling in education environments.

In order to build on the existing body of knowledge, this project seeks to apply data mining techniques to the
BRO  Ed  Scholarship  program.  Given  the  identified  literature  deficiencies,  it  is  essential  to  carry  out  customized
educational data mining in scholarship programs for disadvantaged learners due to the pressingness and significance
of this mission. The rest of the literature forms a base, but the BRO Ed Scholarship has its peculiarities that will require
drilling down further about data mining approaches.

The present literature survey shows an increased acceptance of data mining in educational decision-making.
Despite some gains in understanding how they can be applied, there is a  considerable gap in the available review
literature  regarding  the  specific  difficulties  that  scholarship  programs  grapple  with,  particularly  those  meant  for
underprivileged students, such as the BRO Ed Scholarship program. The lack of a systematic approach in these studies
highlights the importance of our project, which is aimed at bridging this gap by adopting data mining tools to simplify
the scholarship application process and improve decision-making. This reinforces our project's justification, making
it a focused and innovative solution to address some of these unique problems documented within the literature.

METHODOLOGY

Our  methodology  involves  a  systematic  approach  to  implementing  data  mining  techniques  and  online
systems,  as  illustrated  in33.  We  will  begin  by  incorporating  historical  scholarship  application  information  before
conducting exhaustive pre-processing and cleaning. Then, a user-friendly online registration platform will be easy to
access. Data mining algorithms such as clustering and decision trees will be used for pattern recognition.

The use of decision trees and clustering algorithms was based on some criteria. Decision trees suit our goal
of identifying the most  critical variables  determining scholarship application success. They provide clear decision
rules that can be interpreted easily, making it easier to understand the underlying patterns in the data set. Moreover,
they can handle both numerical and categorical data, thus being versatile with the heterogeneous dataset we have at
hand.

However, clustering algorithms reveal underlying structures or groups within the scholarship application data
in  a  different  sense.  Clustering,  for  example,  allows  us  to  group  similar  applications  and  determine  common
characteristics among successful applicants that may not be immediately obvious. Such information can be  helpful
when it comes to refining our knowledge of factors influencing application success and supporting decision-making
processes.

Decision trees and clustering are also commonly used techniques in data mining, and comprehensive support
and documentation are available. They are robust and scalable, which is relevant when dealing with large quantities
of scholarship application data.

In  general,  the  use  of  decision  trees  and  clustering  algorithms  is  consistent  with  our  aim  of  finding  key

variables, identifying trends, and optimizing the efficiency of the scholarship program.

strategies.

•  Outlier Detection and Treatment: Using statistical methods to detect and handle outliers.
•

Standardization  and  Normalization:  This  implies  that  numerical  features  are  standardized,  while  the
values of all variables in a given dataset are changed to fall within a specified range.

•  Encoding  Categorical  Variables:  In  this  regard,  categorical  variables  are  transformed  into  numerical

equivalents using appropriate encoding techniques.

•  Addressing  Duplicate  Entries:  This  includes  identifying  and  dealing  with  duplicate  entries  to  avoid

repetition.

•
Integration  Component:  Incorporating  the  historical  scholarship  data  into  the  website  for  real-time
feedback.

4.  Data Mining Implementation

•  Algorithms: Decision trees and clustering algorithms have been chosen for pattern recognition.

Decision  Tree  Algorithm:  To  handle  categorical  and  numerical  data  effectively,  we  used  the  C4.5
algorithm, a well-known decision tree algorithm.

C4.5(dataset, target_variable)

If all instances in the dataset have the same target_variable value, return a leaf node with that value.

If the dataset is empty, return a leaf node with no value
Calculate the information gain and information gain ratio for each attribute in the dataset
Choose the attribute with the highest information gain ratio as the split attribute
Create a node for the split attribute
Recursively  apply  the  C4.5  algorithm  to  each  subset  of  the  dataset  created  by  the  split
attribute.

Return the decision tree.

Clustering Algorithm: The K-means clustering algorithm was the best choice because it is simple and
efficient in dividing a dataset into groups with similar properties.

KMeans(dataset, K)

Initialize K cluster centroids randomly

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
Update the centroids by calculating the mean of all data points in each cluster.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number
of iterations is reached.

Return the final cluster assignments.

•  Continuous Improvement: Based on client feedback, it will increase its features and refine its mining

processes.

•  Data Mining Fine-Tuning: Improving algorithms used to identify patterns.

8.  Deployment
•
•  Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor a system's effectiveness after launching it.

Launch: Make the system available for other users.

9.  Measuring Effectiveness

•  Quantitative Evaluation: Measuring the algorithm’s accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score…
Where:

TP (True Positives) - Number of correctly classified positive instances.
TN (True Negatives) - Number of correctly classified negative instances.
FP (False Positives) - Number of negative instances incorrectly classified as positive.
FN (False Negatives) - Number of positive instances incorrectly classified as unfavorable.

Accuracy: This criterion calculates a percentage of correctly labeled objects. In other words, it represents the
number of true positives and negatives divided by the total number.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision indicates the number of true positives among all items marked as such by the algorithm.  When
applied to imbalanced datasets or those with costly false positives, it is precious.

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall: Synonymous with sensitivity, this parameter denotes  the share of true positives  about all positive
objects  in  the  dataset.  It  is  more  valuable  than  any  other  metric  for  situations  where  false  negatives  are
expensive.

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

F1-score: This measure is essential because it simultaneously considers precision and recall when evaluating
performance on complex models.

F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

•  Qualitative Evaluation: Comparing findings with manual review to assess usefulness.

Ethical Considerations

Implementing data mining techniques and handling historical scholarship application data  requires a solid
commitment  to  ethical  standards,  especially  regarding  data  utilization  and  privacy.  Some  vital  factors  must  be
considered to ensure that sensitive information is handled responsibly and respectfully.

1.  Data  Anonymization:  All  personally  identifiable  information  (PII)  within  the  historical  scholarship
application data will be carefully anonymized so that individual applicants cannot be identified. This is
necessary to protect applicants’ confidentiality and comply with ethical practices when dealing with data.
Informed  Consent:  Efforts  will  be  made  towards  seeking  retrospective  informed  consent  whenever
possible, considering the sensitivity of the data. Even though historical data often falls outside current
consent norms, our ethics entail recognizing individuals’ rights even in historical contexts.

2.

3.  Data Security Measures: The integrity and confidentiality of the scholarship application data will also
be protected by implementing solid security measures. Some access controls and encryption protocols
may be employed to prevent unauthorized accessibility or loss of scholarship application content.
4.  Transparent  Communication:  We  will  also  ensure  that  our  communication  is  transparent  during  the
project.  This  involves  giving  stakeholders  such  as  scholarship  applicants  and  relevant  authorities
information on why the data mining techniques were used, how they were applied, and the  expected
results. Consequently, this promotes trust and accountability among the involved parties.

5.  Alignment  with  Regulations:  It  will  also  faithfully  comply  with  local  and  international  standards
regarding data privacy. For example, adherence to the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10173)
confirms that data handling practices are consistent with legal provisions, thus solidifying the ethical
foundation of this project (National Privacy Commission, 2022).

6.  Continuous  Monitoring and Evaluation:  We  should  consistently  evaluate  data  management  practices
against these ethical principles. Periodic assessments will ensure that ethical considerations are met from
the project's inception to its conclusion.

To achieve that aim, we have included in our methodology these ethical considerations regarding respect for
individuals’ privacy and upholding high moral standards about using and analyzing information available in datasets.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The data preprocessing stage was a project phase that included detailed input data collection and cleaning.
This  included  implementing  a  range  of  techniques  for  handling  missing  values,  detecting  and  treating  outliers,
standardizing and normalizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and dealing with duplicate entries
to maintain the quality and integrity of the data. This holistic approach ensured a robust analysis dataset was obtained
without discrepancies with subsequent mining processes.

Table 2 reveals the following:
•  Completeness: 5% of cases are considered missing values in this dataset.
•  Accuracy: 95% is this set's accuracy level for correct cases.
•  Unambiguity:  The  information  format  throughout  all  records  is  similar,  indicating  high  consistency

levels in this series.

These variables were identified through pre-processing and analysis of past scholarship application data that
influenced the results of scholarships. Academic performance, socioeconomic background, extra-curricular activities,
and demographic information emerged as critical predictors of successful applications. By meticulously preprocessing
the data  and conducting  a thorough analysis, valuable insights into what makes a scholarship applicant successful
were obtained, leading to more informed decision-making processes.

Key emphasis must be placed on the online registration system implemented by our study findings. This was
achieved through a well-considered technological framework that contained Handlebars.js in the front end, Node.js
and Express.js in the back end, MySQL for database management, and W3.CSS framework for user interface design.
These technology choices were crucial in accomplishing our primary goals because they played an essential role in
enhancing  accessibility  and  user  satisfaction  and  influencing  some  crucial  factors  toward  success  in  scholarship
applications.

Detailed Technical Justification

Handlebars.js (Front-End Framework):

•  Reasoning: We chose handlebars.js because of its simplicity and speed in transforming dynamic
content. A logical-less template mechanism was best for the light, flexible front end we needed for
this project. It is modular, and hence, with a bit of change here and there, it can easily integrate
dynamic data into the user interface.

Node.js (Back-End Framework):

•  Reasoning: Node.js seemed like a natural fit because of its non-blocking event-driven architecture.
This was essential since several connections were made concurrently during the online registration
exercise. Moreover, the Node package manager provides an extensive NPM ecosystem of libraries,
which reduces the integration overheads of different functionalities.

Express.js (Back-End Framework):

•  Reasoning: Express.js provided a minimalist web application framework that could work well with
Node.js. Middleware-based architecture allowed the creation of robust restful APIs that connect the

front  end  and  the  database  back  end.  The  development  process  was  done  rapidly  without
compromising functionality due to express’ simplicity.

MySQL (Database Management):

•  Reasoning:  Reliability,  scalability,  and  MySQL's  reputation  for  handling  relational  data  were
among the factors that led to the choice of MySQL as a database management system. Scholarship
application data is structured and can easily fit into a relational database model, while MySQL’s
support for ACID properties ensures data integrity.

W3.CSS (User et al.):

•  Reasoning: W3.CSS's lightweightness and responsive design abilities made it an ideal choice. A
grid  system  and  pre-built  components  facilitated  the  creation  of  an  attractive  and  user-friendly
interface. This decision to incorporate W3.CSS was consistent with the project's focus on a more
accessible yet responsive online platform.

The highly advanced technology used to develop this online registration platform reveals a commitment to

Our  models  achieved  remarkable  success  rates  of  80%  based  on  predictive  accuracy  from  algorithms,
outperforming the failure prediction rate of 70%, which tested their worthiness in projecting outcomes of scholarship
applications as illustrated in Figure 5.

On the same line, Figure 6 shows how effectively these factors capture all actual successful applicants and

correctly identify successful applicants, among other things influencing scholarship applications.

As  shown  in  Figure  7,  a  comparative  analysis  between  the  F1-score  and  category  indicates  that  these
categories form balanced measures for algorithm performance and prove their ability to predict scholarship application
outcomes.

In this paper, Mustafa Yağcı et al. (2022)  discuss using machine learning algorithms to predict students’
academic performance, setting the tone for predictive modeling in scholarship programs. Thus, their study gives us
directions on applying data mining techniques to identify critical variables affecting scholarship application results.

A literature review may help predict success in university education; Eyman Alyahyan and Dilek Düştegör
(2020) provide this. They further our knowledge about what influences success rates when getting a grant and teach
us which factors are most relevant for analysis.

On text mining in education, Rafael Ferreira-Mello et al. (2019) give the usefulness of textual analytics in
enhancing the management of scholarships. In light of that, their discussion about text mining serves as a basis for
handling information from text related to applying for scholarships.

Eka Sugiyarti et al.’s work, Decision Support System for Scholarship Grantee Selection Using Data Mining
Techniques  (2018),  is  an  example  of  such  integrative  applications  where  data-driven  approaches  are  practically
embedded  into  scholarship  administration.  Therefore,  they provide  a  framework  for  using  data  mining  algorithms
while selecting resources wisely.

Using these studies and integrating what we learn into our research framework, we substantiate our study on
theoretical grounds, conforming to the standards set in scholarship program management and data-driven decision-
making.

Introducing  an  online  registration  system  facilitated  by  a  robust  technological  framework  has  not  only
resolved the challenges in the literature but also surpassed industry and academic benchmarks. The statistical successes
and improvements show actual benefits in using data solutions, which has positioned the BRO Ed Scholarship program
at the cutting edge of innovative educational support initiatives.

The  use  of  advanced  data  mining  techniques  is  one  of  the  key  theoretical  contributions  of  our  study  in
scholarship program management. We want to make more informed decisions and allocate resources more efficiently
using machine learning algorithms like decision trees and clustering, which would reveal hidden patterns and insights

within the data about scholarship applications. Also, this idea is new because it integrates these methods into online
systems to minimize the costs involved in processing massive amounts of information on applicants, thus making it
easy to apply and maximize performance.

On top of that, we expect that combining such data mining techniques with an online system framework will
open up opportunities for streamlining the application process  and making it more accessible and scalable without
trading off performance.

Integrating data mining methods with internet-based systems proposed here has far-reaching implications for
scholarship  program  management  and  educational  access.  The  current  study  focuses  on  bettering  the  procedures
through which scholarships are  sought.  This implies that  scholarship programs can address immediate  operational
challenges  using  subjective  factors  and  manual  review  processes.  Furthermore,  our  approach  helps  serve  broader
objectives  for  promoting  educational  equity  and  accessibility  among disadvantaged  students  by  uncovering  subtle
determinants of successful applications or financing optimization.

Therefore, this study is meant to revolutionize  scholarship program management through the “Improving
Scholarship  Programs  through  Data  Mining  and  Online  Systems”  project.  The  findings  thus  lay  a  foundation  for
applying data mining in the scholarship application process and using online systems that will improve the efficiency,
fairness, and accessibility of scholarships in the future. Finally, there is a need for further research and implementation
to tap fully into the potential of this new way of thinking and its grounding contribution to the scholarship process.

CONCLUSION

This  study  constitutes  a  significant  leap  forward  in  advancing  scholarship  program  management  by
integrating data mining techniques with online systems. Correspondingly, our research has significantly contributed
to scholarship program management since it addressed some issues the BRO Ed Scholarship faces.

Our study, firstly, introduces an innovative method of managing scholarship programs through advanced data
mining. We use decision trees and clustering algorithms, as well as other tools, to expose hidden patterns and insights
in the application data, thereby allowing us to understand better the factors affecting success. This not only improves
the fairness and effectiveness of selection but also increases efficiency by optimizing the allocation of resources and
maximizing the program's effect on needy students.

Secondly, integrating these techniques into an online system framework represents a significant breakthrough
in  making  scholarships  more  accessible  and  scalable.  A  user-friendly  online  registration  platform  will  increase
accessibility  for  applicants  from  remote  areas  or  coastal  municipalities  in  Isabela  province.  Moreover,  real-time
interaction  features  within  the  online  system  streamline  the  application  process  and  increase  user  satisfaction  and
success rates.

Lastly,  our  study  underlines  the  significance  of  embracing  data-based  solutions  in  scholarship  program
management. In addition to aligning with established best practices and drawing from insights from previous literature,
this keeps our research at the forefront of innovative educational support initiatives. Therefore, our study's statistical
success rate improvements prove that data-driven decision-making is sound, making the BRO Ed Scholarship program
a possible model for other educational support initiatives.

Finally,  this  research  addresses  the  challenges  faced  by  the  BRO  Ed  Scholarship  program  and  enhances
scholarship  program  management  by  introducing  a  data-driven  approach  that  improves  effectiveness,  equity,  and
accessibility.  In  the  future,  information  gathered  from  this  research  will  continue  to  guide  scholarship  program
management  practices,  thus  contributing  to  broader  goals  of  promoting  equal  access  to  education  among
underprivileged learners.

Future Works

This project plans to involve more complicated integration and improving machine learning algorithms. For
instance, we will explore decision trees and clustering more deeply, focusing on refining their parameters to enhance
pattern  recognition  and  insight  extraction.  Moreover,  advanced  machine  learning  algorithms  will  be  explored  to
improve prediction accuracy regarding scholarship application success.

Furthermore, incorporating machine learning algorithms more intricately than ever would require continuous
refinement and optimization that ensures that models evolve with the changing landscape of scholarship applications.

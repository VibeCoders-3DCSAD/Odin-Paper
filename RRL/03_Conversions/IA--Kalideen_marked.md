Detection of Fraudulent Transaction Issues in
the Payment Card Industry using Machine
Learning: A Comprehensive Survey
M. R. Kalideen
Abstract The increasing prevalence of online payment card transactions has brought with it a surge in fraudulent activities, posing
significant challenges to the financial industry. This comprehensive survey examines the utilization of machine learning
methodologies to identify fraudulent transactions within the payment card industry. This review examines a diverse array of
machine learning algorithms, including advanced deep learning architectures such as Deep Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural
Networks, Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks. The strengths and limitations of these models in the context of
fraud detection challenges are thoroughly discussed. The review also analyzes key issues such as imbalanced datasets, model
interpretability, scalability, security concerns, and the importance of privacy preservation. Furthermore, we highlight emerging
trends such as explainable AI, privacy-preserving machine learning, including federated learning, and the potential of blockchain
technology for enhancing fraud detection systems. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for practitioners and identify
promising directions for future research, emphasizing the need for robust, scalable, and ethical AI solutions to combat evolving
fraudulent activities in the payment card industry. This research endeavor aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the most
recent advancements in machine learning-based methodologies for detecting fraudulent transactions, providing insights into the
strengths and limitations of diverse approaches in addressing the distinctive challenges encountered within the payment card
industry. This study serves as a valuable academic resource by examining emerging trends and future research directions, providing
insights that can aid academics, researchers, and industry professionals in developing more effective and ethical solutions to combat
the persistent threat of payment card fraud.

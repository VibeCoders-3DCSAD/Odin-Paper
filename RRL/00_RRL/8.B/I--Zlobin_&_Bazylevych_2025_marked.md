SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DEEP AND MACHINE LEARNING
FOR FINANCIAL MODELING

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have impacted financial analytics, with advanced solutions for classifi-
cation and regression tasks. This systematic review provides an analysis of state-of-the-art ML/DL applications in finance, with
focus on methods, but also challenges. A total of 41 papers were analysed to identify trends, methodologies, and research gaps
in this domain. The study begins with an overview of ML/DL in finance, main classification and regression problems, and
challenges in financial data modelling. It then explores ML/DL techniques for classification tasks such as credit scoring, fraud
detection, and algorithmic trading, evaluating traditional and modern approaches, including transformer-based models for
sentiment analysis. Regression-oriented applications are analysed, with focus on stock price prediction, volatility forecasting,
and portfolio optimization, with insights into hybrid modelling strategies. Comparative analysis assesses ML/DL models based
on performance metrics, interpretability, and trade-offs between accuracy, computational complexity, and generalizability. The
paper also identifies challenges, including data quality, ethical concerns, models, and the integration of ML/DL with traditional
financial frameworks. Trends such as explainable AI, federated learning, and quantum computing are discussed as future di-
rections. Findings show the increasing role of ML/DL in financial decision-making.

Key words: Deep learning; machine learning; classification problems; regression models; financial analytics.

Urgency of the research. Financial institutions are now dealing with datasets that traditional
analytical methods struggle to process effectively. ML and DL models analyse these large vol-
umes of data, but with improved predictive accuracy and more informed decision-making pro-
cesses. These technologies have found additional applications in different financial domains, in-
cluding credit scoring, fraud detection, and market forecasting [1; 2]. Practical significance of
this paper represents the impact of ML and DL on financial analytics. In credit scoring, DL models
have improved assessment of borrowers' creditworthiness by identifying complex patterns in fi-
nancial behaviours, thereby reducing default rates. In fraud detection, ML algorithms have im-
proved identification of fraudulent activities by analysing transaction patterns and anomalies. In
market forecasting, DL techniques have improved accuracy of predicting market trends, that in-
vestors have more informed decisions [3]. The urgency of this research is highlighted by the find-
ings in AI technologies and their potential to revolutionize financial services. Trends such as ex-
plainable AI, federated learning, and quantum computing are addressing current challenges in
financial modelling, including data privacy, model interpretability, and computational limitations.
Explainable AI aims to make ML models more transparent, in order to understand the decision-
making  process  in  regulated  industries  like  finance.  Federated  learning  enables  collaborative
model training across decentralized data sources, preserving data privacy, that is concern in fi-
nancial data management. Quantum computing is used for solving complex optimization prob-
lems in finance at high speed, transforming risk assessment and portfolio optimization.

Target setting. The research addresses the challenge of systematically reviewing and syn-
thesizing state-of-the-art ML and DL methods applied to classification and regression problems
within the financial sector. Financial institutions are increasingly adopting ML and DL tech-
niques to improve decision-making processes, risk assessment, and predictive analytics. How-
ever, the rapid evolution of these technologies presents a challenge to stay informed about the
most effective and current methodologies. This research aims to systemize existing knowledge,
evaluate the efficacy of different ML and DL models, and identify gaps in the current literature
to guide future research directions.

Actual scientific research and issues analysis. Several studies have attempted to address
the challenges associated with classification and regression tasks. A literature review analysed
the new findings  of ML and DL in  financial applications, highlighting their effectiveness  in
different financial tasks [4]. The paper analyzed the use of DL in economics, with insights into
frequently used models and their applications. This research offered a review of DL implemen-
tations in economic contexts, with both the potential and limitations of these technologies. In
business and finance, a review analyzed ML applications, with the focus on techniques used in
marketing, stock analysis, and demand forecasting. The paper also addressed limitations related
to data quality and model interpretability [5]. Furthermore, a literature review focused on fi-
nancial time series forecasting with DL, categorizing studies based on their forecasting imple-
mentation areas and model choices. This review highlighted the growing interest in DL models
for financial forecasting and identified potential research opportunities [6]. Despite these anal-
yses, challenges exist in the application of ML and DL in finance. Issues such as data imbalance,
model transparency, and the need for evaluation metrics remains. Addressing these challenges
is needed for the practical utility of ML and DL in financial contexts [7].

Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. Despite findings in applying ML and
DL to financial classification and regression tasks, some areas remain underexplored. One of
the  main  challenges  is  model  interpretability.  Many  ML  and  DL  models  operate  as  “black
boxes”, difficult to understand their decision-making processes. This lack of transparency re-
duces trust and slows adoption in financial institutions, where interpretability is used for regu-
latory  compliance  and  risk  management. Another  unresolved  issue  is  data  quality. Financial
datasets often contain noise, missing values, or imbalanced classes. This can introduce biases
in model training. But also access to high-quality, proprietary financial data is frequently re-
stricted. The problem of concept drift is still a major limitation in financial modelling. Market
conditions are dynamic, and statistical properties change over time. Models trained on historical
data may become outdated, that lead to reduced predictive accuracy.

The research objective. The objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review
of state-of-the-art ML and DL methods applied to classification and regression problems in the
financial sector. With analysing existing  literature, the paper aims to  identify current  trends,
evaluate the effectiveness of models, and uncover gaps in the application within finance. The
outcome of this research is a synthesis of existing studies that analyse the strengths and limita-
tions  of  ML  and  DL  approaches  in  financial  applications. This  includes  insights  into  model
performance, data requirements, and contextual applicability. The study also aims to provide
an assessment of challenges such as data quality, model interpretability. The paper serves as a
resource that highlights existing research gaps, thereby guiding future investigations into ML
and DL applications in finance.

Overview of ML and DL in finance. At first, financial institutions relied on traditional
statistical methods for tasks such as risk assessment and forecasting. However, ML introduced
more sophisticated algorithms capable of learning from data, that led to improved accuracy in
financial modelling. As an example, decision trees and support vector machines became popu-
lar for credit scoring and fraud detection [8; 9]. The progression from traditional ML to DL
marked a shift in financial analytics. DL models, specifically neural networks, have the capacity
to process amounts of unstructured data, such as text and images, used for complex financial
tasks. Applications of DL in finance include sentiment analysis of news articles for stock price
prediction and the development of risk assessment models [10-12]. In recent years, the finance
has adopted DL techniques, because of the increasing availability of big data and computational
power. This trend has led to the development of more accurate predictive models and automated
decision-making systems.

ML and DL have been used for addressing classification and regression problems in the
financial sector. The main classification problems that have been identified are credit scoring,
fraud detection, customer segmentation. ML algorithms, such as logistic regression are used in
assessments of credit reliability of loan applicants. The analysis of variables like credit history,
income, and employment status, these models predict the likelihood of default and helping fi-
nancial  institutions  in  making  informed  decisions. A  study  compared  ML  models,  including
neural networks and logistic regression, to predict the default status of credit card customers.
The results indicated that certain models achieved high accuracy in credit risk assessment [13].
The paper [14] presents the analysis of how ML is transforming digital credit scoring, specifi-
cally  in  rural  finance.  It  highlights  that  despite  findings  in  financial  sector,  a  portion  of  the
global rural population remains underserved by traditional banking systems. According to the
paper nearly one-third of the world's adult population lacks access to banking services, forcing
them to rely on informal or semi-formal credit sources. The paper emphasizes how ML algo-
rithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep learning models,
are being used by financial institutions to develop alternative credit scoring models, overcom-
ing the limitations of conventional scoring methods based on historical banking transactions.
The paper also analysis the challenges of the integration of ML models with traditional banking
systems, specifically regarding data availability, ethical concerns, and regulatory compliance.
The  paper  [15]  examines  the  accuracy  trade-off  in  ML  for  credit  scoring.  In  2020,  the  total
outstanding retail credit in the U.S. surpassed $4,161 billion, showing the economic importance
of fair and accurate credit scoring models. The paper highlights that traditional ML models tend
to optimize for profit without considering fairness, that lead to disparities in loan approvals in
different demographic groups. It provides a review of fairness criteria, including independence,
separation, and sufficiency, and assesses their suitability for credit scoring. Using 7 credit scor-
ing datasets, the paper compares improved fairness approaches such as pre-processing, in-pro-
cessing, and post-processing methods. The findings reveal that fair in-processing techniques
have a balance between reducing bias and maintaining profitability. The paper also shows that
reducing discrimination in credit scoring models can be achieved with minimal profit loss, ap-
proximately 4.91% when reducing fairness violations below a 0.2 separation metric threshold.
However, achieving perfect fairness would result in over a 35% drop in profitability that makes
it financially unfeasible for lenders.

DL have further improved credit scoring by identifying complex, non-linear relationships
in data. An example is the development of a DL model that outperformed standard credit scor-
ing models, even when using the same data. This model provided more accurate predictions
aimed at reducing consumer default [16]. The paper [17] presents evaluation of DL in credit
scoring, highlighting their advantages over traditional ML models. The paper analyses the com-
parison of the performance of DL architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs), convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders (AEs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) net-
works. The review presents the DL applications using commonly used credit scoring datasets,
including  the Australian,  German  (categorical  and  numerical),  Japanese,  and Taiwanese  da-
tasets, assessing model accuracy through metrics like area under the receiver operating charac-
teristic curve (AUC). The findings show that DBNs achieve higher accuracy than shallower
networks, as an alternative to traditional ML models for credit scoring. Financial institutions
are legally required, under regulations like the general data protection regulation and the Basel
accord,  to  explain  automated  credit  decisions  to  applicants. The  paper  [18]  proposes  a  new
framework that converts tabular credit scoring datasets into images, in order to enable the use
of 2D CNNs for classification while ensuring model interpretability. The research applies CNN
models on widely used credit datasets (German, Australian, and home equity line of credit da-
tasets) and shows that techniques such as Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP values, and Saliency Maps
can  provide  insights  into  DL  credit  decisions.  The  paper  empirically  validates  its  approach

186

ТЕХНІЧНІ НАУКИ ТА ТЕХНОЛОГІЇ

through performance comparisons, showing that 2D CNN models outperform 1D CNN models
while maintaining interpretability. Then, the SHAP values were identified as the most effective
explanation  method,  improving  classification  accuracy  to  99%  and  100%  in  test  cases,  and
show the practical applicability of explainable DL models in financial decision-making. Then,
the  analysis  that  should  be  included  in  the  review  of  DL  applications  in  credit  scoring  [19]
assesses  whether  DL  architectures,  specifically  multilayer  perceptron  (MLP)  networks,  and
DBNs,  outperform  conventional  credit  scoring  models  such  as  logistic  regression,  decision
trees, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Using 10 retail credit scoring
datasets,  the  paper  analyses  model  performance  based  on  4  metrics:  area  under  the  curve
(AUC), brier score (BS), partial Gini (PG), and expected maximum profit (EMP). The results
show that XGBoost consistently outperforms all other models, achieving the highest ranking
across all performance measures. However deep neural networks do not significantly outper-
form shallower ML models and are considerably more computationally expensive. The research
further explores  Bayesian statistical  testing methods  to  compare classifiers, showing the ad-
vantages of Bayesian over frequentist hypothesis testing in credit scoring research. The paper
concludes that DL is not the most suitable approach for credit scoring, and XGBoost should be
preferred for optimal classification performance due to its superior accuracy and efficiency

The  next  section  that  should  be  analyzed  is  that  ML  and  DL  models  are  used  to  detect
fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data. Techniques such
as logistic regression, random forests, and decision trees have been used for evaluation in iden-
tifying  fraudulent  credit  card  transactions  [1-3,8-9]. Among  these,  the  random  forest  model
showed good performance in predicting fraudulent activities [20]. The paper [21] highlights
that random forest when combined with  an ensemble feature selection technique integrating
recursive feature elimination, information gain, and chi-squared (χ²) methods, improves fraud
detection accuracy. The receiver operating characteristic score of 95.83% indicates the model's
strong capability to distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Furthermore, the
random forest model achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, with an F1-score of 99.6% and precision
of 100%, showing that fraudulent transactions are correctly identified with minimal false posi-
tives. The research shows that the ability of the random forest to construct several decision trees
and aggregate their results improves the model's generalization and resistance to overfitting.
The  ensemble  feature  selection  approach  also  reduces  training  time  while  maintaining  high
model  performance,  making  it  highly  efficient  for  real-time  fraud  detection. The  paper  [22]
highlights that credit card fraud detection is a challenge due to the highly imbalanced nature of
fraud datasets, where fraudulent transactions constitute a very small percentage of the total data.
To address this issue, the study employs the synthetic minority over-sampling technique to bal-
ance the dataset. In this way, it improves the ability of the random forest model to detect fraud-
ulent transactions accurately. The proposed model uses entropy as the guiding criterion for de-
cision  tree  construction.  It  also  provides  optimal  splits  and  reduces  impurity  in  data
classification. The model is trained on 1.3 million rows of training data and 550,000 rows of
test data, representing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The research evaluates model
performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, false negative rate, and false positive
rate to assess its effectiveness. The results show that the random forest model achieves a high
accuracy of 99.9% and reduces the number of undetected fraudulent transactions.

DL can process large data and provide good results in fraud detection. A systematic literature
review highlighted the effectiveness of different DL models, such as CNN and LSTM networks, in
detecting fraud across domains like credit card transactions and insurance claims [10]. These mod-
els have improved accuracy [3,23]. The CNN model is tested in the paper [24] on three benchmark
credit card fraud datasets (European, Australian, and German datasets). The evaluation metrics used
include the Matthews correlation coefficient, AUC, and cost of failure. The CNN model achieves
an AUC of 87.64% on the European dataset and 70.56% on the German dataset, showing that can

distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Furthermore, the CNN-based fraud detec-
tion model reduces the cost of failure, achieving a reduction of nearly 30% compared to traditional
models. The finding of the paper [24] is that CNN outperforms traditional fraud detection methods,
including random forest and SVM, by a margin of 5-10% in AUC scores. The CNN model is also
found to be more resilient to imbalanced datasets, a common challenge in fraud detection, where
fraudulent transactions account for less than 1% of total transactions. Then, the paper [25] addresses
challenges in electricity theft detection including data imbalance, the curse of dimensionality, and
the need for accurate classification. The proposed hybrid model integrates CNN for feature extrac-
tion and AdaBoost for classification. The model was trained and evaluated on the State Grid Cor-
poration of China dataset, which contains 42,372 observations, including 3,579 fraudulent user rec-
ords.  The  dataset  was  pre-processed  using  techniques  like  synthetic  minority  over-sampling
technique to mitigate the data imbalance issue. Experimental results show that the CNN-AdaBoost
model achieves a classification accuracy of 96.35%, outperforming traditional machine learning
models such as logistic regression (84.05%), decision trees (90.05%), random forest (90.98%), and
support vector machines (90.88%). The model also reduces the root mean square error to 0.2880
and achieves an F1-score of 95.60. Compared to standalone CNN and AdaBoost models, the hybrid
approach improves fraud detection accuracy. The significant finding is in the paper [26] of graph
convolutional  networks  (GCN)  in  detecting  fraudulent  activities  and  insider  threats. The  paper
shows that traditional fraud detection models primarily rely on individual user properties and over-
look structural relationships between users, which limits their accuracy in identifying coordinated
fraudulent behaviors. GCN models overcome this limitation by transforming user behaviors and
relationships into a graph-based structure, and the model learns both node-level (individual user)
and edge-level (inter-user relationship) features. Unlike CNNs, which are effective for structured
Euclidean data such as images, GCNs are designed to handle non-Euclidean data, ideal for fraud
detection in complex networks. The paper analyses the GCN model using a real insider threat da-
taset (CMU CERT v4.2), which consists of 1,000 users and their digital activities over 16 months.
The dataset includes event logs, such as email communication, logins, file transfers, and web activ-
ity, which are converted into graph representations. The research introduces a weighted adjacency
matrix function that quantifies not only direct user connections but also behavioral similarities, im-
proving the detection of fraudulent patterns. Experimental results show that GCN achieves a fraud
detection accuracy of 94.5%, outperforming CNN (93%), random forest (85%), logistic regression
(82%), and support vector machines (84%). Additionally, the recall rate of GCN is 83.3%, com-
pared to an average recall of 70% for traditional models, meaning GCN reduces the number of
undetected fraudulent activities.

Financial institutions employ clustering techniques to segment customers based on their
behaviors and preferences, this is  done in  order to  get  personalized marketing strategies. AI
personalization has been shown to build trust in digital finance with services that align with
individual customer needs [27,28]. The paper [28] shows how collaborative filtering, content-
based filtering, and hybrid recommendation models improve the accuracy of AI financial sug-
gestions. The study evaluates AI in increasing user engagement, financial decision-making, and
marketing strategies for financial institutions. Experimental results show that AI personalized
payment  recommendations  increase  user  engagement  by  27%  compared  to  traditional,  non-
personalized recommendations. Additionally, fintech companies implementing AI personaliza-
tion experience a 15% rise in customer retention rates and a 20% boost in conversion rates for
financial products and services. An innovative approach was shown in the paper [29] where the
evaluation of MyFinanceAI was presented. MyFinanceAI is an AI personal finance platform.
The paper highlights how AI financial tools improve savings, but also financial literacy, and
user engagement. It also addresses the growing complexity of modern financial management.
MyFinanceAI system integrates DNNs and reinforcement learning to provide personalized fi-
nancial recommendations based on real transaction data, spending habits, and financial goals.

A 6-month pilot study involving 1,000 users showed that 85% of users reported reduced finan-
cial stress, with a 43% decrease in financial anxiety scale scores. Additionally, monthly savings
increased by 22%, translating to an average additional savings of $317 per user per month. The
system’s automated bill management feature also resulted in 92% of users avoiding late fees,
leading to an average saving of $185 per user over the study period. The predictive budgeting
module uses autoregressive integrated moving average and LSTM models, improving expense
forecasting  accuracy  by  30%  compared  to  traditional  regression  models.  The  findings  also
showed the impact  of AI financial literacy tools,  which resulted in  a 40% increase in  users’
financial literacy scores over the study period. And the paper [30] highlights that chatbots and
virtual assistants are offering customized financial recommendations, and automated support.
The findings are that AI financial advisory systems analyze customer spending habits, invest-
ment preferences, and financial goals to deliver customized financial advice. Financial institu-
tions that implement this personalization report a 20% increase in customer engagement and a
15% rise in customer retention rates, showing improved user experiences. The paper also high-
lights that AI chatbots and virtual assistants in finance reduce customer wait times by up to 35%
and improve service accessibility. Additionally, AI models use natural language processing to
improve  financial  security  and  fraud  detection. AI  chatbots  assist  in  transactions,  and  fund
transfers, leading to an 18% improvement in customer response times and a 25% reduction in
operational costs for banks. These findings were analyzed and presented in Table 1.

forecasting stock prices is needed in order to plan investment strategies. Regression models, both
traditional and advanced, are used to analyze historical price and market indicators [31,32]. This
approach presents a linear relationship between a stock's past performance and its future prices.
With historical data, linear regression models can provide baseline predictions, though they may
oversimplify complex market dynamics. The paper [31] analyses the linear regression in stock
price prediction. The model is used to predict stock prices based on historical data, market indi-
cators, macroeconomic factors, and sentiment analysis. In stock market forecasting, linear regres-
sion works by identifying trends and making predictions based on a line of best fit, minimizing
the difference between actual and predicted values. The paper highlights that linear regression
models have been effectively applied in predicting the closing stock prices of major companies.
The research by Pahwa and Agarwal [33] showed the application of linear regression in forecast-
ing the Google stock price using 14 years of historical data. The analyses found that linear regres-
sion provided high confidence values in trend forecasting, which is suitable for short-term stock
price prediction. Another paper [34] further improved linear regression accuracy by incorporating
principal component analysis (PCA) to select the most relevant financial indicators. The results
showed that PCA linear regression models were more accurate than standalone models and even
outperformed SVM in specific structured datasets. Techniques, such as LSTM networks, a type
of recurrent neural network, have shown good capabilities in capturing temporal dependencies in
stock price data. The paper [32] analyses LSTM to the Vietnamese stock market which achieved
a 93% accuracy in predicting stock price trends, underscoring the model's effectiveness in han-
dling sequential financial data. Combining traditional financial theories with machine learning
models improves prediction accuracy. An example is integrating the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices in frontier markets [35]. The
paper [36]presents option pricing with ANNs and the traditional Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
model. It presents the introduction of a hybrid option pricing model (BS-ANN) and the compar-
ative  analysis  of  option  pricing  models,  including  Monte  Carlo  simulation,  Heston,  GARCH,
Jump diffusion, and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models. One of the findings is that the BS-ANN model
outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and stability. The paper analyzed the daily
stock price data of Khodro, an automobile company, over the past year. The results showed that
the BS-ANN model achieved the lowest standard deviation among all tested models, indicating
higher precision in predicting European call and put option prices. Compared to standard Black-
Scholes pricing, the hybrid ANN model reduced pricing errors and presented a more reliable al-
ternative for real option pricing applications. The paper [37] examined the KOSPI200 options
market using historical data from January to December 2023. The findings revealed that tradi-
tional models like the Black-Scholes and binomial tree model outperformed other methods in
terms of accuracy. RMSE analysis demonstrated that Black-Scholes and the binomial tree method
had the lowest prediction errors across all timeframes (weekly, monthly, and 50-day maturity).
The Monte Carlo and variance reduction methods showed  comparable performance, but  their
computational demands made them less practical for real-time trading. In contrast, ML models,
particularly random forest and XGBoost, were less accurate in predicting option prices but ex-
celled  in  identifying  undervalued  options.  The  investment  simulation  results  highlighted  that
XGBoost and random forest achieved the highest profitability, showing that ML models could be
useful for trading strategies focused on mispriced options. Significant results showed that Black-
Scholes and the binomial tree had the lowest errors across all timeframes, 0.650 for weekly pre-
dictions, 0.641 for monthly, and 0.385 for 50-day maturities. Monte Carlo simulations with vari-
ance reduction techniques (AS, CV, IS) had slightly higher RMSE values, ranging between 0.485
and 0.686. ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP) had significantly higher RMSE values,
with XGBoost at 6.307, random forest at 5.097, and MLP at 21.351 in weekly predictions.

It is important to emphasize that effective risk management is needed for financial stability.
Regression analysis helps in quantifying and mitigating potential risks, specifically in volatility
forecasting [38,39]. Predicting market volatility is important for risk assessment. ML models,
including mnemonic DL techniques, have been developed to forecast midterm stock volatility,
thereby helping in risk management and investment decisions [39]. Identifying anomalies in
financial data is  needed  for potential risks. ML  models can detect  deviations  from  expected
patterns, enabling proactive risk mitigation strategies. The paper [40] presents findings on fi-
nancial  anomaly  detection,  with  DL  models,  gated  recurrent  units  (GRU)  with  an  attention
mechanism (CA Module). The paper highlights traditional statistical models, such as distance-
based outlier detection and density-based clustering approaches, with high-dimensional finan-
cial datasets. While methods like DBSCAN and k-NN have been used for anomaly detection,
they suffer from high computational costs and parameter sensitivity when applied to large-scale
market data. To overcome these challenges, the research introduces a hybrid GRU-CA model
that improves anomaly detection. The GRU model, a variant of RNNs, addresses the vanishing
gradient problem associated with traditional long-sequence financial data analysis. The results
showed that GRU effectively retains long-term dependencies in financial time series data, mak-
ing it superior to RNNs for market anomaly detection. The CA module improves the model’s
ability to filter relevant information by assigning different weights to market features, reducing
noise, and increasing accuracy in detecting fraudulent or irregular trading patterns. The empir-
ical evaluation was conducted using S&P 500 index data, where 70% of the dataset was used
for training and 30% for testing. The RMSE metric was used to assess model performance. The
findings show that the GRU model alone achieved an RMSE of 13.28, 13.27, and 13.29 across
different prediction horizons, whereas the GRU-CA hybrid model significantly improved accu-
racy,  reducing  RMSE  to  9.76,  9.78,  and  9.74,  demonstrating  its  superior  ability  to  identify
anomalies  and  estimate  financial  risks.  On  the  other  hand,  the  paper  [41]  presents  anomaly
detection in dynamic and evolving data environments. The research focuses on unsupervised
anomaly detection methods and categorizes existing anomaly detection approaches into 3 main
model-based categories: statistical-based models, clustering-based models, and nearest-neigh-
bor models. The statistical-based approaches aim to model the normal behavior of a dataset and
identify outliers as data points that significantly deviate from this normal distribution. The study
highlights the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a commonly used statistical method, where
an  anomaly  score  is  assigned  based  on  the  probability  of  data  deviation  from  the  estimated
distribution. However, an underlying data distribution is required for effective anomaly detec-
tion, which limits its adaptability to evolving data streams.

The clustering-based approaches divide data into groups and classify anomalies based on
their deviation from  established clusters. BIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering
using hierarchies) is one of the earliest clustering-based anomaly detection techniques, designed
to  process  large  databases  efficiently.  The  study  also  presents  CluStream,  which  extends
BIRCH by incorporating temporal characteristics of clusters for evolving data. Another signif-
icant advancement discussed is DenStream, a density-based clustering approach that improves
on DBSCAN for detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters while handling noisy data streams. The
DStream model further improves these methods by integrating grid-based clustering, signifi-
cantly  reducing  computational  overhead  in  anomaly  detection. The  nearest-neighbour-based
techniques evaluate anomalies by measuring the distance between data points and their closest
neighbours. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) anomaly detection and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
are identified as highly effective for identifying localized anomalies in high-dimensional data.
The study discusses incremental adaptations of these models for streaming data, such as iLOF
(Incremental Local Outlier Factor), which updates local outlier scores dynamically as new data
points arrive. However, memory and time complexity constraints pose challenges for real-time
implementation. The comparative results found was presented in Table 2.

Conclusion. This systematic review analyzed the impact of ML and DL models in financial
modeling, with a focus on classification and regression problems. The study explored ML/DL ap-
plications in credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, stock price prediction, volatility
forecasting, and option pricing, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and real applicability. A
total of 41 papers were reviewed to assess emerging trends, model performance, and existing re-
search gaps. Findings indicate that ML and DL models have improved financial decision-making
by improving predictive accuracy, risk assessment, and trading efficiency. In credit scoring, DL
models such as DBN and CNNs showed good performance over traditional ML models like logistic
regression and decision trees. However, challenges such as fairness in credit decision-making and
regulatory compliance remain concerns for widespread adoption. Fraud detection techniques using
random forests, XGBoost, CNN, and hybrid models like CNN-AdaBoost achieved high detection
accuracy. In stock price prediction, traditional linear regression models performed well for short-
term forecasting but struggled with market complexities. LSTM networks outperformed traditional

methods. In option pricing, hybrid models such as BS-ANN outperformed traditional pricing meth-
ods by reducing mispricing errors and improving stability. Monte Carlo simulations provided com-
parable results but were computationally expensive, limiting their real-time application. Anomaly
detection remains an important area in financial risk management. Future research directions should
focus on explainable AI methods to improve model transparency, federated learning to improve
data privacy in financial applications, and quantum computing to address computational limitations
in high-dimensional modelling tasks.

СИСТЕМАТИЧНИЙ ОГЛЯД ГЛИБОКОГО ТА МАШИННОГО НАВЧАННЯ
ДЛЯ ФІНАНСОВОГО МОДЕЛЮВАННЯ

Машинне навчання (ML) і глибоке навчання (DL) покращують фінансову аналітику, зокрема кредитний скоринг,
виявлення шахрайства, прогнозування цін на акції та ціноутворення опціонів. Традиційні методи не справляються з
великими масивами даних і складністю ринків, що робить ML/DL необхідними для підвищення точності та оцінки
ризиків. У цьому огляді проаналізовано найсучасніші програми ML/DL, порівняно методології, ефективність та про-
блеми, такі як інтерпретованість моделей, якість даних та концептуальний дрейф. У цій статті розглядаються
застосування ML та DL для класифікації та регресійних задач у фінансовій сфері, оцінюються їхні методології, ефе-
ктивність та проблеми. Хоча попередні дослідження підкреслили ефективність мереж глибокого переконання (DBN),
згорткових нейронних мереж (CNN) і мереж з довгою короткочасною пам'яттю (LSTM), невирішеними залишаються
питання інтерпретованості моделей, якості даних і адаптивності до фінансових ринків, що розвиваються. Багато
моделей  ML  та  DL  функціонують  як  «чорні  скриньки»,  що  обмежує  їхню  прозорість  для  регульованих  фінансових
середовищ. Крім того, фінансові дані страждають від незбалансованого розподілу та шуму, що впливає на точність
моделей.  Проблема  концептуального  дрейфу  також  зберігається,  оскільки  ринкові  умови  змінюються  з  часом,  що
робить статичні моделі менш надійними. Результати показують, що моделі DL перевершують традиційні підходи.
CNN та DBN покращують кредитний скоринг, а випадкові ліси та XGBoost досягають 99,6% точності у вияв-
ленні  шахрайства.  LSTM-мережі  досягають  93  %  точності  у  прогнозуванні  цін  на  акції,  перевершуючи  регресійні
моделі. У ціноутворенні опціонів гібриди Black-Scholes-ANN покращують стабільність і точність порівняно з мето-
дами Монте-Карло. Моделі GRU-CA покращують виявлення аномалій, зменшуючи RMSE з 13,28 до 9,74, а GCN пере-
вершують CNN, досягаючи 94,5% точності виявлення шахрайства. Залишаються проблеми з пояснюваністю, ціліс-
ністю  даних  і  адаптивністю  до  ринку.  Майбутні  дослідження  мають  бути  зосереджені  на  пояснюваному  ШІ,
федеративному  навчанні  та  гібридних  моделях ML-економетрії  для  підвищення  точності, прозорості  та реальної
застосовності у прийнятті фінансових рішень.

Key Findings

1. Traditional peer-grouping methods, such as industry codes or static style boxes, are coarse and

rigid. Modern investment requires **adaptive, data-driven similarity systems** that quantify

closeness based on actual risk and thematic exposures, not pre-defined labels. Advances in metric

learning and large language models enable the construction of flexible, operational neighborhoods

for securities and funds.

2. Evaluation must shift from abstract academic metrics to operational validity. The core focus is

on substitution fidelity, neighborhood stability across regimes, and segment utility for decision-

making. This ensures that models are transparent, auditable, and withstand the scrutiny of

compliance and fiduciary accountability.

3. Effective similarity requires moving beyond single data types to fuse heterogeneous sources.

Models must integrate tabular fundamentals, time-series performance, textual disclosures, and

relational graph structures. This allows practitioners to achieve robust peer discovery and align

narratives with market dynamics, tackling the sparsity inherent in financial data.

Abstract

Clustering and similarity learning are increasingly indispensable for structuring heterogeneous

financial data and supporting real-world decision making. Traditional heuristics such as indus-

try codes, static style boxes, or return correlations, offer only coarse and rigid notions of peer

groups. Recent advances in metric learning, graph methods, and large language models now make

it possible to build adaptive neighborhoods of securities, funds, companies, and investors that

align more closely with actual risk, liquidity, and thematic exposures. This tutorial synthesizes

these methodological developments and demonstrates their use across major asset classes. Case

studies show how supervised proximities improve bond substitution, how fund similarity systems

reconcile category reproducibility with outlier detection, how multimodal pipelines refine company

comparables for valuation and strategy, and how investor clustering enhances personalization and

Know-Your-Client (KYC) analytics. We emphasize modeling choices that make clustering and

similarity auditable and robust under regime shifts. We also outline their evaluation protocols

such as neighborhood stability, substitution fidelity, and segment utility, etc., which align with

investment, compliance, and fiduciary objectives. Overall, the central message for practitioners

is pragmatic: similarity systems have moved beyond experimental prototypes and now stand as

deployable techniques within real investment workflows.

Financial markets are built on comparisons. Every day, practitioners ask which bond can sub-

stitute for another, which fund belongs to which style, which company is closest to a competitor, or

which investor segment shares similar behaviors. Clustering and similarity learning formalize these

judgments, transforming them from ad hoc heuristics into systematic, data-driven frameworks. What

began as rule-based taxonomies and simple ratio screens has grown into a toolkit that can integrate

fundamentals, returns, text, graphs, and alternative data to uncover meaningful neighborhoods across

diverse asset classes.

The promise of these methods is straightforward: they help organize complexity. Vast universes of

securities, funds, or clients can be reduced to interpretable groups, and those groups can be aligned

with real economic attributes such as credit risk, liquidity, or thematic exposure (Exhibit 1). Peer sets

become the foundation for tasks as varied as pricing, hedging, allocation, surveillance, and compliance.

Properly designed, clustering and similarity tools provide practitioners with a transparent way to align

analytics with fiduciary and regulatory objectives.

Exhibit 1: Usecases of Clustering and Similarity Learning in Financial Markets.

Yet practical use requires care. Unlike supervised prediction, similarity has no universal ground

truth. The definition of “peer” depends on context, data modality, and market regime. Outputs can

shift with parameter choices, and advanced models often sacrifice interpretability just when oversight

is most needed. For this reason, governance frameworks such as SR 11-7 place strong emphasis on

documentation, reproducibility, and transparency.

This tutorial delivers a pragmatic perspective. It reviews the range of clustering and similarity

methods available today, shows how they operate across asset classes from bonds and funds to com-

The aim is to equip practitioners with a field guide to design robust, interpretable, and scalable sys-

tems that make similarity learning a dependable part of financial workflows.

Clustering and Similarity Learning Methodologies

Before discussing different techniques, we first clarify important nuances of clustering and similarity

learning. At a high level, clustering discovers groups directly from data without labels, while similarity

learning focuses on constructing or learning a measure of closeness that can drive retrieval, ranking,

substitution, or downstream modeling.

What practitioners mean by clustering

Clustering is the process of grouping financial instruments, funds, or investors into sets where members

share similar characteristics, such as risk profile or performance behavior, while being different from

those in other sets. Clustering is usually thought of as an unsupervised learning task, that is, the

grouping is learned without resorting to any target variable(s). In this setting, the notion of close-

ness is typically governed by a pre-specified similarity or distance function (for example, Euclidean

distance, correlation-based distance, or mixed-type dissimilarities), rather than being learned from

labeled supervision (common distance metrics are summarized in Exhibit 2). Thus, the effectiveness

of clustering hinges on how well this chosen metric captures the underlying economic structure of the

data.

Clustering methods across modalities Clustering provides a flexible family of techniques to par-

tition financial data into coherent groups, but the choice of algorithm depends on the modality, the

available similarity measure, and the structure of the data. Classical clustering methods have a long

tradition in finance (Marti et al., 2021), from peer group formation to portfolio construction, and

remain central to many modern applications. Below, we describe the main approaches (summarized

in Exhibit 3).

Partitioning methods such as k-means and k-medoids group securities by minimizing within-cluster

distances (Jain et al., 1999). They are fast and effective for tabular data in equities and bonds, though

they require a pre-set number of clusters; k-medoids is more robust to outliers.

Hierarchical clustering builds nested trees. Dendrograms enable drill-down views and align with

portfolio hierarchies. In practice, it supports Hierarchical Risk Parity (Lopez de Prado, 2016), which

delivers more stable allocations under estimation error (Raffinot, 2017).

5

Density-based clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) defines clusters as dense regions separated by

sparse areas. It avoids pre-specifying cluster counts and is well-suited to detecting niche cohorts or

anomalies such as fraud and rare assets.

Model-based clustering assumes data come from a mixture of distributions, often Gaussian. It yields

soft memberships and provides natural uncertainty estimates.

Finance often faces mixed-type tabular data that combinine numeric, ordinal, categorical, and sparse

indicators. Measures such as Gower (Gower, 1971), k-prototypes, and generalized dissimilarities allow

clustering without forcing all variables into numeric space.

Time-series clustering extends these methods to sequential data. Distances include correlation,

ultrametrics from minimum spanning trees, dynamic time warping (DTW), Kullback–Leibler diver-

gence, Wasserstein distance, and others. Rolling windows reveal co-movement regimes while adapting

to structural breaks.

Text clustering embeds documents via TF–IDF or transformer models, then applies partitioning

or hierarchical methods (Manning et al., 2008). Applications include grouping prospectuses, earnings

calls, and filings to integrate qualitative signals.

Graph clustering analyzes relational data, where nodes represent entities and edges represent eco-

nomic ties. Methods include community detection, modularity optimization, and embeddings such

as node2vec (Grover & Leskovec, 2016; Satone et al., 2021), widely used in systemic risk and peer

discovery.

Image and spatial clustering uses embeddings from convolutional or Siamese networks with par-

titioning or density-based grouping.

In real estate, property and satellite images are clustered for

comparables, collateral risk, and geographic exposure (Poursaeed et al., 2017).

What practitioners mean by similarity learning

Whereas typically clustering methods take a predefined notion of “closeness” in the form of a pre-

chosen similarity or distance metric, similarity learning formalizes the notion of closeness by learning

the distance metric using the given data: the goal here is to learn a distance or similarity function

that keeps “positives” close and “negatives” apart (contrastive and triplet paradigms), with extensive

surveys covering both classic vector data and structured objects (Kulis, 2013).

In practice, this takes several forms. Supervised similarity uses known equivalences—such as funds

in the same category or bonds with interchangeable features—to shape embeddings, with product

taxonomies or analyst coverage serving as weak labels. Semi-supervised and self-supervised similarity

leverage abundant unlabeled data, for example by forecasting in time series or masked modeling in

text, reducing dependence on noisy human labels.

Another distinction is between global metrics, which apply across all entities, and local or adaptive

metrics, which adjust by region, class, or query. Finance often requires task-specific similarity (for

example, liquidity substitution versus credit risk), supported by multi-task learning that shares infor-

mation while tailoring metrics to objectives. Finally, feature-weighted similarity methods emphasize

the attributes most relevant to the task, ensuring neighborhoods and clusters reflect real operational

needs (Ghashti & Thompson, 2025a,b).

In practice, this enables models to focus on the features most relevant to the financial task at

hand, whether prioritizing liquidity, credit, temporal dynamics, or textual content, thereby producing

neighborhoods and clusters that better reflect operational realities.

Similarity learning in finance goes beyond embedding vectors into latent spaces. It often requires

structured similarity, where relationships such as portfolio proximities, issuer–security hierarchies, or

temporal links are preserved. Graph-based and multimodal methods capture these structures, ensuring

that closeness respects domain constraints. Overall, similarity learning is not a single technique but a

flexible toolkit, adaptable to the context-specific definitions of “peer” that practitioners need.

Similarity learning methods Modern finance provides diverse modalities such as tabular, time

series, text, images, and graphs, and so on, and similarity methods must adapt accordingly. Below we

outline the main families of methods (summarized in Exhibit 4).

Metric learning (Kulis, 2013) transforms input space so that similar instances move closer and

dissimilar ones farther apart. Classical methods include Mahalanobis and LMNN, which learn linear

transformations to reshape geometry around task-specific closeness. Kernel metric learning extends

this to heterogeneous data by operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, handling mixed variables

and nonlinearities for applications such as segmentation and credit cohorts.

Random forest proximity measures how often two observations fall into the same leaf across an

ensemble, naturally handling nonlinearities and mixed data (Breiman, 2001). It has been applied to

bond substitution, fund peer grouping, and investor segmentation (Jeyapaulraj et al., 2022; Saha et al.,

2024), where supervised proximities align similarity with predictive tasks.

Siamese networks map inputs into embedding spaces using paired examples with contrastive loss

(Bromley et al., 1993). They support real estate comparables, document matching, and collateral risk

assessment (Poursaeed et al., 2017; Das et al., 2021; Viana & Barbosa, 2021). Triplet loss embed-

dings extend this by enforcing anchor–positive–negative ordering, enabling fine-grained similarity for

thematic investing (Schroff et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2025).

Time-series similarity learning uses correlation, DTW, or Wasserstein distances, with recent en-

coders adapting to regime shifts (Dolphin et al., 2023).

Textual similarity relies on transformer embeddings such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), clustering

disclosures and reports to support thematic analysis and peer discovery (Vamvourellis et al., 2022;

Gabaix et al., 2024; Vamvourellis et al., 2024).

Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings from neighborhood structure, useful for

issuer–security links, fund–holding networks, and supply chains. Methods like DeepWalk (Perozzi

et al., 2014) and node2vec (Satone et al., 2021) support systemic risk monitoring and peer retrieval.

Contrastive learning optimizes positive vs. negative pairs rather than triplets (Chen et al., 2020),

and is applied in time-series representation and volatility regime learning (Dolphin et al., 2024).

Multimodal similarity integrates fundamentals, returns, text, and graphs into joint embeddings,

9

using transformers and attention to align signals. Examples include theme grouping (Lee et al., 2025)

and ripple-effect prediction via LLM–graph integration (Xu et al., 2025).

Open-set similarity adds anomaly detection, flagging observations outside learned groups to identify

new strategies, anomalies, or risk clusters (Feng et al., 2024).

Evaluation Methodologies in Clustering and Similarity Learning

Evaluating clustering and similarity is difficult because most methods are unsupervised. In finance,

the focus has shifted from abstract metrics to operational validity: whether peer groups remain stable,

substitutes preserve liquidity and risk, outliers align with expert judgment, and outputs are explain-

able for compliance. Models are judged by their ability to support investment decisions, withstand

regulatory scrutiny, and meet fiduciary duties.

Academic metrics. Classical indices such as Silhouette, Dunn, and Davies–Bouldin measure co-

hesion and separation, while external measures like ARI and NMI test alignment with known labels,

often in fund category reproducibility (Castellanos et al., 2024). Stability across bootstrap samples or

rolling windows is especially important in equities and ETFs (Polinesi & Recchioni, 2021).

10

Practitioner validation. Bonds are tested via K-nearest neighbor (KNN) peer sets that preserve

credit and liquidity (Jeyapaulraj et al., 2022). For funds, models must reproduce vendor categories

such as Morningstar (Mehta et al., 2020; Desai & Mehta, 2021; Feng et al., 2024). In equities, peer

groups should explain return co-movement better than GICS or SIC codes (Barberis et al., 2005;

Molinari et al., 2024). For investors, utility is judged by improved segmentation, personalized advice,

or behavioral monitoring (Thompson et al., 2021; Thompson & Davison, 2024).

Multimodal robustness. As data sources expand, evaluation extends to multimodal pipelines.

Text-based peers are validated by valuation accuracy gains (Dzuyo et al., 2025), graph embeddings

by improvements in risk and counterparty monitoring (Zhou et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2024), and LLM-

driven systems by ablation tests and governance checks such as bias audits (Papenkov et al., 2023).

Fixed-Income Asset Clustering and Similarity

Fixed income poses unique challenges for clustering and similarity (Fabozzi, 2007). Bonds differ widely

in covenants, maturity, callability, and tax status, while trading is often sparse and noisy. Investor

needs center on substitution (finding liquid peers), relative value (benchmarking within a cohort),

and risk diagnostics (flagging outliers or monitoring). Therefore, effective pipelines combine tabular

11

descriptors such as ratings and fundamentals with time-series behavior, textual disclosures, and graph

structures like issuer linkages or co-holdings to create peer groups that are both stable and responsive

to market regimes.

Corporate Bonds

In corporate credit, the most valuable definition of “similar” is one for trades: a substitute must

preserve exposures such as sector, rating, maturity, and optionality, while also working under real

frictions like inventory, lot size, and liquidity. Because trading is intermittent and spreads embed

liquidity premia, desks need peer cohorts to price, hedge, and source alternatives when a target CUSIP

is unavailable.

Unsupervised clustering can identify peer sets based on descriptive features, but its value depends on

business-centric validation such as substitution under desk constraints, turnover, and rolling stability,

i.e., not on abstract indices. Wu demonstrates this by generating corporate bond cohorts under rating,

sector, and duration priors, then validating them against desk needs (Wu, 2023).

Supervised similarity provides a more direct path. Jeyapaulraj et al. show how Random Forest

proximities learn bond–bond distances aligned with desk use cases such as relative value, substitution,

and surveillance, and propose evaluation criteria based on stability and substitution fidelity (Jeya-

paulraj et al., 2022). Rosaler et al. extend this idea with a quantum-cognition metric learner that

improves on tree models in high-yield markets, where noise and sparsity challenge heuristic similarity

(Rosaler et al., 2025).

Relational structure adds another layer. Bonds co-move not only through shared terms but also

through issuers, capital structures, and common ownership. Graph methods capture these links. Zhou

et al. use a temporal bipartite fund–bond graph to show that graph neural networks improve price

and yield prediction relative to time-series models, with node embeddings naturally supporting peer

retrieval (Zhou et al., 2022). Similar graph-based models for default risk confirm the value of encoding

issuer and ownership networks (Li et al., 2023).

Portfolio trading further underscores the need for robust similarity. Nearly one-fifth of U.S.

investment-grade volume now trades in baskets. Traditional overlap metrics often fail to align baskets

with ETF benchmarks. STRAPSim addresses this by matching bonds at the constituent and weight

level, producing closer return-based alignment and improving pricing and execution in portfolio trades

(Li et al., 2025). For practitioners, basket similarity enhances transparency, liquidity sourcing, and

efficiency in less liquid credit markets.

12

Municipal bonds

Municipal markets add another layer of complexity:

issuers range from states to school districts,

tax treatments vary, and covenants are highly idiosyncratic. Trading is sparse, dealer-intermediated,

and costly, with intermittent price discovery (Harris & Piwowar, 2006; Green et al., 2007). In this

setting, supervised similarity has shown strong value. A CatBoost-based framework learns muni–muni

distances from large U.S. datasets and assembles nearest-neighbor cohorts for pricing and surveillance,

outperforming heuristic rules in backtests (Saha et al., 2024). This aligns with desk workflows such

as peer price checks conditioned on risk, tax status, and structure, monitoring category drift, and

identifying comparable trades.

Similarity in munis goes beyond tabular terms like coupon, maturity, or ratings. Textual disclosures

in official statements add insight on pledges and covenants, and their complexity is itself priced (Farrell

et al., 2023). Relational signals such as co-holdings, issuer hierarchies, and geography help stabilize

cohorts when trading is sparse. Evaluation emphasizes operational validity: stability over rolling

windows, substitutes under liquidity constraints, and agreement with expert judgment. Marketwide

municipal securities statistics1 provide baselines for coverage, turnover, and regime shifts.

Securitized credit: MBS, CMBS, ABS

In Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) and Asset-Backed Securities (ABS), substitution and risk are

contingent upon borrower behavior, particularly prepayments and defaults. Classical models segment

pools by loan and macro characteristics such as coupon, seasoning, and geography, and estimate cohort-

level termination hazards (Kang & Zenios, 1992). Bayesian approaches model prepayment at the pool

level with hierarchical mixtures, capturing path dependence and unobserved heterogeneity.

In commercial Mortgage-Baked Securities (CMBS), the key dimension of similarity is termination

risk, since prepayment and default drive pricing and surveillance. Early loan-level hazard models pro-

vided a natural basis for peer cohorts by segmenting mortgages with comparable termination propen-

sities (Ambrose & Sanders, 2003). Mixture survival methods sharpen these cohorts by distinguishing

long-term survivors from at-risk loans (Yildirim, 2008). Geography also matters: local economic con-

ditions such as property values, unemployment, and house price appreciation significantly improve

default modeling and should be built into similarity neighborhoods (An et al., 2013). Evidence from

special-serviced loans shows that workout strategies and default probabilities depend on market con-

ditions, supporting grouping stressed loans by resolution path (Chen & Deng, 2013). Pricing also

reflects information frictions: origination channel (conduit vs. portfolio) introduces systematic differ-

1https://www.msrb.org/

13

ences consistent with adverse selection, which means similarity models for pricing must account for

data provenance (An et al., 2011). Taken together, effective CMBS peer sets rely on hazard-consistent

features such as contract terms, collateral, geography, macro drivers, and origination channel, rather

than surface descriptors.

Housing and collateral markets (linkages to fixed income)

House price and collateral risk models increasingly rely on representation learning from spatial, textual,

and visual data. Vision and multimodal embeddings that combine property photos with street and

satellite context improve valuation and comparables search relative to traditional methods (Poursaeed

et al., 2017; Law et al., 2019; Nouriani & Lemke, 2022). At scale, Siamese networks learn “similar

home” embeddings that drive recommendations and peer retrieval, showing how task-aligned similar-

ity supports comparables in live marketplaces2. Graph and spatial embeddings extend this further

by incorporating neighborhood amenities and geographic context. For example, multipartite graphs

that link homes to nearby points of interest improve prediction accuracy, while attention-based spatial

interpolation weights neighbors according to learned relevance. Both approaches strengthen compara-

bles and provide robust stress testing for collateralized products (Das et al., 2021; Viana & Barbosa,

2021).

Fund Clustering and Similarity

Peer grouping is central to fund analysis. Allocators, such as multi-asset managers and consultants, use

peer groups to construct balanced portfolios, test whether exposures are redundant or complementary,

and design allocations that deliver real diversification. Fund selectors on advisory platforms rely on

peer groups to find comparables and to spot outliers that drift from their stated style or category,

which can reveal opportunities or hidden risks. Sales and product teams apply similarity to identify

competitor funds that can be substituted with home-grown products on recommended lists, a process

that requires precise and auditable measures of substitutability. Regulators and oversight bodies also

use peer analysis to check that funds are marketed consistently with their mandates and that holdings

and performance align with disclosures.

Across these use cases, the peer group is a critical tool. It guides allocation and diversification,

supports distribution and competitive positioning, diagnoses style drift or innovation, and enforces

compliance with disclosure standards.

Categorizations, Clustering and Similarity for Funds

ETFs are often analyzed alongside mutual funds in peer-group pipelines. Early work relied on return-

based style analysis, with Sharpe’s method providing a disciplined way to decompose returns into

style exposures and guide category design (Sharpe, 1992). Marathe & Shawky (1999) documented

misclassifications in vendor taxonomies by applying return-based clustering, starting with K-means

and related methods. Similar findings emerged in studies of equity and mutual fund categories (Kim

et al., 2000).

Through the 2000s and 2010s, clustering was used to uncover structure beyond static labels. Non-

linear methods such as self-organizing maps refined or challenged official categories, as shown in Spanish

mutual funds (Moreno et al., 2006). Double-stage clustering compressed performance and risk measures

before grouping them into interpretable cohorts (Menardi & Lisi, 2015). Flori et al. (2021) shifted from

returns to holdings, capturing similarity through portfolio commonality. Network views of fund–asset

bipartite graphs revealed how popular versus niche holdings relate to performance and crowding risk.

For years, unsupervised clustering was used as a benchmark against vendor labels like Morningstar3

and Lipper4, with the assumption that disagreement implied flawed categories. Desai & Mehta (2021)

demonstrated that this was misleading, as clustering outcomes depend heavily on feature choice, dis-

tance metrics, and hyperparameters; thus, divergence often reflects algorithmic bias rather than label

failure. Castellanos et al. (2024) and Desai et al. (2023) reinforced this by stressing the role of evalua-

tion design. To resolve the issue, supervised validation frameworks have demonstrated that categories,

such as those used by Morningstar, are reproducible with fund features, proving they are systematic

rather than arbitrary (Mehta et al., 2020). Later work applied metric learning and supervised sim-

ilarity to extend these taxonomies, aligning distance functions with declared categories and flagging

inliers and outliers in a manner that is transparent to practitioners and regulators (Desai & Mehta,

2021; Desai et al., 2023).

Recent work expands fund similarity in three directions. DeMiguel et al. (2023) showed that super-

vised models on fund characteristics can identify managers with persistent positive alpha, highlighting

predictive modeling as a complement to similarity analysis. Mart´ın-Melero et al. (2025) compared

sector involvement with financial features for ESG scoring, finding that tree-ensemble methods per-

form robustly across modalities. Zou & You (2025) proposed an integrated framework that clusters

funds by performance patterns and then tests group persistence, outperforming style-box baselines and

producing persistence-aware peer sets for monitoring.

Supervised similarity frameworks bring these elements together by quantifying how far a fund is

4https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/lipper/fund-classifications/

15

from its declared category and flagging outliers with diagnostics that are transparent to selectors and

oversight teams (Desai et al., 2023). Recent work extends this approach with open-set recognition.

For example, Random Forests can be enhanced with distance-based rules that both classify funds into

known categories and detect when a fund lies outside all recognized clusters (Feng et al., 2024).

Similarity also strengthens explainability. Yampolsky et al. (2024) introduced case-based methods

for Random Forests that highlight prototypes, critics, counterfactuals, and semifactuals from training

data to clarify why a model produced a given outcome. Applied to funds, this means that similarity

tools can retrieve nearest peers, surface representative exemplars, and flag boundary cases, offering

interpretable diagnostics that help selectors and auditors trust and act on the results.

Clustering and Similarity of Funds Based on Returns

In funds and ETFs, return histories are a practical basis for peer discovery and style checks. Early work

clustered return paths into interpretable exposures, creating peer groups that could be maintained with

minimal labeling (Pattarin et al., 2004). Subsequent studies linked fund uniqueness, measured relative

to time-series neighbors, to flows, fees, and alpha persistence (Vozlyublennaia & Wu, 2016). For ETFs,

distance choice matters—Euclidean, DTW, and shape-preserving methods produce different clusters,

especially during shocks like COVID, and influence portfolio construction (Ito et al., 2021).

Noise-reduction techniques, such as correlation-matrix filtering, help recover ETF groupings consis-

tent with taxonomies (Polinesi & Recchioni, 2021). Returns-plus-risk approaches add volatility states

to the model, yielding peer sets that capture co-movement and regime-sensitive risk (Lisi & Otranto,

2008).

Clustering and Similarity based on other data modalities

Beyond flat labels, graph embeddings of fund–holding networks such as node2vec generate Fund2Vec

representations that capture relational structure, supporting peer search, recommender systems, and

competitor analysis (Satone et al., 2021). Related work adapts language models like Word2Vec and

BERT to create asset embeddings from portfolio structures, which improve the prediction of valuations,

co-movement, and trading activity (Gabaix et al., 2024). Text-based methods also contribute: NLP

on prospectuses and strategy descriptions reproduces category systems and produces semantic fund

embeddings that align with practitioner views of peers (Vamvourellis et al., 2022).

Table 7 summarizes clustering and similarity methods and their applications for funds.

Company Clustering and Similarity

Identifying comparable companies supports valuation, risk management, strategy, and sales. Analysts

use peers for relative valuation by applying multiples, while risk teams and portfolio managers rely

on peer groups to diversify, hedge, and monitor exposures. Corporate strategy teams benchmark

competitors and map markets, Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) professionals search for targets with

similar profiles, and commercial or underwriting desks use peers for lead generation and risk assessment.

Robust similarity measures, therefore, strengthen decision-making by aligning company neighborhoods

with the attributes that matter in each workflow.

Traditional taxonomies such as SIC (Guenther & Rosman, 1994) and GICS5 offer a baseline for

defining peers, but they are coarse and static. Firms sharing the same industry code can differ sub-

stantially in terms of products, customers, or technology, and such labels do not produce ranked peer

lists necessary for comparables and surveillance. These shortcomings motivate data-driven approaches

that integrate fundamentals, time-series signals, text, graphs, and alternative data into continuous

similarity scores and flexible clusters for both public and private firms.

Traditional approaches and their limits

Historically, practitioners supplemented industry codes with financial-ratio comparisons and simple

clustering. (Bhojraj & Lee, 2002) showed that selecting peers from fundamentals rather than labels

improved screening and explanatory power. Classification from financial statements alone can recover

sectors with reasonable accuracy using tree or boosting models (van der Heijden, 2022). Meanwhile,

network heuristics, such as “common-analyst” coverage, also signal relatedness across firms (Kaustia &

Rantala, 2021). These methods were useful but limited, as they ignore qualitative aspects of business

models and lack the multimodality and adaptivity now required for large-scale peer analysis.

Modern data-driven approaches by modality

Machine learning (ML) on fundamentals supports goal-specific peer sets and clustering. Correlation-

based methods have been used to form tradable portfolios for asset pricing (Ahn et al., 2009) and

to classify stocks into groups that maximize Sharpe ratios in mean-variance frameworks (Kim et al.,

2014). Other work applies K-medians or metric learning on financial ratios (Cai et al., 2016; Dzuba &

Krylov, 2021), and designs “financial clusters” from statement structures that sharpen explanations

beyond industry codes (Fodor et al., 2021). Supervised relative valuation methods use ML to express

5https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/gics

17

predicted multiples as peer-weighted averages, creating valuation kernels that are interpretable and

aligned with comparables (Geertsema & Lu, 2023).

On the time-series side, similarity is often judged by return co-movement. Equity2Vec links news

co-mentions, technical indicators, and sentiment to capture evolving cross-company relations, im-

proving prediction accuracy and trading profitability (Wu et al., 2021). SimStock tackles market

non-stationarity by treating time periods as separate domains and modeling parameter drift, blending

time-series features with firm fundamentals (Hwang et al., 2023a). Other approaches demonstrate that

sparse-autoencoder text embeddings improve correlation alignment compared to standard taxonomies

(Molinari et al., 2024), while evolving probabilistic industry mixtures outperform GICS in predicting

correlations (Papenkov, 2024).

Multimodal pipelines are also emerging. CUBAN combines textual descriptions with peer financials

to forecast revenue and profitability, highlighting how comparables-informed features can enhance

predictive performance (Bae & Hyde, 2024).

Textual data (NLP-based similarity). Text offers a way to capture product–market proximity

and competitive positioning beyond numeric features. Early work showed that cosine similarity of

10-K descriptions reveals competitors, supports M&A analysis, and builds evolving industry networks

(Hoberg & Phillips, 2010). Modern LLM-based methods embed company descriptions to reproduce

GICS-like structures while enabling continuous peer ranking and performance alignment (Vamvourellis

et al., 2024). Benchmarks across transformers and classifiers show strong sector classification from

text alone, with LLM-generated augmentation improving robustness (Rizinski et al., 2024). Hybrid

approaches that link narratives to accounting features boost both accuracy and interpretability in

sector prediction (Dzuyo et al., 2025).

Beyond filings, unstructured website text and images can be embedded for peer identification

and alternative industry segmentation, outperforming traditional NACE codes (Gerling, 2024). The

THEME framework aligns firm profiles with thematic descriptions and return dynamics, producing

adaptive embeddings for theme-based investing (Lee et al., 2025). Multi-task BERT fine-tuning on

annual reports has also been used to jointly learn sector classification, return similarity, and sector

naming (Ito et al., 2020).

Governance needs drive demand for interpretable similarity. Sparse autoencoders can disentangle

LLM embeddings into transparent factors linked to fundamentals and returns (Molinari et al., 2024).

Probabilistic multi-industry models further allow firms to load on several evolving topics, reflecting

conglomeration and industry change (Vamvourellis et al., 2024; Papenkov et al., 2023; Papenkov, 2024).

Finally, text-driven retrieval powers interactive peer-search systems that combine LLM reading, API

18

queries, and ranking for live company lists (Patil et al., 2025).

Graph and network data. Relational data, such as supplier–customer ties, partnerships, shared

investors, and board interlocks, capture economic proximity that fundamentals or text may overlook.

CompanyKG builds a large-scale knowledge graph with heterogeneous relations and node text features,

providing benchmark tasks for similarity prediction and competitor retrieval (Cao et al., 2024). Results

show the value of combining node, edge, and hybrid information to quantify peers. Graph methods

such as GNNs and link-prediction models learn embeddings that reflect multi-hop relationships and

complement NLP by re-ranking text-based candidates with relational evidence. Earlier heuristics like

common-analyst coverage also fit naturally as edges in this broader graph view (Kaustia & Rantala,

2021).

Other studies model the correlation matrix itself as a graph. Sarmah et al. show that learning

node embeddings from such graphs maps correlated stocks into a low-dimensional space, enabling peer

discovery, portfolio diversification, and systemic risk monitoring (Sarmah et al., 2024).

Images and alternative data. Visual cues (product imagery, brand style) and digital traces (web

and app usage) can provide orthogonal signals of market positioning, especially in consumer-facing

domains. Emerging work shows image embeddings can retrieve plausible peers and complement

text/graph views (Kaczmarek & Pukthuanthong, 2024). While not yet mainstream in academic liter-

ature, these features increasingly appear in proprietary pipelines and can refine neighborhoods when

combined with fundamentals, text, and graphs.

Private company similarities. Private company similarity is of growing importance for valuation,

underwriting, venture capital, and corporate strategy. Private-to-private similarity supports tasks

such as benchmarking financial performance among financial analysts, detecting high-growth firms,

screening for credit risk cohorts, and mapping competitive landscapes in opaque markets. Private-

to-public similarity enables anchoring startups to listed peers for relative valuation, benchmarking of

disclosure and ESG alignment, and constructing synthetic price or risk proxies where no market data

exist. Together, these workflows extend the reach of clustering and similarity learning from liquid,

information-rich public issuers into domains where traditional comparables are sparse but decision-

making still demands peer sets.

A first line of research leverages structured registry data such as Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis to build fi-

nancial panels of private firms. Studies show that financial-ratio clustering can recover sector structures

and support benchmarking of profitability, leverage, and cash–flow patterns at scale (Kalemli- ¨Ozcan

et al., 2024). Time-series analyses of private firms’ employment or sales trajectories classify growth

19

paths (for example, rapid-growth “gazelles” versus stable incumbents) via trajectory-aware cluster-

ing (Delmar et al., 2003; Coad, 2009). These approaches ground peer discovery in accounting and

real-economy signals where coverage is sufficient.

When structured financials are missing, textual data become the dominant modality. Company

descriptions, website blurbs, and profile summaries are encoded into embeddings to align startups

with both private and public peers. For example, Company2Vec produces text-based embeddings

of German companies for competitor retrieval (Gerling, 2024), while topic models and transformer

embeddings map global startup ecosystems (Savin et al., 2023). These text-driven methods enable

semantic comparables where numeric data are sparse.

Graph and alternative data extend coverage further. Large-scale heterogeneous knowledge graphs,

such as CompanyKG (Cao et al., 2024), integrate millions of public and private firms with relational

edges that span investors, board members, partnerships, and co-mentions. Graph neural networks and

link-prediction models learn embeddings that more accurately recover competitors and partners than

text alone. Complementary signals from imagery and digital traces also emerge: product photos, brand

cues, and app usage data can position consumer-facing firms semantically, enriching private-to-private

comparables (Kaczmarek & Pukthuanthong, 2024). Together, these strands show that multimodal

similarity systems can extend valuation, strategy, and risk tools into the opaque world of private firms,

supporting both intra-private benchmarking and mappings onto public market anchors.

Investors Clustering and Similarity

Worldwide, financial institutions are tasked with understanding their client base. Based on this under-

standing, these institutions recommend several assets and monitor the performance of client portfolios.

They are often required to update their understanding of clients as their decision-making changes over

time, as investment needs, including financial objectives and risk tolerance change as clients age and life

situations change. This understanding can be gained by measuring investor risk tolerance (Thompson

et al., 2022) and risk aversion (Grable et al., 2024) relative to portfolios through statistical quantities.

Similarity learning offers an alternative approach to measuring clients’ risk by understanding clients

as different investor types and their relation to an institution’s overall portfolio.

Investor decision-making and risk assessment frameworks

Before discussing similarity learning for assessing investor risk and suitability, we first clarify how

clients make investment decisions and how these decisions can be mapped to regulatory and practical

frameworks. Investor profiling seeks to directly elicit preferences, risk tolerance, and time horizons

20

from clients, while revealed behavioral analysis focuses on comparing these elicited preferences with

actual investment choices (Faff et al., 2004).

How individuals make investment decisions, and particularly how they understand, tolerate, and

manage financial risk, has been a central concern in regulatory practice. At a high level, regula-

tors, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority6 (FINRA) of the USA and the Canadian

Investment Regulatory Organization7 (CIRO) of Canada, develop suitability regulations for securities-

related commerce to protect investors. They require collecting client information, including identity,

investment needs, financial objectives, and circumstances, as well as risk tolerance, to ensure that

recommended products and behaviors align with client financial goals. In practice, firms implement

suitability largely through onboarding processes, such as questionnaires and demographic screenings.

Classical risk assessment approaches have been used in financial institutions for decades. Suitability

assessments often use questionnaire-based methods, risk assessment tools, and asset calculators, among

others, which can then be used to recommend suitable assets for portfolios Baloyi & Lotter (2024) and

inform risk tolerance scales Thompson et al. (2022), thereby grouping clients into broad risk categories.

A central question in academic research surrounding suitability is whether current investor risk

assessments meaningfully reflect behavioral realities: does this investment decision align with this

client’s financial goals? Recent work shows that elicited attributes often diverge from observed actions,

which raises concerns about whether existing standards reliably guide investors toward suitable choices

or leave gaps in protection due to behavioral mismatches or inconsistent implementation.

Methodological applications

Clustering and similarity learning have been applied in a variety of contexts; however, an important

and sometimes difficult question is choosing a clustering method that is best suited for a specific

financial dataset. These evaluations include cluster cohesion and separation, similarity choice, and

computational cost, where no single method dominates in all respects (Kou et al., 2014).

The choice of method can substantially affect insights, as illustrated in two recent studies using

a financial wellness survey. One study focused on using the K-means approach to clustering (Phelps

& Metzler, 2024), whereas a follow-up study extended this analysis using seven different distance

metrics (Ghashti & Thompson, 2023). The first, using knowledge- and skill-based measures, identifies

four clusters and emphasizes gaps between self-assessed and actual financial knowledge, which reveal

risks of overconfidence and misperceived literacy. The second approach, using dissimilarity learning

on mixed-type data, yields two clusters that differ primarily in terms of housing affordability, debt,

budgeting, and retirement strategies. Although each method utilizes different similarities, they both

21

demonstrate that financial wellness encompasses both cognitive misalignments and contextual stressors.

As there are no “true” clusters, different similarity and clustering approaches offer unique insights into

the same data that must be analyzed by finance-domain experts.

Behavioral finance, similarity learning and household finance

Identifying meaningful similarities between client trade and transaction behaviors help to group them

into distinct investor types. Evidence from household finance shows that individuals with similar

profiles on traditional financial data (such as income, education level, and self-assessed risk tolerance)

often diverge in their actual saving, borrowing, and investment behaviors. Recent applications of

clustering and similarity for investor classification (Thompson et al., 2021) address this gap by revealing

misalignments between elicited investor profiles and observed decision-making.

Deep clustering has been used to identify heterogeneity in household financial behaviors that con-

ventional demographics overlook (Hwang et al., 2023b). K-means clustering was used on literacy

measures to reveal gaps between self-assessed knowledge and decision-making (Phelps & Metzler,

2024; Hwang et al., 2024). De Luca & Mehta (2023) studied investments in ESG among 5.5 million

households using K-Modes clustering to identify five distinct investor types.

Determining similarity between clients allows financial institutions to better understand how their

clients react to market stimuli and give better advice that aligns clients with their financial goals.

Adaptive similarity learning methods for local information of financial information relevant to cluster-

ing allow methods to adapt to each unique financial dataset. Kernel metric learning has been used for

clustering trade and transaction data of clients to determine trading behaviors under the guidance of

financial advisors and during financial market crashes (Ghashti & Thompson, 2023, 2025a,b).

Pagliaro et al. (2021) analyzed over 1.5 million handwritten and drop-down notes written by fi-

nancial advisors using a Customer Relationship Management system. They used the natural language

processing method of Word2Vec to summarize textual information and achieve semantic similarity

amongst a corpus of text, and then used logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting to

classify whether an investor would decide to move all assets to cash. Shiao et al. (2022) further used

advisor notes, trade and transaction data, digital activity (such as log-ins, emails, and calls), and the

VIX index with gradient boosting trees to predict whether investors would make similar impulsive

trading decisions.

Kim et al. (2023) extended the healthcare analogy of “diagnosis and prescription” to the financial

domain by introducing a healthcare diagnostic framework, Risk Information-adjusted Hierarchical

Autoencoder (RI-HAE), that generates household financial risk scores. Health-state clustering groups

households by similarity and stratifies them into risk-based clusters. In the context of future health

22

costs, Tan & Mehta (2022) applied K-modes clustering to a health and retirement study and found

that their categorizations yielded more accurate cost estimates for personalized retirement planning.

Clustering and Similarity for Other Asset Classes

This section reviews how clustering and similarity are applied beyond the core domains of equities,

fixed income, funds, companies, and investors. We highlight use cases in commodities, currencies and

foreign exchange, derivatives, and real estate (REITs). For each market, we start with practitioner

applications and then summarize traditional and modern methods, organized by data type.

Commodities

Peer groups in commodities support diversification and hedging across energy, metals, and agriculture,

help identify substitutes such as edible oils or battery metals, and interpret futures curves in terms of

contango or backwardation relative to inventory and convenience yields (Gorton et al., 2013).

Traditional approaches. Early studies showed that commodities often move together despite dif-

fering fundamentals (Pindyck & Rotemberg, 1990). Clustering methods such as correlation networks

and minimum spanning trees group assets into intuitive clusters like energy, precious metals, and

agriculture, and track how these groups evolve over time (Lucey et al., 2011). Volatility-spillover

similarity adds directionality, distinguishing commodities that transmit shocks from those that absorb

them (Diebold & Yilmaz, 2012). Clustering can also be applied to futures curves: common contango

or backwardation patterns reflect shared storage and carry dynamics, offering a basis for grouping

commodities by market structure (Gorton et al., 2013).

Modern approaches (dynamic networks and multi-factor curves). Recent studies (Ma et al.,

2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Dahl et al., 2020; Szender´ak, 2018) combine dynamic correlation with MSTs

or connectedness indices to track evolving clusters and risk transmission. For specific complexes (such

as oil), multi-factor models of the entire futures curve provide a compact representation of curve

similarity across time and maturities (Cortazar & Naranjo, 2006). Results consistently show energy

and precious metals form tight clusters, with agriculture being more diverse.

A complementary perspective is offered by Chen et al. (2021), who apply unsupervised learning to

both the cross-section of commodities and the time dimension of trading days. Using k-means and

hierarchical clustering on logarithmic returns (with manifold learning via Multi-dimensional Scaling

and t-SNE for visualization), they recover economically interpretable peer groups across fuels, metals,

and agriculturals. Crucially, they also cluster the transpose of the panel, grouping trading days by

conditional volatility (GARCH-based), which reveals market regimes without imposing ad hoc crisis

23

dates. For practitioners, this two-way clustering links instrument similarity (what trades together)

with regime similarity (when markets behave alike), enabling regime-aware hedging and monitoring.

Currencies (Foreign Exchange)

Similarity in foreign exchange (FX) matters directly for risk management and trading. It guides hedge

program design by grouping currencies into natural blocks, which reveals how shocks and interventions

propagate across the FX network, and identifies safe-haven clusters such as the US dollar, Swiss franc,

or Japanese yen that play a central role in risk parity and drawdown control.

Traditional approaches. Early studies show that exchange rates often transact at round numbers,

with the strength of price clustering varying across currencies and trading platforms (Sopranzetti &

Datar, 2002). Hierarchical clustering applied to return correlations or cointegration has long been

used to identify regional blocks and key hub currencies (Kwapien et al., 2009; Wu & Zheng, 2013).

(Scarlat et al., 2007) examined transitional economies and highlighted self-similar scaling properties

in currency dynamics, suggesting deeper structural clustering even beyond correlation. (Wang et al.,

2012) extended this work using DTW to measure similarity between entire return paths, producing

minimum spanning trees that provide intuitive maps of the FX market structure.

Modern approaches. Recent work emphasizes the use of more complex similarity metrics and

dynamic community detection. Mizuno et al. (2006) and Fenn et al. (2012) showed that correlation

networks and community detection methods uncover currency groups that evolve over time in response

to crises and interventions. Chakraborty et al. (2020) proposed similarity metrics based on the dis-

tribution of return fluctuations, recovering a hierarchical structure of the global FX market that goes

beyond correlations. Fernandes et al. (2023) employed hierarchical clustering to compare West Texas

Intermediate (WTI) oil, fiat currencies, and foreign exchange rates, identifying coherent clusters that

spanned across asset classes, thereby highlighting the integration of energy and foreign exchange mar-

kets. Kremer et al. (2019) demonstrated that political and economic events alter clustering dynamics,

changing the role of safe-haven currencies.

Derivatives

Similarity in derivatives helps in three main ways. It allows contracts to be grouped by their key risk

exposures, such as delta, gamma, or vega (the options Greeks), reduces the complexity of large trading

books by creating representative hedging clusters, and makes it possible to compare volatility surfaces

and curve shapes across different underlyings to spot risks and relative-value opportunities.

24

Traditional Approaches. Option prices across strikes and maturities can be summarized by the

implied volatility surface. This surface provides a natural way to measure similarity: contracts or

markets with similar surface shapes behave alike. Empirical studies show that only a few factors

explain most of the surface variation, so options can be clustered by their factor loadings or by the

overall shape of their volatility surface (Derman & Kani, 1994).

Modern Approaches.

In practice, traders already group options by sensitivities such as delta,

gamma, and vega. Recent learning-based hedging frameworks formalize this by clustering contracts

with similar exposure profiles, simplifying execution and valuation adjustments (Buehler et al., 2019).

In rates and commodities, contracts are naturally organized by the shape of their term structures.

Classic studies showed that government bond yields can be explained by a few factors—level, slope,

and curvature that capture most variation in returns (Litterman, 1991). This factor view underpins

modern practice: bonds or swaps with similar loadings are treated as substitutes, and clustering by

factor exposures is standard in fixed-income risk management.

In commodities, futures curves are

summarized in a similar way. Cortazar and Naranjo (Cortazar & Naranjo, 2006) show that two or

three Gaussian factors describe oil futures, with peer contracts defined by comparable responses to

contango or backwardation shifts.

Across asset classes, clustering instruments by factor loadings provides a compact and economically

interpretable method for managing large derivative books.

Real Estate/REITs

In listed real estate and REITs, clustering by geography or property type helps define peers and manage

risk across regions and sectors. For insurance-linked securities, similarity comes from contract features

such as peril, trigger design, and expected loss, allowing contracts with comparable structures to be

grouped for pricing, benchmarking, and portfolio construction.

Early studies (Gyourko & Keim, 1992; Ling & Naranjo, 1997; Goetzmann & Wachter, 1995) showed

that real estate securities co-move with economic and financial factors and are closely tied to equities.

This creates a natural basis for clustering: securities with similar factor exposures or geographic and

sector footprints form peer groups that support benchmarking and risk analysis.

Economic Scenario Clustering and Similarity

Banks, insurers, and asset managers maintain large scenario libraries for regulatory stress tests such as

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and European Banking Authority (EBA), as well

as for internal capital, Asset–Liability Management (ALM), and top-down risk exercises. Clustering

25

and similarity make these sets usable by curating diverse but non-redundant scenarios, reducing Monte

Carlo paths to tractable representatives, and assessing severity, novelty, and alignment with portfolio

sensitivities such as credit, rates, housing, and labor. They also improve governance by ensuring

scenario selection is auditable and reproducible Borio et al. (2014).

Data modalities. Scenario data appear in four forms: (i) paths (multivariate trajectories of GDP,

unemployment, inflation, and so on); (ii) trees (multistage Monte Carlo or ESG outputs); (iii) pan-

els (mixed-frequency macro indicators); and (iv) narratives (qualitative supervisory texts linked to

quantitative paths).

Classical foundations Scenario reduction addresses the problem that Monte Carlo engines produce

thousands of macro paths while regulators and managers need only a few. Forward and backward

selection prune paths using probability distances such as Kantorovich or Wasserstein, preserving tail

risks while cutting redundancy (Dupaˇcov´a et al., 2003; Heitsch & R¨omisch, 2003).

In clustering

terms, reduction groups similar paths and selects prototypes, creating compressed yet decision-relevant

libraries for ALM, energy, and solvency analysis.

Macro regime identification clusters the economy across time. Hamilton’s Markov-switching model

introduced latent states such as expansions and recessions (Hamilton, 1989), later extended with

dynamic factor models to capture multiple indicators jointly (Camacho et al., 2018). These frameworks

group periods with similar co-movements in GDP, unemployment, inflation, and financial variables,

providing practitioners with structured, regime-based similarity for forecasting and stress testing.

Actuarial economic scenario generators simulate inflation, rates, equities, and real estate for insurers

and pensions. Wilkie-style models capture long-run correlations, while Solvency II stresses calibration

and transparency Moudiki & Planchet (2016); Ahlgrim et al. (2005). Clustering and similarity prune

redundant scenarios to keep libraries of scenarios tractable, but regime coverage must be checked to

avoid losing rare stress states. Once the reduction is applied, quite a few governance and compliance

concerns can be resolved.

Modern methods Vanguard Research (2023) applied machine-learning clustering to classify capital

market scenarios into five states (recession, recovery, expansion, slowdown, and high inflation), showing

how unsupervised methods can build objective taxonomies for scenario analysis and portfolio design.

Trajectory similarity methods align cycles that differ in timing or intensity. Franses & Wiemann

(2020) used DTW to recover comparable phases even when shifted in time. Augusty´nski & Lasko´s-

Grabowski (2018) applied DTW-based clustering to macro series, finding it more effective than corre-

lation when recession timing varies across economies. Raihan (2017) showed that DTW improves U.S.

26

recession prediction, highlighting its early-warning value.

Stress-testing after the global financial crisis emphasized scenarios that are both severe and plausi-

ble. Glasserman et al. (2015) proposed empirical likelihood methods to generate extreme but consistent

scenarios under supervisory limits. Aikman et al. (2024) introduced multi-scenario frameworks that

cluster adverse mixes, demonstrating that multiple grouped scenarios capture vulnerabilities better

than a single baseline.

Authorities now publish standardized paths. The Federal Reserve specifies GDP, unemployment,

housing, and financial variables, enabling similarity checks against past vintages for novelty and redun-

dancy8 . The EBA provides EU-wide templates that can be clustered with earlier designs to ensure

continuity while adapting to new risks9.

Recent work explores generative and multimodal methods. Gustafsson & Jonsson (2023) applies

Wasserstein GANs to generate synthetic stress-test scenarios, showing adversarial training can replicate

and diversify macroeconomic paths. These advances mark a shift toward pipelines where clustering

and similarity support reduction, evaluation, creation, and governance of scenarios.

Practical Tips for Practitioners

Clustering and similarity are powerful tools, but their value depends on design and governance. A few

practical guidelines for financial modelers are below.

1. Define evaluation metrics before modeling. Even unsupervised projects need clear objectives,

for example, for bonds, test substitution fidelity; for funds, category reproducibility; for investors, seg-

ment stability. Choosing Metrics right at the beginning anchors the pipeline in practitioner relevance.

2. Start with simple, interpretable methods. Use transparent baselines like correlation clus-

tering, k-means, or hierarchical methods to set expectations. Only add advanced methods when

incremental gains are clear.

3. Match distance metrics to data. Choose metrics suited to modality: Gower for mixed tabular

data, DTW or correlation for time series, and so on. Avoid one-size-fits-all Euclidean distance.

4. Normalize and pre-process carefully. Scale and distribution differences distort similarity.

Apply z-scores, log transforms, and so on to ensure results reflect the financial structure rather than

units.

5. Use domain knowledge. Credit and liquidity matter for bonds, factors for funds, and risk toler-

ance for investors. Embed expert input through feature selection or must-link/cannot-link constraints

to ensure operational relevance.

27

6. Apply supervised similarity when labels exist. Ratings, fund categories, or client segments

allow supervised methods such as random forest proximities or Siamese networks. These produce

task-specific similarity and richer interpretability.

7. Check stability across time. Markets shift with volatility and regimes. Use rolling windows, for

example, and track stability metrics so practitioners know when peer sets are robust or regime-specific.

8. Document assumptions and design choices. Under SR 11-7, all features, preprocessing steps,

metrics, and parameters must be recorded. Clear documentation ensures reproducibility, transparency,

and regulatory acceptance.

9. Prioritize interpretability. Trust on the end results of clustering and similarity depends on

explanations. Feature importances, SHAP values, or case-based reasoning (Yampolsky et al., 2024;

Rosaler et al., 2024) show why entities are peers, which is critical in regulated contexts.

10. Plan for scale and production. Methods must scale to large universes. Use approximate

nearest neighbors, distributed computing, and retraining pipelines to meet production needs.

Taken together, these principles make clustering and similarity systems interpretable, stable, and

aligned with decision-making and governance.

Summary

Clustering and similarity learning have evolved from heuristic peer-grouping methods to become in-

dispensable tools across asset classes. Traditional approaches relied on static classifications such as

industry codes or style boxes, which offered only coarse approximations of economic relationships. In

contrast, modern techniques enable adaptive, data-driven neighborhoods that better reflect actual risk,

liquidity, and thematic exposures. By integrating clustering and similarity methods, practitioners can

build flexible frameworks that structure complex financial data in economically meaningful and oper-

ationally useful ways, positioning these methods as core components of investment analytics, portfolio

construction, and risk management systems. (Exhibits 6 to 12 summarize clustering and similarity

methods applied in different asset classes and data modalities.)

A central lesson of the tutorial is that modeling choices must be closely aligned with the character-

istics of the data and the intended use cases. Different modalities (tabular fundamentals, time-series

returns, textual disclosures, and graphs) require distinct similarity techniques. Moreover, evaluation

must move beyond abstract academic metrics to focus on task-specific criteria such as substitution

fidelity, neighborhood stability, reproducibility, and utility in decision-making. These considerations

ensure that similarity systems are transparent, auditable, and robust across market regimes, making

them suitable for production deployment in regulated environments. Their applications are already

28

broad, spanning bonds, funds, companies, and investors, and are rapidly extending into newer domains

such as commodities, currencies, derivatives, and scenario generation.

Despite their promise, clustering and similarity methods face important practical challenges. Their

outputs are often sensitive to initial conditions and hyperparameter choices, making results fragile and

potentially unstable. Interpretability is another major hurdle: many high-performing models, espe-

cially deep learning approaches, operate as “black boxes,” complicating accountability to clients and

regulators. Additionally, similarity is inherently subjective and context-dependent, varying according

to the analytical task, data modality, and market regime. These factors underscore that no single

notion of similarity applies universally across all financial contexts.

The tutorial ultimately delivers a pragmatic message: clustering and similarity learning are no

longer experimental techniques but essential, embedded components of modern financial workflows.

To responsibly harness their full potential, practitioners must design robust, interpretable, and aligned

models that align with fiduciary objectives. This requires thoughtful model selection, careful evalua-

tion, and transparent governance. By addressing these issues directly, clustering and similarity frame-

works can provide powerful tools for structuring financial information, enhancing decision-making, and

meeting regulatory expectations.

Several domains remain under-explored but highly promising for clustering and similarity: com-

modities, derivatives, private markets, and ESG. In particular, similarities across private equity, pri-

vate credit, private-to-public transactions, and so on are expected to become major focus areas for

researchers in the near future. Advances in multimodal learning, regime-aware similarity, and open-set

recognition will shape the next wave of applications.

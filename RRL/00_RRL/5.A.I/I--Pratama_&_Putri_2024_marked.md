Abstract

User profiling based on financial transaction patterns is crucial for improving customer segmentation and personalizing financial services. This
study uses clustering techniques, specifically K-means, to analyze transaction data and segment users based on transaction amounts, times, and
types. Three clusters were identified, each demonstrating distinct transaction behaviors: Cluster 0, primarily focused on purchases and occurring
early in the week; Cluster 1, which emphasizes transfers and higher transaction amounts, typically occurring mid-week; and Cluster 2, similar to
Cluster 0 but with a preference for later-week transactions. The analysis demonstrates that transaction patterns, including amount, time, and type,
provide  valuable  insights  for  targeting  specific  user  groups  with  personalized  marketing  strategies  and  financial  products.  The  study  also
highlights  the  importance  of  improving  clustering  accuracy,  as  indicated  by  the  moderate  Silhouette  Score  of  0.33,  suggesting  that  further
refinement  in  the  clustering  methodology  could  lead  to  more  distinct  user  segments.  The  findings  of  this  study  emphasize  the  potential  for
clustering techniques to enhance user profiling, ultimately improving business strategies, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. Limitations of the
study,  including  the  dataset’s  single-month duration,  suggest  that further  research  incorporating  larger  and  more  diverse  datasets,  as  well  as
alternative clustering techniques, could offer deeper insights into user behavior and refine segmentation strategies.

1. Introduction

In the digital financial landscape, analyzing transaction data is crucial for optimizing services and detecting fraud. As
financial technology evolves rapidly, identifying risks associated with digital transactions becomes essential to mitigate
fraud and enhance stability [1]. Integrating data from diverse online platforms can complicate financial reporting for
Micro,  Small,  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs),  highlighting  the  need  for  effective  data  integration  strategies.
Machine learning is increasingly deployed to detect financial crimes and improve cybersecurity, ensuring consumer
data protection. This comprehensive approach, encompassing data governance, fraud detection, and cybersecurity, is
essential for financial institutions navigating the complexities of digital transactions.

User profiling is key to enhancing customer experience and personalizing financial services. By leveraging detailed
user data, institutions can tailor their products to meet specific client needs, fostering loyalty and financial well-being
[2]. Effective user profiling also supports personalized recommendation systems using AI and machine learning, which
suggest financial products based on individual behavior [3]. Furthermore, institutions that understand their customers'
diverse needs can promote financial inclusion, particularly for marginalized groups such as individuals with disabilities
[4].  This  leads  to  improved  customer  satisfaction  and  trust,  while  also  contributing  to  broader  economic  goals  of
accessibility and participation in the financial ecosystem [5].

Transaction-based  user  segmentation  is  essential  for  better  understanding  user  behavior.  By  analyzing  transaction
patterns  using  clustering methods  like  K-Means,  financial  institutions  can  segment  customers  effectively, enabling

personalized services and targeted marketing [6]. Traditional fraud detection methods often focus on broad, common
patterns, limiting their ability to detect unique behavioral traits crucial for identifying sophisticated fraud schemes.
Transaction data from diverse platforms, such as e-commerce and cryptocurrency exchanges, shows that users possess
varied  interaction  patterns  influenced  by  factors  such  as  subjective  norms  and  transaction  conditions  [7].  These
complexities  make  it  difficult  to  model  individual  behavior  effectively,  necessitating  advanced  techniques  for
managing the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of transaction datasets.

Traditional user segmentation methods often rely heavily on historical transaction data, which may not fully capture
evolving  user  behaviors.  This  leads  to  inaccuracies  in  predicting  future  behaviors,  especially  when  users  have
insufficient historical data [8]. Moreover, segmentation practices frequently overlook diverse investor profiles and their
distinct impacts on market dynamics, limiting the effectiveness of market prediction techniques [9]. As transaction data
grows more complex, advanced methodologies are required to account for heterogeneous user behavior [10]. Failing
to integrate real-time data and user-specific variables results in missed opportunities and overlooked patterns, limiting
the insights derived from the data [9].

The need for machine learning techniques, such as clustering, arises from the increasing complexity and diversity of
transaction data. Traditional methods often miss the nuances inherent in transaction patterns, leading to incomplete
insights. Clustering techniques, like K-means, enable financial institutions to segment users based on behaviors, rather
than relying on predefined categories. This allows the discovery of hidden patterns within vast datasets  [11]. These
methods  help  institutions  better  understand  customer  needs  and  preferences,  leading  to  more  targeted  marketing
strategies and personalized financial products [12]. Moreover, machine learning clustering can identify segments that
traditional methods may overlook, providing a deeper understanding of user attitudes and predictive behaviors [12].
Integrating machine learning into user segmentation enhances analytical capabilities,  supporting strategic decision-
making in increasingly dynamic financial environments.

User profiling based on financial transaction patterns requires advanced techniques to capture the diversity of user
behaviors. Traditional profiling methods often lack the granularity to differentiate user actions across different contexts
[13]. Machine learning algorithms, especially clustering, allow for the identification of subtle patterns that improve
classification  accuracy.  Predictive  analytics  can  also  create dynamic user  profiles  that  evolve  as  behavior  changes,
enhancing the accuracy of financial forecasts and recommendations. Techniques like ensemble learning and Gaussian
mixture models can refine segmentation by accounting for diverse transaction characteristics, further enhancing the
personalization of financial services [14], [15].

Clustering techniques, including K-means, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering, are essential for segmenting
users  based  on  transaction  behavior.  These  methods  provide  a  more  precise  grouping  of  users  based  on  their
transactional  characteristics  and  behaviors  [16].  By  identifying  unique  segments,  financial  institutions  can  design
targeted marketing campaigns and offer personalized financial products [17]. The ability to analyze transaction data in
real time provides institutions with insights into current user needs, enabling better engagement and service delivery
[18].  Additionally,  combining  big  data  analytics  with  clustering  algorithms  strengthens  segmentation,  helping
institutions adapt to the dynamic financial landscape and respond effectively to user demands [19]. This integration
fosters customer satisfaction and loyalty by aligning services with actual user behaviors.

Identifying  key  transaction  features  such  as  transaction  amount,  time,  and  transaction  type  plays  a  crucial  role  in
refining user segmentation. The amount of a transaction is a key indicator of user behavior, influencing both spending
habits and fraud detection efforts. Clustering techniques can categorize users based on transaction amounts, helping
institutions identify distinct behavior patterns [20]. Time features, like transactional timestamps, reveal patterns related
to the time of day and transaction frequency, enabling tailored services [21]. Transaction types purchases, transfers, or
withdrawals further contribute to understanding user preferences and enhancing segmentation. By integrating these
features  into  clustering  models,  institutions  can  improve  user  classification  accuracy  and  develop  more  effective
marketing strategies.

This  study  emphasizes  the  importance  of  analyzing  transaction  features  for  effective  user  segmentation,  enabling
financial institutions to offer personalized services. By leveraging transaction characteristics such as amount, time, and
type,  institutions  can  better  understand  user  behavior  and  tailor  products  to  meet  customer  needs.  Enhanced

segmentation leads to customized marketing strategies and improved service delivery based on each user segment’s
unique requirements, maximizing relevance and satisfaction. Advanced clustering techniques also provide valuable
insights  that  inform  product  development  and  service  improvements,  addressing  the  distinct  challenges  of  each
segment.  A  deeper  understanding  of  transaction  behaviors  facilitates  the  creation  of  targeted  financial  products,
promoting  financial  inclusion  and  strengthening  customer  loyalty,  which  is  essential  for  growth  in  a  competitive
marketplace.

Implementing user segmentation based on transaction behaviors leads to better customer retention and engagement.
Personalized strategies enhance satisfaction and foster customer loyalty, as users feel recognized and valued. Financial
institutions can optimize customer service by anticipating needs and providing proactive solutions, improving overall
satisfaction  [22].  Tailored  communication  and  services  reduce  friction  during  interactions  and  enhance  service
efficiency  [23].  Personalized  financial  products  boost  user  engagement  and  loyalty,  driving  business  growth  and
promoting financial accessibility [3]. By integrating user segmentation into strategic planning, financial institutions
can adapt to dynamic user needs, fostering long-term growth and stability [24].

Ultimately, the application of advanced machine learning techniques for user segmentation in financial transactions
offers a powerful framework for improving services, personalization, and marketing. By addressing the complexities
of user behavior and transaction patterns, institutions can gain deeper insights into their customers, foster engagement,
and create tailored solutions that enhance customer satisfaction and drive business success.

2. Literature Review

Clustering techniques are essential for categorizing data into meaningful groups based on similarity, with K-Means
and DBSCAN being two of the most widely utilized methods. K-Means clustering aims to partition observations into
k distinct clusters based on their mean distances, making it particularly effective in fields like marketing to segment
customers and enhance business strategies [25]. This method's robustness is enhanced through iterative refinements of
initial centroids.

On the other hand, density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN identify clusters based on the density of data points,
which helps in detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters and outliers, enabling more nuanced data analysis. The flexibility
of  K-Means  and  density-based  methods  makes  them  suitable  for  diverse  applications,  ranging  from  social  media
analysis to healthcare studies [26], thus demonstrating their importance in extracting insights from complex datasets.

User profiling and segmentation have garnered significant attention in the realm of data analysis, particularly utilizing
transaction  data  to  refine  marketing  and  customer  engagement  strategies.  A  variety  of  methodologies,  particularly
clustering techniques, have been employed for effective user segmentation. Ge et al. demonstrate that user behaviors
within  online  brand  communities  can  be  categorized  into  distinct  segments  information-oriented,  entertainment-
oriented, and multi-motivation users highlighting how behavior-oriented segmentation can enhance targeted marketing
efforts.  In  a  similar  vein,  Martinovska  et  al.  [27]  emphasize  the  importance  of  selecting  appropriate  clustering
algorithms tailored to specific business needs to improve decision-making and user profiling [27].

The  analysis  of  financial  transaction  data  for  user  segmentation  has  become  prevalent  in  understanding  consumer
behavior and optimizing business strategies. Zhao et al. [28] propose an extended regularized K-means approach that
focuses  on  transaction  records,  emphasizing  its  significance  in  online  customer  segmentation  by  incorporating
transaction amounts, times, and types to identify distinct customer groups [28]. This aligns with the study by Zhang et
al.  [8]    which  examines  user  behaviors  through  historical  transaction  records  and  employs  a  DBSCAN  clustering
algorithm to distinguish between normal and fraudulent transactions, thus enhancing the understanding of transaction
patterns  [8].  The  integration  of  transaction  features  such  as amounts  and timings  enables more  nuanced  strategies,
which  are  supported  by  Bilgiç  et  al.  [29],  who  demonstrated  successful  store  segmentation  using  comprehensive
transaction  data  from  a  global  retailer  [29].  Collectively,  these  studies  underscore  the  diverse  methodologies  and
insights achieved through the analysis of financial transaction data, emphasizing its critical role in user segmentation
and business intelligence.

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative force within the financial services sector, enhancing market
segmentation and enabling personalized service delivery. As highlighted by Komati, ML architectures facilitate real-
time financial decision-making, allowing institutions to process transactional data for improved customer segmentation
and engagement strategies through predictive modeling [30]. This capability not only enhances marketing efforts but
also aids in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

Chukwukaelo et al. [31] elaborate on the variety of ML techniques available, including predictive analytics, which
improve corporate financial planning by enabling personalized services, such as tailored product recommendations and
dynamic  pricing  [31].  Similarly,  Olowe  et al.  provide  an  overview  of  ML's impact  on customer analytics and  risk
management, emphasizing its role in transforming data into actionable insights, thereby optimizing market strategies
[32]. Furthermore, Feng discusses the integration of advanced ML methodologies, which leverage diverse data sources
for enhanced risk assessment. This exemplifies how financial institutions can refine products to better align with the
preferences  of  individual  consumers  [33].  Ultimately,  these  applications  of  machine  learning  not  only  enhance
operational efficiency but also significantly improve customer experiences within the financial services landscape.

3. Methodology

Figure 1 illustrates the step-by-step process involved in cluster analysis, beginning with data collection, followed by
data preprocessing, and then applying the clustering approach.

Figure 1. Research Methodology

3.1.Data Collection
The dataset utilized in this study is sourced from Kaggle, a reputable platform for data science and machine learning
resources. Specifically, it is derived from the "Financial Transactions Dataset" available on Kaggle, which contains
simulated financial transaction records for a fictional financial institution. The dataset was generated using the Python
Faker library, ensuring a diverse and realistic range of financial activities. It includes key fields such as transaction ID,
amount,  transaction  type,  customer  ID,  and  transaction  time,  providing  a  comprehensive  overview  of  customer
financial behaviors. This dataset serves as an ideal resource for various analytical tasks, including customer behavior
analysis, fraud detection, and the development of personalized financial services.

3.2. Data Preprocessing
In the preprocessing of the dataset, several important steps were taken to ensure data quality and suitability for analysis.
Missing data was identified and addressed by imputing numerical values using the mean or median (for columns like
amount) and filling categorical columns (such as transaction_type and customer_id) with the most frequent value. If
the missing data was too extensive and could not be reliably imputed, those rows were removed to avoid bias in the

International Journal for Applied Information Management

analysis. Techniques such as deep learning and multiple imputation algorithms are effective in filling missing data
gaps, especially in time-series datasets [34], [35].

Feature extraction was performed by deriving additional features from the transaction_time field, such as extracting
the day of the week, month, and hour, enabling better time-based analysis and helping to identify trends and patterns
based on different times. Data transformations were applied to ensure the data was suitable for modeling. Numerical
features  like  amount  were  scaled  to  a  standard  range  using  techniques  like  Min-Max  scaling  or  standardization  to
prevent them from dominating the model.

Additionally, categorical variables such as transaction_type and customer_id were converted into numerical values
using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Feature extraction often involves transforming raw data into
a more analyzable format, such as using wavelet transforms or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic
feature learning [36]. Efficient preprocessing strategies are essential to ensure optimal model performance and derive
meaningful insights from the data [37].

3.3. Clustering Approach
The K-Means algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering techniques in unsupervised machine learning. It
partitions data into 𝐾 clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centers or centroids. The process starts by selecting
the desired number of clusters, 𝐾. The initial centroids are selected randomly or using methods like K-Means++ for
better  centroid  distribution.  Each  data  point  𝑥𝑖  is  then  assigned  to  the  nearest  centroid  𝐶𝑗  using  a  distance  metric,
typically Euclidean distance:

𝑑(𝑥𝑖, 𝐶𝑗) = √∑ (𝑥𝑖,𝑘

𝑛
𝑘=1

− 𝑐𝑗,𝑘)2

(1)

Each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest. Next, the centroid of each cluster is recalculated by
taking the mean position of all data points within that cluster. This process repeats the assignment step and the update
step  until  the  centroids  no  longer  change  significantly,  indicating  that  the  algorithm  has  converged.  The  primary
objective of K-Means is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which is the sum of squared distances
between each data point and the centroid of its respective cluster:

𝑊𝐶𝑆𝑆 = ∑ ∑

𝑥𝑖𝜖𝐶𝑘

(𝑥𝑖, 𝑐𝑘)2

(2)

𝐾

𝑖=1

K-Means has advantages such as simplicity, computational efficiency, and its ability to handle large datasets. However,
it  has  limitations,  including  dependence  on  the  selection  of 𝐾,  sensitivity  to  the  initialization  of  centroids,  and  the
assumption that clusters are spherical and of equal size. The algorithm also struggles with data containing many outliers
or clusters with varying density and shapes. Despite these drawbacks, K-Means remains a popular choice for customer
segmentation, anomaly detection, and document clustering, especially when the number of clusters is known or can be
estimated.

In the clustering process, the selection of features plays a vital role in achieving meaningful segmentation. For this
dataset, several key features were chosen to capture the most relevant aspects of user behavior. Amount, representing
the monetary value of each transaction, is an essential feature as it helps group users based on their spending habits,
distinguishing between high spenders and low spenders. This feature is particularly useful for identifying spending
patterns and detecting anomalies such as unusually large or small transactions. Transaction Time provides insights into
temporal patterns, such as peak transaction periods throughout the day, week, or year. By extracting components like
the day of the week, hour, and month, clustering can reveal trends in when users are most active, highlighting possible
seasonality  or  time-dependent  behaviors.  Lastly,  transaction  type,  which  categorizes  transactions  as  purchases,
transfers, or withdrawals, allows for segmentation based on the purpose of the transaction. This feature helps identify
user groups with distinct behaviors, such as those who predominantly make purchases versus those who engage in
transfers or withdrawals. By combining these features, the clustering algorithm can uncover underlying patterns in the
data, enabling financial institutions to segment their users effectively and tailor their offerings to meet specific customer
needs.

The Silhouette Score is an effective method for determining the optimal number of clusters in clustering algorithms
like K-Means. It evaluates how well each data point fits into its assigned cluster by comparing its similarity to points
within the same cluster and those in other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to +1, with a value closer to +1 indicating
that  the point is  well-matched to its  own cluster  and poorly matched  to  neighboring  clusters,  while  a  value  near 0
suggests that the point is near the boundary between two clusters. A score close to -1 implies that the point is likely
assigned to the wrong cluster. To find the optimal number of clusters, the Silhouette Score is calculated for different
values  of  𝐾  (the  number  of  clusters),  and  the  average  score  is  computed  for  each.  The  optimal  𝐾  is  the  one  that
maximizes  the  average  Silhouette  Score,  indicating  the  best  separation  between  clusters  and  the  most  accurate
assignment of data points. This method helps ensure that the clustering results are both meaningful and well-structured,
providing clear and distinct groupings in the data.

The Silhouette Score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering results, with a value ranging from -1 to 1. A
score close to 1 indicates well-separated and well-defined clusters, a score around 0 suggests that the clusters may be
overlapping, and a score closer to -1 indicates that the data points are likely assigned to incorrect clusters. The score of
0.33 for the clustering results indicates a moderate level of cluster quality.

With a score of 0.33, the clustering is neither exceptionally good nor poor. It suggests that the clusters are somewhat
distinguishable, but there is still some degree of overlap or ambiguity between them. This value indicates that while
the clustering algorithm has successfully identified some patterns in the data, the separation between the clusters is not
as strong as it could be. There might be instances where data points from different clusters are close to one another,
which could potentially lead to misclassification or confusion about which cluster they belong to.

Improving this score could involve adjusting the clustering method, exploring alternative algorithms, or fine-tuning the
model parameters to achieve better separation between the clusters. Additional dimensionality reduction techniques or
more advanced clustering methods might help in achieving a more distinct clustering structure. Overall, while a score
of 0.33 does indicate some structure in the data, it suggests that the clustering could be further optimized for better
clarity and more meaningful separation of groups.

4.2. Discussion
The clustering analysis results presented in this study reveal distinct patterns in transaction amounts, times, and types
across three clusters. Cluster 0 is characterized by a mean transaction amount of 1876.92, with moderate variation in
transaction sizes (standard deviation of 1143.21). Transactions in this cluster predominantly occur around 11:15 AM
on Mondays, and are mostly purchases. This aligns with findings from previous studies [27], which emphasized the
importance of segmenting users based on time and frequency of transactions. Cluster 1, on the other hand, stands out
with a higher mean transaction amount of 4147.06, showing less variation and a focus on transfer transactions that
occur around 1:35 PM on Wednesdays. The distinct characteristics of Cluster 1 support the work of Zhao et al. [28]
and Zhang et al. [8], who highlighted that larger transaction amounts and specific times can reveal behaviors such as
transfers. Cluster 2, which shares similarities with Cluster 0 in terms of transaction times (around 11:20 AM), has
slightly  higher transaction amounts  and  more  frequent  transactions later  in  the week,  particularly  on  Fridays.  This
indicates that transaction patterns vary not only by amount but also by the day of the week, as seen in the behaviors of
Clusters 0 and 2.

The  visualizations  in  Figure  2  and  Figure  3  further  confirm  the  distinct  clusters.  The  3D  clustering  plot  and  PCA
projections show clear separation between the three clusters, with each cluster forming distinct groups based on the
time of transaction and transaction amount. This separation helps to understand the different patterns of user behavior,
supporting the findings of Komati [30], who emphasized the role of data visualization in interpreting clustering results.
However, despite the clear patterns, the moderate Silhouette Score of 0.33 suggests that some overlap exists between
the  clusters.  This  indicates  that  while  the  clustering  algorithm  successfully  identifies  some  patterns,  there  is  still
ambiguity between certain data points, which could lead to misclassification.

Additionally, the dataset used in this analysis is limited to a single month of transaction data, which may not capture
long-term  trends  or  seasonal  variations  in  transaction  behavior.  This  limitation  restricts  the  generalizability  of  the
findings. Future studies could include a more extended time period and incorporate other factors, such as geographic
location,  socio-economic  status,  or  account  types,  which  could  further  refine  the  clustering  results  and  offer  more
comprehensive insights into user behavior. Moreover, a deeper exploration of the types of transactions beyond just
purchases and transfers could provide a more nuanced understanding of how users interact with financial platforms.

Despite these limitations, the findings of this study have important implications for businesses looking to improve their
customer  segmentation  and  marketing  strategies.  By  understanding  the  specific  transaction  behaviors  of  different
clusters,  businesses  can  tailor  their  products,  services,  and  promotional  campaigns  more  effectively.  For  instance,
Cluster  1’s  focus  on  high-value  transactions  and  transfers  could  be  targeted  with  premium  financial  products  or
services,  while  Clusters  0 and  2,  which are  more focused  on  purchases, could benefit  from  tailored  promotions  or
discounts during peak transaction times. This segmentation approach can help businesses optimize their offerings and
enhance customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, while this study presents valuable insights into transaction behavior and user segmentation, there is room
for  improvement  in  the  clustering  methodology.  Future  research  could  refine  the  clustering  approach,  incorporate
additional variables, and extend the time frame to provide a more comprehensive understanding of user behaviors. The
results of this study underline the importance of transaction data analysis in business strategy, highlighting how better
segmentation can lead to more personalized and effective marketing efforts.

5. Conclusion

This  study  demonstrates  the  importance  of  user  profiling  based  on  financial  transaction  patterns  using  clustering
techniques to segment users effectively. The analysis identifies three distinct clusters, each exhibiting unique patterns
in transaction amounts, times, and types. Cluster 0, primarily focused on purchases and characterized by moderate
variation in  transaction amounts, tends  to  occur  early  in  the  week.  Cluster  1,  with  a focus  on  transfers  and  higher
transaction amounts, tends to occur mid-week, while Cluster 2, which also emphasizes purchases, shows a preference
for later transactions in the week. These findings underscore the role of transaction data analysis in improving customer
segmentation, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and financial products more effectively.

Despite the significant insights gained, the study also reveals certain limitations, including the moderate Silhouette
Score, suggesting some overlap between clusters. This indicates that further refinement of the clustering methodology,
such as using density-based techniques like DBSCAN, could improve the separation between clusters and the clarity
of user behaviors. Additionally, the dataset, limited to a single month, restricts the ability to generalize the findings to
broader time frames. Future research could address these limitations by incorporating larger datasets over extended
periods,  including  additional  user-specific  variables,  such  as  geographic  and  socio-economic  factors,  to  refine
segmentation.

This research highlights the potential of clustering techniques, particularly K-means, in understanding complex user
behaviors  in  financial  transactions.  By  enhancing  user  segmentation,  businesses  can  improve  personalization  and
customer satisfaction, leading  to  more  effective  and  targeted  marketing strategies.  Future  work  will  build on  these
findings by refining clustering techniques and exploring new methods to better capture evolving user behaviors and
enhance predictive analytics in financial services.

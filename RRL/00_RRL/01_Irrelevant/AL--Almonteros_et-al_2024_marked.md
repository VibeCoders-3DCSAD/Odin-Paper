Abstract: Predictive analytics is the process of forecasting outcomes based on historical data. Execution of predictive analytics involves
several phases, namely: data collection, analysis and massaging, identifying machine learning, predictive modeling, predictions, and
monitoring. All phases play a vital role in the prediction’s result, especially the data analysis and massaging or data preprocessing.
This study aims to predict the students’ probability of graduating on time using the students’ demographic profiles, previous academic
achievements (SHS track and grade point average), and college admission results (english, math, science, and abstract). The dataset
was acquired from Caraga State University with 2207 samples of new entrants. This study implemented KNN to impute numerical
data, while mode imputation was used for categorical values. Moreover, binary encoding was employed for nominal data to prevent the
algorithm from ranking the values in order. Seven (7) algorithms were tested on the original dataset and compared to datasets integrated
with LASSO Regressions (L1), Ridge Regression (L2), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) separately. The algorithms involved were Decision
Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Na¨ıve Bayes. The result shows that LASSO Regression (L1)
with the Decision Tree classifier has the lowest accuracy (58%) and AUC score (50%). It also has the smallest number of features
selected (5). Conversely, GA selected thirty-three (33) features with an AUC score of 71% and predicted 79% accurately using the
Logistic Regression classifier. It exhibited a 21% increase in the AUC score compared to the no feature selected dataset (NFS) with the
same classifier.

1. INTRODUCTION

Predictive analytics is the procedure of extracting in-
formation from a data set to forecast future outcomes [1].
Various sectors may employ prediction in their proce-
dure [2]. Insurance sectors may recognize clients with a
high likelihood of attaining illness; through this, the target
client to be offered insurance plans could be known. On
the other hand, retail may study the customers’ reaction
towards a product and oil and gas to project the resources
needed. Despite being applied to diverse sectors, it shares
the exact purpose of “acquiring new information based on
the historical data,” bringing advancement to the company
by undertaking necessary actions and interventions based on
the prediction result. Another advancement, once integrated
into software development, may improve service quality,
which is identified as one of the motivating factors affecting
users’ intention to use the application [3]. In fact, [4] shows
that about 80% expressed interest in engaging in predictive
analytics for their three-years-establishment-plan as part of
their operational process.

Execution of predictive analytics

several
phases: requirement collection, data collection, data anal-

involves

ysis and massaging, statistics/machine learning, predictive
modeling, and predictions and monitoring [5]. Requirement
collection encompasses defining what data the client
is
involved in, the aim of prediction, and its benefits. The data
were then collected, containing all the available variables
defined in the first phase. Data analysis and massaging
involve structuring the data, which addresses missing values
and cleaning attributes to prevent possible erroneous data.
After that, predictive modeling can be processed with
the selected modeling technique; it could be statistical or
machine learning techniques.

An evident application of machine learning techniques
in predictive analytics that solves education-related prob-
lems also exists. Alipio [6] developed a model that predicts
the academic performance of first-year college students in
the Philippines using path analysis. His study concluded
that academic adjustment and performance are affected
based on the SHS strand taken by the student and was
also supported by his follow-up study in the same year.
Aside from that, the difficulty level of college subjects is
also intensively related to the strand taken during senior
high school [7]. The problem now is the presence of a

high number of mismatched SHS strands; this means that
their preparatory education does not directly align with
their college courses, thus defeating the objective of K12
implementation [8] [9]. Other vital predictors contributing
to college academic performance are the admission test
score and the high school GPA [10].

The different pronouncements from the present studies
of which predictors best forecast the students’ performance
open an area of research using real-world data from Caraga
State University. With this, the work aims to develop a web-
based application that forecasts the success to graduate of
a student. In achieving this goal, specific objectives are as
follows:

•

Identify the valuable predictors in forecasting the
students’ success to graduate through the implemen-
tation of feature selection methods: LASSO (L1)
Regression, Ridge (L2) Regression, and Genetic Al-
gorithm (GA);

• Develop predictive models using different classifiers,
namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble,
KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Na¨ıve Bayes;

• Distinguish and implement

the best-performing
model through comparison of the accuracy and AUC
score of the developed models in the developed
application

This study intends to contribute to the body of research
by adding new findings in the field of education and predic-
tive analytics. Furthermore, since the data acquired contains
the pioneer of the K-12 implementation in the Philippines,
it is vital to inspect this together with other pre-admission
data. The findings will also provide a basis for policy-
making or modification of the present admission selection
process in the university. At Caraga State University (CSU),
the only criterion to be admitted as a new entrant
is
passing the entrance exam. However, admission has become
more rigid since the passing of the 1Republic Act No.
10931, known as the “Universal Access to Quality Tertiary
Education Act.” Due to this, the number of takers increased,
requiring a higher entrance score and undergoing different
procedures before the student was admitted. However, based
on the dataset obtained, there is a low number of students
admitted in 2018 who graduated on time. The low number
of graduates suggests that admission score alone is not
enough basis for the predictor in forecasting the “success
to graduate” of a student in the CSU setting.

2. RELATED WORKS
A. Understanding Predictive Analytics Process and its

Challenges
’What will happen?’ is the central question concerning
predictive analytics [11]. Predictive analytics uses historical

Tertiary Education Act, provides free tuition and other school fees in state
universities and colleges in the Philippines.

data that represents future trends to forecast outcomes.
Integrating a prediction could be done through supervised
or unsupervised learning. The critical difference between
the two is that the supervised uses a target variable while
the latter does not; this means that the supervised has prior
knowledge about the dataset through label [12]. According
to Kumar & Garg [5], predictive analytics undergo seven
stages explicitly: requirement collection, data collection,
data analysis and massaging, statistics or machine learning,
[13]
predictive modeling, and predictions and monitoring.
describes these phases as data collection, data cleansing,
model generation, and evaluation. It differs only in termi-
nologies, but both cover the same process. Each phase com-
prises several considerations and has a different technique
to complete a phase successfully. To further understand
predictive analytics, this section discussed the definition of
each phase and how other researchers address the challenges
encountered.

The first phase is called requirement collection, which
analyzes what specific prediction is to forecast. The end
goal of the prediction must be evident in the first place, and
that must be defined in this phase. For instance, a prediction
could be straightforward ’yes or no’ only, such as predicting
if a credit card is a fraud or not [14]. It could also forecast
more than two classifications, such as [15] recognizing
chronic kidney diseases or early detection of possible heart
disease [16]. The latter study aims to classify if the patient
may have either coronary artery, vascular disease, heart
rhythm disorder, structural heart disease, or heart failure in
the future. It is essential to state the goal of the prediction
explicitly. Aside from classification, the prediction’s output
may also be numerical, such as employing this in sales
forecasting [17]. The first phase in applying predictive is
pigeonholing the goal of the prediction. With this,
the
possible data to be collected could be identified, leading
to the data collection phase. Data collection is simply
the process of acquiring a dataset required to develop
the predictive model [5]. However, almost all of the raw
data acquired needs to be structurally ready before feeding
into developing a predictive model [18]. Hence, it needed
to be cleaned and revised to correct errors and handle
missing values [13]. This phase is called data analysis
and massaging or data preprocessing. Thus, challenges and
issues were discussed in the following sections.

Once the data is preprocessed and converted into a struc-
tural form that is ready for predictive modeling, the next
phase is the election of either statistics or machine learning
techniques to use in forecasting. All the predictive analytics
models are based on statistical and/or machine learning;
however, machine learning techniques have an advantage
over the other [5]. Machine learning focuses on forecasting,
while traditional statistics explains the relationship between
variables [19]. Nevertheless, machine learning improved
model discrimination compared to conventional statistical
approaches [20]. The performance of prediction results also
differs in relation to the dataset and the technique incorpo-

rated, especially if preprocessing was considered [21]. The
study of Osisanwo et al [22] explored different algorithms
to determine the most efficient classification algorithm. Two
datasets were used containing 768 and 384 samples; though
classifiers do not rank the same to both datasets, it could
be seen that all classifiers increased in accuracy compared
to the smaller dataset, thus showing that a larger data set is
more effective in classifying.

Predictive Modeling is a process based on statistical or
machine learning techniques that are tested by partitioning
the dataset
into training and test datasets [5]. This is
done to evaluate the integrated machine-learning algorithm.
Muraina [23] stated that most scholars’ suggestion is to
split the dataset with 100 – 1,000,000 into a 70/30 ratio;
otherwise, 90/10. Randomized or cross-validation, on the
other hand, is also the standard method of splitting the
algorithm’s performance [24].

After the predictive modeling,

the last phase is the
model’s deployment or the ”prediction and monitoring” [5].
After developing the model, the best algorithm could be
implemented using the Django web-based framework, the
same as the stock market price prediction [25]. The Django
framework offers an easy-to-use library and is scalable
in rapid development. Indeed, automation is possible with
the Django framework as a web-based application that
automates the student schedule following a decision tree-
based rule that was successfully implemented [26]. The
monitoring takes place by evaluating its prediction using the
new data. It is an unending task to ensure that the model
is able to forecast effectively beneficial to the company’s
decision-making process and primarily used in marketing
and sales [4].

B. Missing Data

Pre-processing the data may include treatment of miss-
ing data. Missing data may lead to inaccuracy of predic-
tion [18]. It was found out by Nijman [27] through their
literature review that no sufficient information for handling
missing data was presented in most prediction models using
machine learning.

Several strategies address missing data problems: list-
wise deletion, mean-mode substitution, and imputation.
Listwise deletion is the easiest way among strategies but is
the least recommended. Listwise deletion involves removing
data that leads to data reduction that may affect the pre-
dictive model’s performance [28]. Mean-mode substitution
substitutes the mean for numerical and the most common
value to missing categorical data. Imputation is substituting
the estimated value for the missing data [29]. Imputation
comes in many methods; MICE and KNN imputation are
among the popular methods for handling missing data.
These two strategies were also found to perform best [30],
in
but MICE is a complex algorithm and works well
small datasets, which gives KNN a lead over MICE [31].
In addition, KNN imputation also performed best among
other methods in a numeric dataset [29]. The comparison

includes mean, median, predictive mean matching, and
linear and Bayesian regression methods. However, for non-
numeric and nominal, mode was used to replace missing
data when comparing the performance of KNN (N=5) and
Mean-median imputation train and both accuracy at 99 and
above [32].

C. Feature Selection

Moreover, aside from solving missing data, choosing
features efficiently will lead to better prediction results [16].
Feature selection is a tool that provides a list of significant
features to prevent computational overload [33]. Features or
columns not related to other features are considered noises,
which causes a low prediction score. Choosing a feature
selection technique depends on the problem. Supervised
learning consists of three feature selection techniques –
filter, wrapper, and embedded.

Filter-based feature selection is a technique that chooses
the significant features. It is faster than a wrapper; however,
its downfall is that it does not consider relationships be-
tween features. Also, it does not associate with the classifier
algorithm, an advantage of an embedded technique. On the
other hand, the wrapper and embedded look for a relevant
subset that a filter-based solution lack [34].

The Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO) and ridge regression, a filter-based feature selec-
tion both use regularization to prevent overfitting. LASSO
uses L1 regularization to shrink the coefficients of less
important features to zero, leading to a decrease of the
total feature. On the other hand, ridge regression uses L2
regularization. It shrinks the coefficient of all the features
but not to zero, unlike L1. LASSO regression is said to
work better in small number features while the later on
large predictors [35]. The study of Zhang et al. [36] used
the LinearSVC algorithm with Lasso (L1) regularization as
a feature selector and showed a high-accuracy prediction
result. Though the said study dealt with a binary classifica-
tion problem - which is the same as the problem that this
work is trying to solve, it is also essential to consider that
the wrapper chose more imperative features than the filter
method applied in a classification problem [37]. Though
Genetic Algorithm (GA), a wrapper feature selector, was not
included in the mentioned research, the later year itemized
that GA showed promising outcomes. The experimental
study explored five (5) dataset classification problems and
thus concluded that the dataset with feature selected by GA
outperformed classifiers using the original feature and other
feature selectors [38].

D. Data Encoding

The problem mostly with feature selection is that ap-
proaches were designed for numerical values [39]. We can
assign a numerical value in each category; however, it is
only acceptable if the data is ordinal [40]. Ordinal coding
is practical when data implies order or ranking [41]. For
instance, the salary range is from 1,000-501, 500-201, and
200-1, thus encoded as 3,2,1; this could be interpreted as 3 <

https:// journal.uob.edu.bh/

700

Almonteros, et al.: Forecasting Students’ Success To Graduate Using Predictive Analytics

2 < 1, which is true since 1,000 < 500 < 200. In some cases,
red, blue, and green will be numbered as 3,2,1, respectively.
It will lead to an interpretation of red < blue < green, which
is false. The findings showed that ordinal encoding gained
the lowest accuracy rate of 81% compared to the other 7
encoding methods. With this, converting non-numerical and
non-ordinal/nominal features is handled in another way.

According to Seger [42], one-hot can be used, feature
hashing or binary encoding to convert a categorical feature
to a numerical value. The most popular approach is One-hot
encoding (OHE). Using the OHE approach, each category
represents a dimension where the size of the dimension
is equal to the number of categories, but only one space
is equal to 1; the rest is zero, thus making each category
unique [39]. The disadvantage of this approach is that the
feature’s dimension is also significant when there are many
categories, leading to storage and efficiency problems [42].
Meanwhile, feature hashing can solve this issue. Feature
hashing is implemented variously, but all use a hash func-
tion, thus reducing the encoding size of non-numerical data;
however, it is primarily used in large-scale datasets. The last
technique is binary encoding, where a number is assigned to
a category first before converting to a corresponding binary
value and then divided into columns. It is said to take the
size of log2, which is smaller than one hot encoding.

E. Students’ Predictors to Academic Success

Over the past years, several studies have been conducted
concerning important features to forecast student academic
success. In relation to this, Alyahyan & D¨us¸teg¨or [43]
discussed the best practices in predicting academic success
through a literature review, thus enumerating the predic-
tors used by other studies. The use of prior academic
achievement of the student has the highest number of
reoccurrences as a predictor of the mentioned problem. It
was also followed by students’ demographics, environment,
psychological, and e-learning activity.

The presence of the last three predictors is evidence of
an underlying relationship between the student’s environ-
ment, psychology, and e-learning activity. However, the data
could only be captured once the student was admitted to the
university. More likely, it could only be acquired after one
semester, which defeats the primary purpose of this study
since it aims to predict student success before its official
admission. Therefore, the study will adopt the first two
sets of predictors, which, according to the literature review
conducted by [43]: prior academic achievement as predic-
tors in a dataset was used at 44% of all existing research
related to student success. It consists of pre-admission data
such as test results, GPA, and high school background
as influencing factors. Secondly, the student demographics
(25%), which predictors include gender, age, residence,
parent’s education, occupancy, and family income.

Furthermore, more recent research has supported the
importance of the student’s prior academic achievement
as a contributor to their college success, particularly the

SHS track [7]. Nevertheless, admission test scores and
high school GPA were highly studied, and it concluded
that both are potent predictors as contributors to drop
rate [10] [44] [45]. The existence of the mentioned predic-
tors in the literature shows their relevance as factors con-
tributing to a student’s success. Moreover, these influencing
factors were available in the pre-admission data at
the
university and, thus, will be included in this study. Table I
summarized the goal, findings, and how these previous
researches contribute to this paper.

F. Researches in Predictive Analytics Domain

Table II contains studies conducted by various re-
searchers in the field of prediction. Each study compared
several algorithms in developing a predictive model. The
researchers of [46]
[47] conducted an extensive review
of related studies to identify the most frequent machine
learning methods. Both researchers agreed that Random
Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes were among the most uti-
lized algorithms; however, the latter concluded that Random
Forest has the highest accuracy rate, while [46] declared
Decision Tree.

The pronouncement of both studies with different al-
gorithms as the best-performing algorithm is essential to
this study since it also deals with prediction using student
data; this shows, however, that results also depend on the
preprocessing procedure, the data itself, and the algorithm.
It also must be noted that studies included in the Table
II deal with either binary problem classification [14] or
school-related problems, such as the possibility of a student
dropping out [45].

Moreover, Table II shows the ensemble model, logistic
regression, and KNN as reoccurring methods. With this, it
is relevant not to conclude that the algorithm declared in
the mentioned studies will also perform well in the dataset
used in this research. Hence, each reoccurring method will
be included in the algorithms to be modeled and compared
based on AUC and Accuracy. Nevertheless, there is no
conflict in their findings since the subsequent studies on
predictive analytics but in different datasets which structure
is unidentical with each other.

3. METHODS

To carry out the needed process in developing a pre-
dictive model, necessary data and methods that will aid the
completion of this study were identified. Figure 1 illustrates
the experimental design conducted based on the findings of
the review of literature conducted. The dataset was acquired
from the university and underwent preprocessing, given that
the dataset contains missing data and non-numerical values,
as shown in Table III. Once it was handled, the preprocessed
dataset went through feature selections separately, and each
selected predictor was used in the modeling in seven dif-
ferent classifiers. The succeeding subsections will describe
the experimental design in detail.

removed because student data through the mentioned years
does not include the senior high school strand, as K 12 was
implemented in 2018. Hence, the study’s goal is to forecast
the new” success to graduate” of a new entrant student. The
prediction classification is straightforward with binary value

B. Data Proprocessing

The acquired raw data has a high possibility of con-
taining missing values. Missing values may lead to the
ineffectiveness of the predictive model. Hence, the dataset
in this study contains mixed data types; it needs to be
handled accordingly with the use of the mode method for
categorical values while KNN for numerical values. KNN

Scholarships. A letter of intent addressed to the university’s
president was approved in October 2022, allowing the
researcher to obtain the data as agreed not to disclose any
sensitive data and strictly following Republic Act 10173 or
the “Data Privacy Act of 2012”. The data was received
via email
in .csv format with the following predictors
shown in Table III. It contains the student records and
admission scores from 2000 to 2022; however, most items
in the previous years were empty, which was removed and

Research Description

Researchers stated that the exclusion of the protected attributes, namely gender, first-
generation student, underrepresented minority (Asian or White), and high financial
need, does not have a significant effect on the overall performance of the dropout
prediction [48].

The research compared machine learning and one deep learning approach in
detecting credit card fraud. ANN, a deep learning technique, ranked bottom among
machine learning algorithms [14].

The study aims to identify the best time to predict a student’s success -during
admission, first semester, or second semester. The first two semesters were found to
be significant, where grades during that semester were included as a predictor [49].

Linear SVC, followed by Logistic Regression, was among the methods that
performed best when a model for employee attrition was developed. The study also
identified factors that influence an employee to leave a company [50].

Comparison with ensemble methods was conducted in this research. Features used
were enrolment data, grades in science, english, and TLE to predict the student
dropout [45].

Forty-eight (48) articles about disease prediction were examined. SVM and Na¨ıve
Bayes were the most frequently used algorithms; however, Random Forest was found
to have higher accuracy [47].

One hundred twenty-one (121) articles were reviewed, particularly on the data source
and variables, data handling, machine learning techniques, and accuracy evaluation.
Findings show that most studies measure students’ performance using scores, grades,
and grades prior to graduation [46].

To obtain a high-quality dataset, it uses the KNN algorithm to impute the missing
values of the data. The model was then trained using SVM and Na¨ıve Bayes, where
the first algorithm performed higher in predicting heart disease [13].

The authors focused on developing predictive analytics to provide decision support
to the administration during admission. Several algorithms were tested, and SVM
overpowered the other algorithms [51].

Compared the number of machine learning approaches using the available student
data before the start of the classes are used to predict the student performance. The
Ensemble model is said to outperform the rest‘[52].

is an imputation technique that estimates the missing values
based on the k-nearest neighbor method, replacing it with
the ’N neighbors’ mean value using the Euclidean distance
metric. The mode method, on the other hand, will chiefly fill
in the missing values with the most common value present
in the particular feature of a dataset. The study of Sessa &
Syed [32] found a significantly high accuracy rate prediction
mode combining KNN and mode handling missing data.
Though the execution of both methods will replace the
missing values in the dataset, machine algorithms take
numerical values to conduct a prediction. Thus, the presence
of non-numeric values will need to undergo the process
of binary encoding. For non-ordinal features, the said data
could not be assigned with a numeric number, for this will
cause the algorithm to think that value is based on ranking
or hierarchy, giving bias to the result.

C. Identifying Predictors through Feature Selection

Moving forward, the dataset will undergo feature selec-
tion using Lasso Regression (L1), Ridge Regression (L2),
and Genetic Algorithm. These three techniques will not
be used together; however, it will be used separately to
compare the feature it selected. Therefore, the study will
test on one of the same datasets but with different feature
selection methods. These are: 1) did not undergo the feature
selection method or the dataset with the complete features,
2) the dataset applied with Lasso Regression, 3) the dataset
applied with Ridge Regression, and 4) the dataset applied
with Genetic Algorithm.

Though a study [53] found out

that applying both
methods L1 and L2, by running L1 first followed by L2,
showed improvement in the result; it could be noted that it
was employed to a dataset with 6,000 features reduced to

to verify by comparing both methods. With this, this work
examined L1 and L2 separately as feature selection.

On the other hand, Genetic Algorithm (GA) will also be
used as a feature selector in this study. Mweshi [38] in their
literature review summarized that GA had been successful
as a feature selector and shown promising outcomes. The
genetic algorithm begins by generating an initial population
of individuals. Each individual’s fitness is then calculated
on how it solves the given problem. Springs were produced
through crossovers, reproduction, and mutation, which are
responsible for creating new generations until they satisfy
the termination condition before returning to the individual
carrying the best solution. This work implemented 150
iterations before achieving the best-performing generation.

50. In this study, however, only less than 100 features are
present in the dataset, implying that the same experiment is
not relevant and equivalent. And In contrast to the findings
of Muthukrishnan & Rohini [54], which stated that LASSO
works better than ridge regression, this study still wishes

With the help of Scikit-Learn and Google Collab, the
preprocessed datasets will be split into 70-30, 70 for the
training set and 30 for the test set. It will be modeled
with seven (7) different algorithms: Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Ensemble Model, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM,
and Na¨ıve Bayes. The general definition of these algorithms
is as follows [55].

Almonteros, et al.: Forecasting Students’ Success To Graduate Using Predictive Analytics

A Decision Tree is a model that uses a tree-like structure
to split data into smaller subsets based on different rules.
It is utilized for both classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest is an ensemble method that utilizes multiple
decision trees. It trains each tree on a random subset of data
and features and then combines their outputs to make a final
prediction. The ensemble Model is a method that combines
the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall
performance. An example of this is using the bagging
method with the J48 decision tree. The k-nearest Neighbor
(kNN) method uses the k-nearest data points to make a
prediction. It could be either by taking the majority class
or the average value of the k-nearest neighbors. Logistic
Regression is a model used for classification that uses
a logistic function to model the probability of a binary
outcome. It discovers the best linear combination of features
that maximizes class separation. Support Vector Machine
(SVM) finds the best boundary to separate different classes
in the data by using a subset of the training examples called
support vectors. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic method
used for classification. It calculates the probability of a
class given some features and assumes that the features are
independent.

E. Evaluation Metrics

This study adopted the evaluation metrics used by Thab-
tah, et al. [56] in their study. There are five (5) evaluation
metrics to use: error rate, accuracy, recall, precision, and
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
(AUC). These metrics were used in evaluating classification
problems and will be derived based on the binary confusion
matrix of the models.

Error rate or misclassification rate refers to the incorrect
predictions produced by the model. The formula to get the
error rate is shown below, where tp is the true positive, tn
is the true negative, fp is the false positive, and fn is the
false negative.

Errorrate = 1 −

T P + T N
T P + T N + FP + FN

(1)

Accuracy denotes the correct classification made by the
model. The formula to get the prediction accuracy is shown
below, where tp is the true positive, tn is the true negative,
fp is the false positive, and fn is the false negative.

Accuracy =

T P + T N
T P + T N + FP + FN

(2)

Recall or sensitivity (true positive rate) is the actual
positive occurrence that was correctly predicted positive.
Models that resulted in higher recall mean that the model
is good at identifying positive occurrences. The formula to
get the recall is shown below, where tp is true positive, and
tn is true negative.

Recall =

T P
T P + FN

(3)

Precision, or refers to positive predictive value, is the
predicted positive instances that are actually positive. The
formula to get the precision is shown below, where tp is
the true positive, tn is the true negative, and fp is the false
positive.

Precision =

T P
T P + FP

(4)

Area under the Curve (AUC) is a way to evaluate the
model’s prediction by measuring the area under the ROC
curve. On the other hand, the ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation illustrat-
ing the classifier’s performance. It plots the curve of the true
positive (tp) against the false positive (fp). This method of
evaluation metric is famous because it is not affected by the
dataset’s class imbalance.

After finding the best-performing algorithm as accu-
racy and AUC as the final basis,
the developed model
will be translated into a web-based application using the
Django Framework. Django is a Python-based framework
suitable for scalable and maintainable application develop-
ment. Moreover, it is capable of running most machine-
learning algorithms, leading to easy implementation and
maintenance. The application’s front end will utilize HTML,
CSS, and Bootstrap.

F. Software and Tools Used

Table IV summarizes the software used to implement the
methods identified above. Microsoft Excel was used during
the preprocessing phase, and Sklearn and Python scripts
were run in Google Collab to handle missing data, binary
encoding, develop and evaluate the models, and export the
model to pkl file. The exported file was imported to the
web application created using Bootstrap for UI and Django
as the framework.

4. RESULTS

This chapter focuses on the discussion of the result
using the methods mentioned in the previous chapter. This
chapter is segmented into five (5) subsections: data pre-
processing, predictive models’ evaluation scores, features
selected, developed web-based predictive application, and
the implication of this study.

A. Data Preprocessing

The actual data was used; therefore, missing data is
inescapable. The acquired data contains twenty-four (24)
features. ’SHS Track’ bears the highest amount of missing
data, which is 1702, followed by ’grade point average’
at 593, age (137), father attainment (90), municipality
and province (both 71), mother occupation (36), mother
attainment (30), father occupation (28), religion (8), NSAE

Result (3), and abstract score (45). Though the presence of
high missing values in SHS track and GPA is prominent,
these features were not dropped down to experiment on the
effectiveness of KNN and mode imputation methods. After
these codes were implemented, no missing values could be
found in the dataset anymore.

Additionally, since the acquired dataset contains eleven
(13) categorical features, specifically sex, program, sta-
tus, generation, civil status, religion name, municipality,
province, father and mother occupation and attainment, and
SHS track, these nominal features undergo binary encoding
before developing feature selection and predictive modeling.
Initially, the dataset contained 24 features; however, after
implementing the binary encoding, it expanded into sixty-
four (64) features, excluding the target feature.

B. Predictive Models’ Evaluation Score

Seven classifier algorithms were tested in four (4)
datasets: The No Feature Selected (NFS) dataset and
datasets employed with LASSO (L1), Ridge (R2), and
Genetic Algorithm (GA) feature selection methods. Table V
summarizes the metric scores for each classifier. No Feature
Selected (NFS) dataset, which contains 64 features, shows
that the Na¨ıve Bayes accuracy score is the lowest (62%),
together with logistic and SVM, with only 50% in the
AUC score. Meanwhile, Random Forest showed the highest
accuracy and AUC scores, 78% and 67%, respectively.
However, NFS outperformed datasets applied with LASSO
(L1) and Ridge (L2) Regression feature selection.

L1, selected only five (5) features and resulted in SVM
with 70% accuracy and Na¨ıve Bayes with only 62% AUC
score as highest. L2, on the other hand, performed better
than L1, with a greater number of features selected, and
predicted 77% of test data correctly, 7% higher than the
same classifier. Also, L2’s SVM exhibited the highest AUC

by 66%, which is only one point less than the random
forest metric score from the NFS dataset. Moreover, Na¨ıve
Bayes scored a 70% accuracy rate as the lowest from the
L2 dataset but is 8% higher when compared to the least
accurate from the NFS dataset.

NFS performed best with Random Forest, followed by
L2’s SVM, but L1 resulted in significantly low accuracy;
thus, the same findings were in AUC metric score. However,
it is evident that the genetic algorithm FS increased the
metric score of all the classifiers compared to the NFS
dataset, L1, and L2. With logistic regression, the accuracy
score increased by 10%, SVM – 7%, KNN and Ensemble
– 6%, Decision tree – 3%, Na¨ıve Bayes – 2%, and random
forest by 1% compared to NFS. The upsurge in AUC score
is also significant, with Logistic Regression on top surging
by 21% more, SVM – 16%, KNN – 12%, Ensemble, and
Na¨ıve Bayes by 7%, and random forest and decision tree
by 3% more than the AUC scored resulted in NFS dataset.

C. Features Selected

Since the data was binary encoded, it splits one feature
into several sub-features based on its categorical values.
Thus, it is reasonable to get the average of all the sub-
features it created.

Table VI shows the result of the feature selection pro-
cess; labeled as F means that the feature was not selected;
otherwise, T for true. Among nine (9) feature selections em-
ployed in this study – L1, L2, and seven (7) classifiers from
GA, the following were ordered based on times selected:
NSAE Result (6), sex (5), mother income (5), English (5),
math (5), program (4.6), father occupation (4.5), mother
occupation (4.2), religion (4), mother attainment (4), family
estimated income (4), science score (4), province (3.8),
status (3.6), shstrack (3.25), municipality (3.14), age (3),
generation (3), father attainment (3), father income (2), and

abstract score (2).

Among features selected, admission result is the most
selected feature appearing as 6/9 compared to GPA, which
appears as 5/9, the same with sex, mother income, english,
and math score. In contrast, the abstract and father income
were selected the least, followed by age, generation, and
father attainment based on their average occurrences in
the feature selections employed as shown in Figure 2. The
result suggests that the current admission selection based on
the admission result is important among features; thus also
showing abstract score in the exam is the least important
area in the admission exam, english and math instead. It
supports the findings [57], who declared that math skill is a
better predictor of university performance. Meanwhile, [58]
in which findings stated that english grade has a substantial
correlation and are a strong predictor of students’ year
general point average toward non-english primary speaker,
such as in the Philippines. Consequently, admission should
consider the overall score in the admission exam and the
specific score in math and english. Moreover, the literature
review [59] stated that gender strongly influences the
dropout rate, as well as parental background and status.
This study, however, specified that a mother’s income plays
a role in the success to graduate of a student. Future work

could explore these features to identify the underlying trend
on sex and mother income.

Almonteros, et al.: Forecasting Students’ Success To Graduate Using Predictive Analytics

D. Developed Web-based Predictive Application

Logistic Regression with Genetic Algorithm Feature
Selection as the model with the highest ACU, downloaded
as a .pkl file and was loaded to the views.py of Django
Framework. The developed web application has two ways
to perform a prediction. The first approach is predicting by
bulk using a CSV preprocessed dataset. The CSV file must
already undergo preprocessed methods as described in the
prior sections. However, the dataset must be added with
a new column labeled as an ID number to identify which
student needs the intervention. Figure 3 shows the interface
of prediction by bulk approach. The ‘choose file’ file allows
opening a computer directory to locate the dataset as input.
Afterward, the ‘predict’ button must be clicked for the web
application to start its prediction.

Figure 5. Form for Predicting a Student

The message pops-up interface was created using
sweet.js. When the model returns a value of 1, the message
box will appear, as shown in Figure 6. The returned value
‘1’ signifies that the student can graduate on time according
to the model.

Figure 3. Upload CSV dataset

Once the prediction is made,

the prediction will be
displayed at the lower portion of the web application body,
as shown in Figure 4. Two columns are presented, namely
‘ID Number’ and its prediction. The red text indicates the
need for intervention for a specific student. In contrast,
green text were students predicted to finish their program
within four (4) years.

Figure 6. ’Can Graduate on Time’ Message Prompt

On the other hand, the ‘Needs Intervention’ prompt will
appear once the prediction value is ‘0’ shown in Figure 7,
meaning the student probably will not graduate on time
based on his/her data.

Figure 4. Bulk Prediction Result

Figure 7. ’Needs Intervention’ Message Prompt

Another way to perform a prediction in the system is by
providing individual data. Figure 5 shows the user interface.
Each field has a designated value and will not allow
empty inputs to prevent missing values. Once everything
is filled in, the ‘submit’ button must be clicked to perform
prediction. Finally, a pop-up window will appear, prompting
whether it needs an intervention, as shown in Figures 6
and 7.

E. Implication

This study contributed new insight into the prediction
domain by presenting a real-world problem in the educa-
tion sector. The significant implication of this work can
help the university craft or improve existing policy, thus
positively affecting admission procedures—implementing
a more holistic approach for a more efficient selection

process. Lastly, for students, it could add guidance regarding
career path selection after their senior high school. While
the study focused on college students, these implications
are relevant to any school and institute as the baseline in
constructing admission plans, selection procedures, inter-
ventions, and student assessment. Moreover, these infer-
ences are significant to practitioners in the field of predictive
analytics and the like.

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The study found that the Genetic Algorithm outper-
formed NFS, L1, and L2 feature selection in seven algo-
rithms except for precisions of NFS’ random forest, the
accuracy rate of L2 using Na¨ıve Bayes, and precisions of
L2’s KNN and Na¨ıve Bayes. Among the features selected,
admission result is the most selected feature compared to
GPA, which was found to be second and equivalent sub-
stantial with sex, mother income, english, and math score.
In contrast, the abstract score least selected featured fol-
lowed by age, generation, and father income and attainment
based on their average occurrences in the feature selec-
tions employed. Logistic Regression with genetic Algorithm
as a feature selection method has the highest accuracy
(79%) and AUC score (71%) among others; thus, it was
selected as the best-performing predictive model. More-
over, it selected sex, mother income, grade point average,
admission result, english and math exam scores. Also, it
selected some portion of binary encoded features program,
status, generation, religion, municipality, province, father
occupation, father attainment, mother occupation, mother
attainment, and shstrack. Further studies are recommended
to continuously monitor the model’s correctness, such as
gathering the data of new entrants from 2019 and beyond,
serving as the validation dataset to assess the implemented
web application using the developed model. In addition,
since the study is dependent on the available data in the
in features to feed into the
university,
model. It is recommended to explore other predictors such
as internet connection, social media activity, hobbies, and
peer influence in future work as it may affect student success
to graduate.

Abstract

Credit risk prediction is central to financial stability and regulatory compliance, guiding
lending decisions and portfolio risk management. While traditional approaches such as
logistic regression and tree-based models have long been the industry standard, recent
advances in deep learning (DL) have introduced architectures capable of capturing complex
nonlinearities, temporal dynamics, and relational dependencies in borrower data. This
study provides a comprehensive review of DL methods applied to credit risk prediction,
covering multi-layer perceptron, recurrent and convolutional neural networks, transformer,
and graph neural networks. We examine benchmark and large-scale datasets, highlight
peer-reviewed applications across corporate, consumer, and peer-to-peer lending, and
evaluate the benefits of DL relative to classical machine learning. In addition, we critically
assess key challenges and identify emerging opportunities. By synthesising methods,
applications, and open challenges, this paper offers a roadmap for advancing trustworthy
deep learning in credit risk modelling and bridging the gap between academic research
and industry deployment.

1. Introduction

Credit risk prediction is a fundamental component of financial risk management,
enabling institutions to evaluate the likelihood of borrower default and to make informed
lending decisions [1–3]. Accurate modelling of credit risk supports financial stability,
reduces loan losses, and contributes to regulatory compliance. Traditionally, logistic regres-
sion (LR) has been the dominant model in credit scoring due to its simplicity, interpretability,
and ease of deployment in regulated environments [4]. However, as financial datasets have
grown in size and complexity, conventional LR models have struggled to capture nonlinear
relationships and interactions among features. This limitation has motivated the adoption
of more advanced machine learning (ML) methods such as random forests, support vector
machines (SVMs), and gradient boosting, which often achieve higher predictive accuracy
but at the expense of interpretability [5–7].

Deep learning has broadened credit risk modelling by enabling representation learning
on borrower data that is nonlinear, time-dependent, and sometimes networked. Recent
work explores feed-forward tabular networks, sequence models, attention-based trans-
formers, and graph neural networks to capture signals that are difficult to express in
conventional scorecards [8–10].

Alongside these methodological developments, a growing body of survey work has
reviewed credit risk models and related financial risk applications, as summarised in
Table 1. Early systematic reviews by Bhatore et al. [11], Shi et al. [12], Noriega et al. [13], and
Montevechi et al. [14] focus on ML-based credit scoring, synthesising algorithms, datasets,
and evaluation metrics but treating deep neural networks largely as one model family
among many. Other reviews concentrate on specific perspectives: Kim et al. [15] and Çallı
and Co¸skun [16] examine corporate default prediction and long-run default predictors,
while Mhlanga [17] discusses ML- and AI-enabled credit assessment in the context of
financial inclusion. Deep learning-centred surveys, such as Hayashi [18], Peng and Yan [19],
Hoyos et al. [20], and Demma et al. [21], identify emerging DL techniques for credit scoring
and broader financial risk, but mainly emphasise tabular models and do not systematically
cover sequential, transformer, and graph-based architectures for borrower-level credit risk.
Meanwhile, Mienye et al. [22] provided a broad overview of DL in financial services, yet its
treatment of credit risk was at a high-level. In short, much of the review literature either
prioritises broad ML coverage, narrows deep learning discussion to tabular scorecard-style
settings, or treats responsible AI topics without a model-family-level synthesis tailored to
borrower-level credit risk.

This study addresses that gap by organising modern deep learning methods for
borrower-level credit risk prediction, cataloguing recent peer-reviewed applications, and
synthesising deployment-relevant challenges and research opportunities. We focus on
borrower-, facility-, and firm-level settings where the objective is to estimate default-related
outcomes over a specified prediction horizon using application, behavioural, bureau, trans-
actional, textual, or relational data. The primary target is probability of default (PD) and
closely related delinquency outcomes. The reviewed evidence covers consumer lending,
SME lending, corporate credit, and peer-to-peer lending using both public benchmarks
and institution-scale datasets reported in peer-reviewed studies. We exclude work that
focuses on market or liquidity risk, portfolio optimisation without borrower-level labelling,
or purely methodological contributions that do not evaluate on an empirical credit-risk
task. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

• We present a unified overview of credit risk prediction tasks and benchmark datasets,
and trace the evolution from logistic regression to deep architectures, including MLPs,
CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and GNNs, highlighting how each class aligns with
different credit-risk objectives and data modalities.

• We provide a modality-aware synthesis of recent deep learning applications in credit
risk, organising studies by tabular, sequential, transformer-based, and graph-based
models, and collating their datasets, architectures, and reported performance.

• We critically analyse methodological and operational challenges for deploying DL-
based credit risk models and derive concrete research directions for developing trust-
worthy, regulation-ready deep learning solutions.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the review
methodology. Section 3 provides an overview of credit risk prediction tasks and commonly
used datasets. Section 4 traces the evolution from statistical to deep learning models,
detailing key architectures. Section 5 reviews peer-reviewed DL applications in credit
risk across data modalities. Section 6 presents a synthesis of major challenges and future
research directions. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2. Review Methodology

We conducted a structured literature search and screening exercise to assemble recent
peer-reviewed work on deep learning for borrower-level credit risk prediction. The goal
is a comprehensive and transparent narrative synthesis of the field rather than a formal
systematic review or meta-analysis.

To cover both computing and finance outlets, we searched IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM
Digital Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Web
of Science was included to broaden coverage of finance and operations research venues
that are not always well represented in engineering-focused indexes. Queries paired
credit-risk terms (e.g., credit scoring, default prediction, probability of default) with deep
learning terms (e.g., CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer, graph neural network). Where
supported, we restricted searches to title/abstract/keywords and refined query variants
iteratively using highly cited seed papers to limit irrelevant returns. We targeted journal
articles and full conference papers from 2015 to 2025, and added foundational earlier
studies via backward/forward citation tracking.

Search Strategy and Screening Protocol

The initial search identified approximately 380 records across all databases after merg-
ing results. Duplicate records were removed using title, author, venue, and year matching.
Following de-duplication and removal of clearly out-of-scope records, 208 studies were
retained for title and abstract screening, as summarised in Figure 1. The remaining studies
were screened in two stages: (i) title and abstract screening, followed by (ii) full-text assess-
ment. During title and abstract screening, studies were excluded if they focused exclusively
on market or liquidity risk, macroeconomic default modelling without borrower-level
prediction, or methodological deep learning contributions without an empirical credit risk
application. Full-text screening was then used to confirm relevance, extract methodological
details, and verify that the study addressed borrower-, facility-, or entity-level credit risk.

Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart of the literature search and screening process used in this survey. The
diagram summarises database querying, de-duplication, title and abstract screening, and full-text
eligibility assessment.

Studies were included if they satisfied at least one of the following criteria: (i) proposed
or empirically evaluated a deep learning architecture for credit risk prediction; (ii) provided
a survey or structured review of machine learning or deep learning methods for credit
risk; or (iii) addressed interpretability, fairness, robustness, or governance explicitly in a
credit risk context. Meanwhile, studies were excluded if they lacked quantitative evalu-
ation, provided insufficient methodological detail to assess the learning architecture, or
focused solely on regulatory or policy discussion without a modelling component. Unlike
systematic reviews, no strict performance-improvement threshold was imposed; how-
ever, studies were required to report at least one standard evaluation metric to support
empirical comparison.

The final corpus comprises 140 deep learning application studies and 18 survey or
guideline papers. For each included study, we recorded the data modality (tabular, sequen-
tial, textual, or relational), model architecture (MLP, CNN, RNN/LSTM/GRU, Transformer,
GNN, or hybrid), credit product segment (consumer, SME, corporate, interbank, or mixed),
prediction target, and reported evaluation metrics. We did not apply a formal risk-of-bias
scoring protocol (given the non-systematic scope and heterogeneous study designs), but we
extracted reporting attributes relevant to interpretability, validation design (e.g., out-of-time
vs random splits), and deployment considerations where available. These attributes under-
pin the taxonomy used in Sections 4 and 5, and the related survey literature is summarised
in Table 1.

3. Overview of Credit Risk Prediction and Datasets

Credit risk refers to the potential loss that a lender or investor faces when a borrower
fails to meet contractual financial obligations [17]. Accurate credit risk prediction is funda-
mental to financial stability, guiding capital allocation, pricing, and provisioning decisions
under regulatory frameworks such as Basel III. Traditionally, credit risk has been assessed
through statistical scorecards and expert judgment; however, the rise of data-driven lending
and digital credit platforms has produced large-scale, high-dimensional borrower data
that demand more advanced modelling approaches. This section provides an overview of
the key predictive tasks in credit risk management and summarises benchmark datasets
commonly employed in empirical studies.

3.1. Credit Risk Prediction Tasks

Credit risk prediction aims to estimate the likelihood and magnitude of potential
losses associated with lending activities. In regulatory and research practice, three main
quantitative tasks are typically addressed:

•

•

•

Probability of Default: The likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet contractual
repayment obligations within a specified horizon. PD modelling forms the foundation
of most credit scoring systems and risk-based pricing frameworks [28].
Loss Given Default (LGD): The proportion of the exposure that is not recovered in the
event of default, reflecting collateral values, recovery processes, and legal costs [29].
Exposure at Default (EAD): The total outstanding amount a lender is exposed to when
default occurs, which is particularly important for revolving facilities such as credit
cards and overdrafts [30].

Across the reviewed literature, PD-style targets (default or closely related delinquency
outcomes) dominate, and they form the primary basis for comparing deep learning model
families in this survey. Prediction horizons and label definitions vary across studies and
products; where reported, we capture these details in the study summaries to support
consistent interpretation. LGD and EAD are discussed only in studies that explicitly
model them using deep architectures, reflecting their comparatively limited coverage in
the deep learning credit-risk literature. These quantities determine the Expected Loss (EL),
a cornerstone of risk-weighted asset (RWA) calculation in Basel frameworks, defined as:

EL = PD × LGD × EAD.

(1)

Though EL is crucial in credit risk, it is inconsistently reported and is not comparable
across heterogeneous datasets and horizons in the surveyed studies. Accordingly, the
synthesis in Section 5 focuses on the evaluation metrics most commonly reported for
PD-style prediction.

3.2. Benchmark Datasets

Empirical research on credit risk frequently relies on benchmark datasets to evaluate
and compare modelling approaches. The most widely used public datasets include the
German Credit, Australian Credit, and Taiwan Credit Card Default datasets, which have
become standard baselines for ML algorithms. The German Credit dataset, compiled by
the UCI ML Repository, contains 1000 loan applicants with 20 demographic and financial
attributes labeled as good or bad credit risk [31]. The Australian Credit dataset is smaller,
comprising 690 records with mixed categorical and numerical features for binary credit-
worthiness classification. The Taiwan Credit Card Default dataset is substantially larger,
featuring 30,000 clients with detailed billing, repayment, and demographic information,
and is widely used in deep learning benchmarks [32].

While these datasets facilitate reproducibility and algorithmic comparison, their lim-
ited sample sizes, static structures, and lack of temporal or behavioural features constrain
generalisability to real-world portfolios [33]. Small benchmarks also create high-variance
evaluation regimes in which apparent performance differences are unstable and can be
driven by a few influential cases rather than a durable risk signal. For example, with
only 1000 observations, the German Credit dataset can yield materially different estimates
across random splits, and high-capacity models may overfit idiosyncratic correlations that
do not transfer to new borrower cohorts. This effect is compounded by sample-selection
mechanisms that are absent or unobserved in public benchmarks (e.g., lender acceptance
policies and underwriting rules), meaning the observed labels may reflect a filtered sub-
population rather than the full applicant pool. Consequently, models trained and reported
on such datasets often overestimate out-of-sample performance and understate uncertainty
in comparative claims.

To address these shortcomings, contemporary studies increasingly adopt larger and
more heterogeneous datasets. For example, the Home Credit Default Risk dataset [34]
includes over 300,000 loan applications enriched with demographic, behavioural, and
bureau records, representing a closer approximation to industrial settings. Similarly, the
Lending Club peer-to-peer lending dataset contains millions of transactions and repayment
records, enabling large-scale evaluations of ensemble and deep learning models [35].

Despite these advances, much of the academic literature continues to rely on small,
static benchmarks that fail to capture macroeconomic shifts and dynamic borrower be-
haviour. Bridging this gap requires longitudinal, multimodal datasets with explicit time
structure and stable label definitions, so that models can be evaluated under out-of-time val-
idation and assessed for drift, calibration decay, and subgroup performance. Such datasets
are essential for benchmarking emerging deep learning architectures under realistic and
regulatory-compliant conditions (Table 2).

4. Evolution of Models for Credit Risk

Credit risk modelling has progressed from interpretable linear methods to deep archi-
tectures that capture nonlinear interactions, sequential behaviour, and relational dependen-
cies among borrowers. This section reviews the methodological evolution across the main
model families.

4.1. Logistic Regression and Classical Machine Learning

Logistic regression (LR) remains the cornerstone of credit scoring due to its trans-
parency and regulatory acceptance [36,37]. Given input features x ∈ Rd and parameters
(w, b), LR models the probability of default as:

P(y = 1 | x) = σ(w⊤x + b) =

1
1 + exp(−w⊤x − b)

,

(2)

where σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid and y ∈ {0, 1} denotes default status. Despite its sim-
plicity, LR assumes a linear log-odds relationship, limiting its ability to capture nonlinear
feature effects and interactions in high-dimensional data. Subsequent classical ML models,
such as support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting, enhanced flexibil-
ity by learning nonlinear decision boundaries. These methods typically outperform LR in
accuracy but at the cost of interpretability, motivating subsequent research into models that
balance both properties [5].

4.2. Early Deep Learning for Tabular Credit Risk

The introduction of deep learning brought neural architectures capable of learning
complex, nonlinear transformations directly from tabular credit data. Unlike traditional
logistic regression (LR), which models linear relationships, deep neural networks can
capture hierarchical feature interactions through multiple hidden layers. A multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), illustrated in Figure 2, extends LR by stacking hidden layers with
nonlinear activations that enable the automatic extraction of latent feature representations.
Mathematically, the forward propagation in an MLP is given by:

h(l) = ϕ(W(l)h(l−1) + b(l)),

(3)

where ϕ(·) denotes a nonlinear activation function such as ReLU. This hierarchical structure
allows MLPs to approximate complex functions on large datasets, thereby uncovering
nonlinear relationships between borrower characteristics and default probabilities [38].

Figure 2. Basic structure of a feed-forward neural network used for tabular credit data. The network
consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers with nonlinear activations, and an output layer
for default prediction.

4.3. Sequential and Temporal Behaviour Modelling

Creditworthiness evolves over time as borrowers make repayments, accumulate bal-
ances, adjust spending behaviour, or experience income fluctuations. Sequential neural
networks explicitly model these behavioural trajectories by capturing temporal dependen-
cies that static models cannot. These architectures process credit-related sequences—such
as monthly repayment histories, rolling utilisation rates, or delinquency transitions—in a
step-wise manner, enabling the extraction of long-range behavioural patterns. Recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) form the foundation for sequential modelling. At each time step t,
an RNN updates its hidden state according to

ht = tanh(Whht−1 + Wxxt + b),

(4)

where xt is the input vector at time t, ht is the hidden state, Wh and Wx are learnable weight
matrices, and b is a bias term. Although RNNs can capture short-term temporal structure,
they struggle with long-range dependencies due to vanishing gradients [39].

4.3.1. Long Short-Term Memory Networks

To address the limitations of standard RNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM) net-
works introduce gating mechanisms that regulate information flow and preserve long-term
temporal patterns. The LSTM architecture (Figure 3) uses three gates—forget, input, and
output—to update an internal memory cell Ct:

ft = σ(Wf [ht−1, xt] + b f ),
it = σ(Wi[ht−1, xt] + bi),
˜Ct = tanh(Wc[ht−1, xt] + bc),
Ct = ft ⊙ Ct−1 + it ⊙ ˜Ct,
ot = σ(Wo[ht−1, xt] + bo),

ht = ot ⊙ tanh(Ct),

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

Here, the hidden state and cell state are denoted by ht and Ct, respectively, and xt is the
input vector at time step t. The gates ft, it, and ot control forgetting, updating, and output,
while ˜Ct denotes the candidate cell update. σ(·) is the sigmoid activation function and ⊙
denotes elementwise multiplication [40].

output regulation.

4.3.2. Gated Recurrent Unit Networks

The gated recurrent unit (GRU), illustrated in Figure 4, simplifies the LSTM architec-
ture by using a single state variable and two gates. GRUs compute their hidden state using:

zt = σ(Wz[ht−1, xt] + bz),
rt = σ(Wr[ht−1, xt] + br),
˜ht = tanh(Wh[rt ⊙ ht−1, xt] + bh),
ht = (1 − zt) ⊙ ht−1 + zt ⊙ ˜ht,

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where xt is the input vector at time step t and ht is the GRU hidden state. The vectors zt and
rt denote the update and reset gates, respectively, and ˜ht is the candidate hidden state [39].

Figure 4. Architecture of the GRU network, highlighting the update and reset gates that control
information flow across time steps.

4.3.3. Temporal Convolutional Networks

Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) offer an alternative to recurrent architectures
by applying one-dimensional dilated convolutions to capture long-range dependencies
without recursion:

ht =

K−1
∑
k=0

Wk xt−d·k,

(14)

where d denotes the dilation factor and K the kernel size [41]. Unlike RNNs and LSTMs,
TCNs process sequences in parallel, preserving causality through zero-padding while
enabling efficient training on long temporal windows [42,43]. This property makes TCNs
particularly valuable for high-frequency repayment data and real-time transaction streams
where parallel computation and long-horizon forecasting are advantageous.

4.4. Convolutional and Hybrid Architectures

CNNs, though historically associated with image processing, have become effective
tools for modelling structured financial sequences [44]. In credit risk, one-dimensional
convolutions slide learnable filters over borrower histories—capturing local temporal pat-
terns such as consecutive delinquencies, abrupt utilisation jumps, or irregular repayment
intervals. These filters extract short-range behavioural motifs while sharing parameters
across time steps, yielding models that are both computationally efficient and less prone

https://doi.org/10.3390/info17040395

Information 2026, 17, 395

10 of 28

to overfitting than dense architectures. Figure 5 illustrates this structure, where con-
volutional and pooling layers form hierarchical representations of borrower behaviour
before classification.

Figure 5. Basic CNN architecture adapted for one-dimensional financial sequences. Convolutional
and pooling layers capture local repayment or utilisation patterns, which are then passed to dense
layers for classification.

Several studies report that CNN-based sequence encoders are competitive with re-
current architectures in credit-risk sequence modelling when local behavioural patterns
dominate the signal, while offering faster training due to parallelism [44,45]. Their par-
allelism offers significant speed advantages for large portfolios, and their stable train-
ing dynamics make them well suited for industrial settings where rapid retraining and
consistent convergence are required. This has motivated hybrid credit-risk models that
integrate CNN modules with other deep architectures. Wide–deep networks combine
a linear branch—reflecting scorecard-style interpretability—with nonlinear deep compo-
nents that capture higher-order interactions. Other hybrids, such as CNN–LSTM and
CNN–Transformer models, leverage convolutions to encode short-term behaviour before
passing features to recurrent or attention-based layers to capture long-range dependen-
cies. These designs offer a practical balance between interpretability, expressive capac-
ity, and computational scalability, making them increasingly relevant in modern credit
risk pipelines.

4.5. Transformer

Transformer architectures introduce a fundamentally different approach to modelling
sequence and tabular credit data by replacing recurrence with self-attention, enabling the
capture of global dependencies in parallel rather than stepwise [46]. Instead of processing
borrower histories chronologically, as RNNs do, the transformer computes pairwise inter-
actions across all feature dimensions or time steps simultaneously. The core self-attention
mechanism is defined as:

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

V,

QK⊤
√
dk

(15)

https://doi.org/10.3390/info17040395

Information 2026, 17, 395

11 of 28

where Q, K, and V denote the query, key, and value matrices representing latent projections
of input features or time steps, and dk is a scaling constant to stabilise gradients. This
formulation enables the model to assign adaptive relevance weights across the entire
behavioural sequence, allowing it to capture long-range delinquency signatures, cyclical
utilisation trends, and cross-feature interactions that traditional recurrent networks struggle
to retain.

Recent adaptations demonstrate how transformers can be repurposed from natural
language processing to structured financial learning. TabTransformer [47] contextualises
categorical embeddings, improving discrimination on tabular credit datasets with high-
cardinality socio-economic attributes.

4.6. Graph Neural Networks

Borrowers often participate in interdependent financial ecosystems through co-
applicant ties, shared employers, guarantor structures, fund-flow relationships, or supply-
chain linkages. These relational patterns give rise to correlated credit exposures and
potential contagion pathways that cannot be represented in i.i.d. tabular data. Graph
neural networks (GNNs) model such relational dependencies via iterative message passing,
where each node updates its representation by aggregating transformed messages from
neighbouring nodes. The generic update rule for a message-passing layer is expressed as


 ∑

= σ

(l+1)
v

h

u∈N (v)



W(l)h

(l)
u

,

1
cvu

(16)

(l)
v

is the embedding of borrower v at layer l, N (v) denotes neighbouring nodes (e.g.,
where h
borrowers, firms, accounts, or counterparties connected through ownership, transactions,
or contractual ties), cvu is a normalisation coefficient (e.g., node degree), W(l) is a learnable
weight transform, and σ(·) is a nonlinear activation. Figure 6 visualises this pipeline:
neighbours send learned messages, the messages are pooled, and the central borrower
embedding is updated to reflect relational credit risk factors.

representations are collected, aggregated, and used to update each node, enabling propagation of
financial influence signals.

5. Notable DL Applications in Peer-Reviewed Credit Risk Studies

This section synthesises peer-reviewed applications of deep learning to credit risk. We
map empirical studies to the same three axes: modality, architecture, and objective, and
report the evaluation metrics they used and the quantitative performance obtained.

5.1. Tabular Deep Networks for Credit Risk

Deep learning for tabular borrower data has evolved from simple multilayer per-
ceptrons (MLPs) to specialised architectures that leverage regularisation, attention, em-
beddings, and hybrid ensembling. This subsection reviews representative studies that
apply deep tabular models to corporate, retail, and institutional lending data, highlighting
methodological contributions, empirical findings, and comparative performance relative to
conventional ML models.

Yang et al. [48] proposed a high-dimensional deep neural network (HDNN) for corpo-
rate credit risk using supply-chain augmented financial data. Their model incorporated
combined L1–L2 penalties to address feature sparsity and batch-normalisation effects,
achieving an accuracy of 80.12%, outperforming logistic regression (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.717), support vector machines (AUC = 0.738), and
a standard neural network baseline (AUC = 0.692). Lin et al. [49] introduced a penalised
deep neural network (PDNN) based on survival modelling, embedding a one-to-one pe-
nalisation layer that supported variable selection alongside time-to-default estimation on
peer-to-peer lending data, consistently outperforming non-penalised deep variants.

Recent studies have further examined interpretability and profit-aware optimisation
within deep tabular learning. Asencios et al. [50] compared MLP, XGBoost, and TabNet
on 36,402 Peruvian cooperative-lending applications using regression-based profit scor-
ing. XGBoost achieved the best results (R2 = 0.7906), although TabNet (R2 = 0.7465)
offered more transparent feature-level interpretability through attentive embeddings. In
large-scale settings, Wang and Zhang [51] proposed a TabNet-Stacking ensemble that inte-

Information 2026, 17, 395

grated TabNet, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, SVM, and KNN, reaching accuracy = 0.979,
recall = 0.856, F1 = 0.817, and AUC = 0.941 on the Tianchi dataset (≈800,000 cases), sub-
stantially outperforming single-model baselines.

Beyond architecture design, explainability has become central to tabular deep learning
deployment. Hjelkrem and de Lange [52] trained an MLP using open banking transac-
tion data and compared it with a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
(BERT)-based model, reporting that the MLP achieved superior predictive performance
while maintaining practical explainability using SHAP attribution visualisations. Their
results showed that SHAP detected intuitive behavioural risk factors, supporting suitability
for regulated financial settings. Li et al. [53] introduced an incremental DNN (I-DNN) for
borrower credit scoring on agricultural microloan records (22,475 examples), demonstrat-
ing AUC improvements ranging between 1.4% and 7.8% compared with standard DNN,
XGBoost, and random forest baselines under concept drift scenarios.

Advances in deep tabular modelling have also explored ensemble-driven generalisa-
tion. Popov et al. [54] introduced Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), replacing
discrete tree splits with differentiable soft-gating, producing competitive performance
with gradient boosting while enhancing differentiability and calibration under stochastic
optimisation. Building on ensemble reasoning, Shan and Gao [55] proposed an enhanced
TabNet stacking model for SME supply-chain financial risk prediction using multi-stage
optimisation, achieving AUC = 0.9616 and Accuracy = 0.9277, outperforming standard
TabNet, LightGBM, and CatBoost baselines.

These works demonstrate that tabular DL has advanced from simple feed-forward net-
works toward architectures that integrate regularization, attention, and ensemble learning.
Overall, these studies suggest that deep tabular models are often competitive with strong
tree-based ensembles on larger datasets, particularly when the feature space includes
high-cardinality categorical variables, complex interactions, or multimodal extensions
that benefit from representation learning. On smaller benchmarks, reported gains are
frequently modest and can be sensitive to split design and tuning, meaning gradient
boosting remains a strong and frequently hard-to-beat baseline. Deep networks therefore
complement rather than replace classical methods, with their main advantage arising when
data scale, heterogeneity, or unified multimodal pipelines justify the added modelling and
operational complexity.

5.2. Sequential Models and Event–Time Targets

Sequential deep learning approaches model the evolution of borrower or portfolio
behaviour over time, offering substantial advantages over static classifiers that ignore
risk trajectories. These models capture temporal patterns linked to repayment behaviour,
behavioural drifts, cyclical spending, macroeconomic shocks, and post-origination delin-
quency paths. Compared with conventional panel regression and tree-based models,
sequential architectures integrate information across ordered observations and enable
dynamic probability-of-default estimation rather than static, single-point predictions.

Liang and Cai [56] applied long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to forecast
monthly default rates on the Lending Club peer-to-peer platform. The LSTM consistently
outperformed ARIMA, SVM, and ANN across multiple cross-validation schemes, reducing
MAE from 0.095 to 0.072 and RMSE from 0.119 to 0.093. Further support for recurrent
credit modelling appears in Ala’raj et al. [57], who developed two behavioural LSTM
variants (MP–LSTM and PE–LSTM) for real retail banking credit card customers. Their
models surpassed SVM, RF, MLP, and LR baselines across predictive and calibration metrics,
demonstrating that temporal representation learning enhances behavioural default scoring
in operational settings.

Information 2026, 17, 395

Beyond standard LSTMs, hybrid deep temporal architectures have gained promi-
nence. Zhang [58] proposed a CNN–LSTM attention model for enterprise credit risk,
achieving AUC = 0.92 and F1 = 0.91, outperforming CNN- and LSTM-only baselines.
Li et al. [59] extended this approach for listed corporate risk and reported that CNN layers
effectively extract short-term temporal motifs, while LSTM components encode longer be-
havioural transitions, confirming that hierarchical temporal modelling improves enterprise
credit discrimination.

Survival-driven architectures further generalise temporal credit modelling by estimat-
ing hazard rather than static outcomes. Wang et al. [60] implemented a deep discrete-time
survival model that decomposes credit outcomes into age, period, and cohort dimensions,
generating interpretable hazard curves with a smoother temporal structure than classical
econometric approaches. Chen and Long [61] similarly advanced temporal modelling
through a self-attention-based end-to-end corporate credit rating framework, which re-
moved the need for manual feature aggregation and improved rating classification stability
relative to traditional ML competitors.

More recent developments incorporate fusion and cross-feature interaction within
sequential networks. Han et al. [62] introduced a default-prediction framework com-
bining self-attention with a cross-network mechanism, demonstrating that modelling
interactive temporal dependencies yields higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
relative to standard deep learning architectures. Shi et al. [63] also benchmarked CNN,
RNN, and DNN models in financial-sector credit scoring and observed that recurrent
architectures maintained superior temporal sensitivity, while CNNs provided parameter
efficiency benefits.

Bidirectional and residual-enhanced architectures have been explored to stabilise
recurrent training and preserve long-range gradients. Yang et al. [64] introduced a residual-
enhanced bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework incorporating multi-
head attention, achieving AUC = 0.982 and F1 = 0.958 on the Freddie Mac Single-Family
dataset, outperforming BiLSTM, GRU, CNN, and RNN baselines. Complementary research
explores coupling sequential encoders with probabilistic reasoning: Zhang [65] integrated
LSTM encoders with Bayesian calibration modules, achieving AUC = 0.981 and reducing
uncertainty miscalibration relative to RF and LR baselines.

These results indicate that sequential architectures are most valuable when lenders
possess rich post-origination histories or portfolio-level time series and care about how risk
evolves, not just whether a borrower eventually defaults. LSTM- and GRU-like models
offer clear gains for dynamic behavioural scoring and vintage-level forecasting, while
CNN–LSTM hybrids and survival-based networks help bridge the gap between point
predictions and time-to-event outcomes. However, the empirical lift over strong tabular
baselines tends to appear only when sequences are sufficiently long and informative;
on static benchmarks with limited behavioural content, sequential models mainly add
complexity without delivering commensurate practical benefit.

5.3. Transformer-Based Models for Credit Risk

Transformers represent a major departure from recurrent architectures by replacing
sequential recurrence with self-attention, enabling parallel computation and global depen-
dency modelling across features, time steps, or modalities [46]. The key mechanism, scaled
dot-product attention, allows each element in a sequence or feature vector to condition on
all others, overcoming long-term dependency limitations typical of LSTMs and GRUs. This
property is attractive in credit modelling, where behavioural variables, categorical features,
and text-based signals interact in complex, non-local patterns.

Information 2026, 17, 395

Early adoption has focused on adapting the transformer encoder to tabular and be-
havioural credit data. Huang et al. [47] introduced the TabTransformer, demonstrating
performance gains on high-cardinality categorical financial datasets by replacing conven-
tional one-hot encodings with contextual embeddings. Gorishniy et al. [66] later improved
architectural efficiency with the FT-Transformer, showing that attention-based tabular
models can be competitive with strong tree-ensemble baselines such as CatBoost and XG-
Boost on several tabular tasks, particularly when feature interactions are complex and
heterogeneously distributed. Wang and Xiao [67] extended this paradigm by embedding
behavioural sequences alongside static features, achieving AUC = 0.72 and KS = 0.32 on an
online lending dataset, outperforming both LSTM and XGBoost baselines.

Recent work has started to specialise transformer architectures for different segments
of the credit market. Korangi et al. [68] framed mid-cap corporate default prediction as
a multi-label panel classification task, using a transformer to learn the term structure of
default probabilities over horizons from a few months to three years. Their multi-channel
design ingests accounting, pricing, and market variables and applies a task-specific loss for
multi-horizon default prediction, yielding sizeable AUC improvements over traditional
statistical and LSTM-based benchmarks. Li et al. [69] proposed HFTCRNet, a hierarchical
fusion transformer for interbank credit rating and systemic risk assessment. The model
combines a long-term temporal transformer for bank growth trajectories, a short-term
cross-graph transformer for dynamic interbank exposures, and an attentive contagion
module, trained in a semi-supervised fashion using both credit ratings and SRISK labels.
On a dataset of 4548 banks with quarterly balance sheets and network data, HFTCRNet
outperformed deep and non-deep baselines in rating accuracy while also capturing systemic
risk patterns in the interbank network.

In the retail and SME space, transformer-based models have been applied to both
tabular and sequential credit signals. Kakadiya et al. [70] investigated transformer archi-
tectures for bank loan default prediction and reported performance gains over logistic
regression and tree-based methods, arguing that self-attention captures higher-order de-
pendencies among financial variables that are missed by conventional models. Zhang and
Liang [71] proposed a minimum weighted value error combination model that integrates a
BERT-based transformer for temporal features with DNN and MLP components for static,
non-sequential attributes. Features are first selected using chi-square tests and gradient
boosting decision trees, and the final prediction is obtained by dynamically weighting the
sequence and non-sequence experts according to an improved minimum weighted error
criterion. Experiments on personal credit data showed that the combined model achieves
higher classification accuracy than any individual transformer or feed-forward baseline.

Addressing class imbalance and transparency, Hartomo et al. [72] introduced a
weighted-loss TabTransformer with integrated explainable AI for MSME and consumer
credit datasets. Using cost-sensitive weighting, their model improved accuracy on the BI-
SAID and German Credit datasets from 86.35% to 89.27% and from 93% to 95%, respectively,
while also boosting minority-class AUC and precision–recall. SHAP-based explanations
highlighted economically meaningful drivers such as financing needs and credit amount,
illustrating how attention-based tabular models can be combined with explainable AI
(XAI) to support more accountable decision-making. Wu [73] developed a BiLSTM-fused
transformer for enterprise financial risk identification within a blockchain-based financial
sharing platform. The model jointly processes textual and visual financial information to
classify firms into five risk levels and, in experiments, achieved risk identification accuracy
above 94% with AUC exceeding 0.95, outperforming baseline RNNs while operating on
securely shared financial records.

Textual transformers have also gained prominence where loan assessments, credit
memos, and SME narratives remain human-authored. Stevenson et al. [74] showed that
BERT-derived embeddings from lender-written documents produced competitive default
prediction results without structured data. Lu et al. [75] extended BERT embeddings
into a hybrid architecture with residual blocks to fuse textual and numeric signals for
corporate credit. This trend aligns with regulatory interest in leveraging unstructured and
semi-structured disclosures rather than purely tabular indicators.

A frontier research area involves transformer robustness, adversarial safety, and
regulatory alignment. Schwab and Kriebel [76] demonstrated that transformer encoders
can be sensitive to adversarial perturbations and proposed gradient-based regularisation
defenses. Given that financial systems are highly sensitive to stability and fairness, future
deployments of transformers must incorporate calibration diagnostics, imbalance-aware
loss functions, explainability tooling, and context-aware adversarial safeguards.

The recent contributions indicate that transformers are moving from experimental
architectures to practical candidates for large-scale, multimodal, and system-level credit risk
models. Their main advantage lies not only in predictive lift but also in their ability to unify
behavioural sequences, categorical embeddings, textual narratives, interbank networks,
and graph-structured relationships within a single modelling interface, while increasingly
accommodating class imbalance, interpretability, and systemic risk considerations.

The emerging evidence suggests that transformers are most promising in settings
where credit risk depends on high-dimensional, heterogeneous, or multimodal signals
that interact in non-local ways. Self-attention is particularly effective when modelling the
joint influence of long repayment histories, bureau or transactional text, and rich categor-
ical attributes, and it enables a single architecture to operate across these modalities. At
the same time, transformers typically require larger training datasets, more parameters,
and longer training times than conventional models, and the number of truly large-scale,
production-grade credit studies is still small. In practice, they should be viewed as candi-
dates for portfolios with abundant data and complex interactions, rather than as drop-in
replacements for tree ensembles or recurrent networks on small tabular datasets.

5.4. Graph Neural Networks for Relational Credit Risk

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for credit risk predic-
tion due to their ability to encode relational dependencies that conventional tabular and
sequential models ignore. Borrowers interact within rich financial ecosystems involving
co-application, ownership links, shared directorship, supplier–customer contracts, and
transaction flows, making relational learning a natural extension to deep credit scoring.
Unlike feed-forward or recurrent architectures that assume independent records, GNNs
perform iterative message passing, enabling representation learning that captures both
direct and indirect risk propagation across financial networks.

Wang et al. [77] construct small and medium enterprise (SME) relational graphs using
shared director and business-interaction information and apply a relational graph attention
network (RGAT) for default prediction. Their inductive testing protocol shows that graph
baselines such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), and
relational GCN (RGCN) outperform non-graph models, with RGAT achieving AUC = 0.797
and KS = 0.457, while a multi-head extension reaches AUC = 0.799 and KS = 0.528. The
results demonstrate that relational signals remain predictive even without transactional
features. Similarly, Song et al. [78] proposed the multi-structure cascaded GNN (MS-
CGNN), integrating pairwise graphs with heterogeneous hypergraph structures to model
higher-order interactions. The method achieved Recall = 0.8863, Accuracy = 0.9442, and

https://doi.org/10.3390/info17040395

Information 2026, 17, 395

17 of 28

F1-score = 0.9300, outperforming several GNN baselines and confirming that multi-level
topology strengthens risk representation.

Temporal and behavioural dynamics have also been incorporated into graph mod-
elling. Yuan et al. [79] introduce DGNN-SR, which fuses static fund-transfer graphs with
dynamic user–merchant payment graphs using multi-view time encoders. Experiments on
Tencent datasets containing more than 2.8M nodes and 200M edges show AUC improve-
ments between 0.85% and 2.5% over the best continuous-time GNN baselines. From a
supply-chain financing perspective, Mojdehi et al. [80] combine topological data analysis
with GNNs (BM–GNN), attaining maximum accuracy of 93.56% across multiple scenarios
while consistently outperforming classical ML models in stability and robustness, despite
similar point-estimate accuracy on some subsets.

Recent work has emphasised higher-order graph structures, regulatory alignment,
and training stability. Wang et al. [81] proposed a motif-preserving GNN with curricu-
lum learning to capture subgraph patterns frequently observed in enterprise networks,
demonstrating improved performance across one public and two industrial datasets. The
curriculum design helped mitigate convergence instability arising from noisy relational
substructures. In another direction, Liu et al. [82] constructed enterprise credit graphs using
a maximum spanning tree derived from 29 financial indicators and applied GraphSAGE
to multi-level credit grading. Their results confirmed higher ROC values than tree-based
and neural baselines, despite using a sparse graph, highlighting the value of relational
inductive bias even in limited-connectivity settings.

Scalability has become a core evaluation criterion for real-world deployment. Zhang
et al. [83] developed a large-scale industrial GNN pipeline comprising 23.4M nodes
for supply-chain mining and 8.6M nodes for default prediction. Their model achieved
AUC = 0.995 on supply-chain tie mining and 0.701 on loan-default prediction, outper-
forming static graph-learning competitors and demonstrating that GNNs can operate at
web-scale for national credit infrastructure. Furthermore, Cheng and Luo [84] propose a
metapath-driven risk contagion GNN (RCGNN) using heterogeneous paths (investment,
geography, and industry), reporting superior performance to homogeneous GNNs for
enterprise credit classification, although detailed metrics were not published.

Overall, GNN-based credit models are most compelling when relational structure is
intrinsic to the risk problem, such as SME supply chains, interbank exposures, enterprise
ownership networks, or fund-transfer graphs. In these environments, message passing
captures contagion and correlated risk that tabular or sequential models are structurally
unable to represent, and the empirical studies show consistent gains in discrimination
and stability under sparse or noisy features. The trade-off is engineering complexity:
constructing, maintaining, and governing large-scale financial graphs is non-trivial, and
the marginal benefit of GNNs is limited when relational information is weak or unavailable.
Consequently, GNNs are best viewed as targeted tools for systemically interconnected
portfolios rather than as universal replacements for borrower-level scorecards.

Table 4 consolidates the peer-reviewed deep learning applications discussed in this
section, grouped by model family for readability and direct linkage to the preceding
subsections. Reported metrics and values are reproduced as stated in the source studies

6. Challenges, Limitations, and Future Research Directions

Deep learning can improve risk discrimination, but deploying such models in reg-
ulated credit environments introduces constraints that go beyond accuracy. This section
summarises the main challenges and then distils research directions aimed at trustworthy,
regulation-ready credit risk modelling.

6.1. Challenges and Limitations
6.1.1. Evaluation Integrity

Credit risk evolves over time in response to behavioural, policy, and macroeconomic
shifts, making random k-fold cross-validation prone to temporal leakage. When observa-
tions from later periods appear in both training and test folds, performance estimates can
implicitly rely on future information that would not be available at decision time. Time-
ordered evaluation schemes, including out-of-time splits and rolling-origin validation in
which the training window strictly precedes the evaluation window, provide a more faith-
ful estimate of deployment performance under regime change and stress conditions [85].
However, a non-trivial portion of deep credit risk studies still relies on random splits,
weakening external validity and complicating comparisons across model families.

A second source of fragility is over-reliance on threshold-agnostic summary met-
rics such as AUC, which aggregate performance across all score cut-offs and can mask
behaviour in the operating region where lending decisions are actually made. In highly im-
balanced portfolios, complementary measures such as the area under the precision–recall
curve (AUPRC) and cost-sensitive metrics better reflect minority-class performance and
the economic consequences of misclassification [33]. Equally important, probability cal-
ibration is rarely assessed, despite being central to decisioning and risk quantification:
poorly calibrated scores can lead to unstable approval rates, mis-priced credit, and biased
downstream estimates of portfolio risk, even when ranking performance (AUC) improves.
Calibration-sensitive reporting using the Brier score and expected calibration error, together
with reliability diagrams, provides direct evidence of whether predicted probabilities match
observed default frequencies [86]. When miscalibration is detected, post hoc methods such
as Platt scaling, isotonic regression, and temperature scaling can improve alignment be-
tween predicted and empirical default rates [87], but these steps are seldom documented in
deep credit risk papers.

Finally, decision-facing evaluation should make explicit how metrics map to lend-
ing outcomes. For PD-style models, this includes reporting performance at operationally
relevant thresholds and, where inputs are available, quantifying utility using simple cost
proxies (false-approval loss versus false-rejection opportunity cost) or by propagating cali-
brated PD into downstream loss constructs (e.g., EL-style estimates), while acknowledging
that EL is not comparable across heterogeneous datasets and recovery definitions. These
considerations jointly form a de facto evaluation checklist for deployment-aligned credit
risk modelling.

6.1.2. Imbalanced Learning and Reject Inference

Default datasets are heavily imbalanced, and naïve resampling can distort temporal
and behavioural structure. Over-sampling techniques such as SMOTE are often applied
indiscriminately without temporal safeguards, while cost-sensitive learning better reflects
economic risk but is infrequently employed [88,89]. A further complication is reject infer-
ence: declined applicants lack observed outcomes, leading to structurally biased training
data and unreliable generalisation [28,90,91]. Observed outcomes are conditional on accep-
tance policies, leading to sample-selection bias that inflates apparent model performance

https://doi.org/10.3390/info17040395

Information 2026, 17, 395

when applied to rejected populations. Existing proxy-based inference methods remain
heuristic and are not aligned with regulatory transparency expectations.

6.1.3. Interpretability and Fairness

Although deep models improve predictive power, their opacity conflicts with reg-
ulatory explainability requirements. Post hoc explanation tools, including SHAP and
integrated gradients, may not provide stable, counterfactual-faithful explanations [92]. In
practice, the appropriate explanation tool depends on the model family and the decision
artefact being justified: for MLP-style tabular networks, feature attribution methods and
monotonic or sparse constraints can support reasoned factor narratives; for tree-like base-
lines and tree–neural hybrids, TreeSHAP-style decompositions often provide the most
auditable feature-level breakdown; for transformer-based credit models, attribution over
token/feature embeddings (with attention used as a supportive diagnostic rather than
a standalone explanation) is typically more reliable than raw attention maps; and for
GNN-based credit models, subgraph- or message-passing explanations can localise which
relations drive a risk score.

Fairness is also inconsistently operationalised in the DL credit-risk literature. Metrics
such as equalised odds [93] are rarely integrated into training objectives, despite evidence
that automated lending can amplify existing socio-economic inequalities. Fairness targets
are context dependent: demographic parity may be inappropriate when base rates differ
for legitimate reasons, whereas error-rate constraints such as equalised odds may be
more suitable when the aim is to control differential misclassification harms. Accordingly,
the selected fairness definition should be justified relative to the lending decision, the
attributes available for monitoring, and the governing legal regime, and it should be
assessed alongside model calibration and operating-threshold behaviour. Counterfactual
explanation approaches remain promising, but deployment at scale is often hindered by
feasibility constraints and by the need to ensure plausibility under real credit policy and
data-generating processes [94].

Among the surveyed deep learning studies, only a small subset explicitly incorporates
post hoc explainability tools or fairness metrics, and even fewer optimise fairness-aware
objectives during training, which shows the gap between regulatory aspirations and cur-
rent practice.

6.1.4. Robustness and Privacy

Deep learning models are sensitive to concept drift caused by macroeconomic shocks,
behavioural changes, and portfolio rebalancing, leading to calibration decay over time [95].
Existing studies seldom incorporate drift-aware retraining or automated change detection.
For deployment-aligned robustness, studies should distinguish (i) temporal drift (vintage
and macro shifts), (ii) population drift (portfolio mix changes), and (iii) label/definition
drift (policy or collections-rule changes), and then evaluate mitigation using time-ordered
backtests rather than random re-sampling. Operationally, this translates to monitoring both
discrimination and calibration over time (e.g., AUC/AUPRC alongside Brier/ECE), trig-
gering review when calibration deviates materially even if ranking metrics appear stable.
At the same time, sharing granular data across institutions introduces privacy and
confidentiality constraints. Differentially private training and synthetic data generation
partially address these limitations but introduce accuracy trade-offs. Where collaboration
is required, privacy-preserving learning should be framed as an end-to-end design choice
(e.g., federated training with secure aggregation, differential privacy with documented
privacy budgets, or controlled synthetic-data release), accompanied by utility and bias
testing to show what decision quality is lost or retained under privacy constraints.

6.1.5. Operational Deployment and Governance

Operational success requires structured machine learning operations (MLOps)
pipelines with versioning, lineage tracking, monitoring, and challenger-champion testing.
Without these, systems accumulate technical debt that weakens compliance and under-
mines model lifecycle management [96]. In regulated credit settings, deployment discipline
is typically enforced through a model risk management workflow that makes each stage au-
ditable: reproducible feature pipelines, immutable training and evaluation datasets, signed
model artefacts, and traceable decision records that link every production score to a specific
model version and data snapshot. A common rollout pattern is staged release, in which
a candidate model first passes offline backtesting, then runs in shadow scoring (producing
scores without affecting approvals), and only then progresses to limited exposure with
pre-defined promotion gates based on calibration, drift, and stability checks. These gates
reduce failures that frequently occur in practice, such as silent calibration decay after policy
or collections-rule changes, performance drops under macroeconomic regime shifts, and
inconsistent feature computation between training and serving.

Moreover, existing governance artefacts, including datasheets and model cards, are
rarely integrated with regulatory processes such as Basel III, SR 11-7, or the EU AI Act,
reducing organisational readiness for external audit. To make interpretability and fairness
operational rather than ad hoc, explanation and bias-assessment outputs should be gener-
ated automatically per model version within the CI/CD workflow and stored as part of
the model evidence pack. Concretely, this means logging (i) global and local explanation
artefacts aligned with the deployed model family, (ii) fairness reports computed on the
production decision population (and, where feasible, on approved-outcome populations),
and (iii) monitoring dashboards that track both discrimination and calibration over time.
When exceptions occur (e.g., manual overrides, policy-driven rule changes, or temporary
risk controls), the governance layer should record the override rationale and its impact
on observed outcomes so that future retraining does not unknowingly encode short-term
interventions as predictive signals.

6.2. Future Research Directions

Future research should adopt evaluation frameworks that reflect realistic data-
generating processes, including temporally constrained train-test splits, multi-horizon
performance tracking, and calibration-aware reporting. This includes benchmarking on
large-scale, longitudinal datasets with explicit temporal structure and economic annota-
tions, enabling fair comparison across model families and reducing over-optimism asso-
ciated with small public datasets. Moreover, future work should prioritise cost-aligned
performance reporting, where model utility is quantified in terms of expected loss reduc-
tion, capital efficiency, default timing, and resilience across macroeconomic stress regimes
(Table 5).

Another direction is the development of learning objectives that integrate fairness, in-
terpretability, and economic cost at training time rather than relying on post hoc adjustment.
Interpretable-by-design architectures, monotonic neural networks, sparse attention mecha-
nisms, and hybrid symbolic-neural models can provide greater regulatory compatibility
while retaining feature interaction capacity. Causal fairness, adversarial debiasing, and
counterfactual training pipelines represent promising frameworks for mitigating disparate
impact without suppressing predictive power.

Challenge

Description

Emerging Research Directions

Evaluation Integrity

Temporal leakage and weak calibration
undermine external validity [18,23,58,87].

Imbalance and Reject Inference

Rare defaults and missing counterfactual
labels distort learning signals [88–90].

Interpretability and Fairness

Deep models violate explainability and
anti-bias compliance [92,97].

Robustness and Privacy

Drift and privacy constraints limit
long-term reliability [95,98].

Operational Deployment and Governance

Insufficient deployment discipline
increases regulatory risk [96,99].

Out-of-time and rolling validation;
calibration-aware reporting; cost-sensitive
and utility-aligned scoring.

Causal estimation, selective abstention,
semi-supervised reject inference, and
cost-sensitive objectives.

Interpretable-by-design architectures,
causal fairness constraints, certified
explanation mechanisms.

Drift-robust adaptive training, federated
learning, synthetic financial digital twins,
DP-SGD optimisation.

Automated monitoring frameworks,
model-card pipelines, Basel-aligned
documentation standards.

Research should also focus on designing models that adapt under uncertainty while
maintaining stability guarantees. Drift-aware architectures, online continual learning
mechanisms, uncertainty-calibrated predictions, and stress-testing under macroeconomic
scenario simulation may improve long-term reliability. Privacy-preserving collaborative
learning, through federated optimisation, secure multiparty computation, and high-fidelity
synthetic digital twins, would enable cross-institutional learning while respecting confiden-
tiality and regulation. This agenda also requires governance and regulatory alignment for
cross-institutional data sharing, including clear accountability for consent, access control,
retention, and auditability. Similarly, synthetic data should be governed with documented
generation protocols, privacy-risk testing, and downstream-use restrictions to avoid leakage
and unwarranted reliance in regulated decision-making.

Finally, there is a need for deployment-aligned governance frameworks that stan-
dardise model documentation, monitoring, and auditability. Integrated pipelines that
combine MLOps with regulatory artefacts, such as model cards linked to validation logs
and challenger-champion performance trails, could accelerate institutional trust and re-
duce compliance costs. Long-term progress will require systems that are not only more
accurate, but also certifiably fair, transparent, and robust—making deep learning suitable
for production-grade financial risk management.

7. Conclusions

This survey reviewed deep learning methods for credit risk prediction across tabu-
lar, sequential, transformer-based, and graph-structured settings. By organising existing
research through a unified taxonomy that links model families to data structures and
credit-risk objectives, the survey provides conceptual clarity on when and why specific
architectures are appropriate. Across the peer-reviewed evidence, deep models tend to
outperform traditional scorecard and ensemble methods when trained on sufficiently large,
temporally representative datasets with rich behavioural and relational information.

However, the literature also reveals gaps that constrain reliable real-world adoption.
Reporting standards are inconsistent, with limited use of temporally valid evaluation,
calibration metrics, and cost-aligned performance reporting. Interpretability and fairness
are often treated as add-ons rather than requirements, and robustness under concept drift,
data-sharing constraints, and operational governance remains weakly addressed, shifting
success criteria toward predictive accuracy rather than lifecycle reliability and auditability.

Future work should therefore prioritise deployment-aligned research: interpretable-
by-design modelling, temporally realistic benchmarks, fairness strategies grounded in the
decision and legal context, privacy-preserving collaborative learning, and governance-
ready monitoring and documentation pipelines. This survey is limited to peer-reviewed
English-language studies indexed in major databases and does not cover proprietary
implementations or regulatory grey literature; future syntheses could extend the evidence
base using secure-access supervisory data or meta-analyses where study designs and
outcomes are sufficiently comparable.

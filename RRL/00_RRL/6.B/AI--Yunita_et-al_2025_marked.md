Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Re-
current Units (GRUs) have gained signiﬁcant popularity in time series forecasting across diverse
domains including healthcare, astronomy, and engineering. However, the inherent variability in
model performance due to random weight initialization raises questions about the reliability and
consistency of these architectures for time series analysis. This study addresses this concern by
conducting a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of nine neural network architectures: vanilla
RNN, LSTM, GRU, and six hybrid conﬁgurations (RNN-LSTM, RNN-GRU, LSTM-RNN, GRU-RNN,
LSTM-GRU, and GRU-LSTM). Performance evaluation was conducted using Monte Carlo simu-
lation with 100 iterations across three real-world datasets: sunspot activity, Indonesian COVID-
19 cases, and dissolved oxygen concentration measurements. Statistical analysis employed the
Friedman test to assess performance diﬀerences across architectures. Results showed no statis-
tically signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the nine architectures. Despite the lack of statistical sig-
niﬁcance, consistent performance patterns emerged favoring LSTM-based hybrid architectures.
The LSTM-GRU and LSTM-RNN conﬁgurations demonstrated superior performance across mul-
tiple evaluation metrics, with LSTM-RNN excelling in sunspot and dissolved oxygen forecasting,
while standalone LSTM showed optimal performance for COVID-19 prediction. These ﬁndings
provide evidence-based guidance for architecture selection in time series forecasting applications,
suggesting that while statistical equivalence exists among architectures, LSTM-based hybrids oﬀer
practical advantages in terms of consistency and robustness across diverse temporal patterns.

•How do diﬀerent neural network architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU and its hybrid
models) with dual hidden layers perform across diverse time series datasets?
•What are the comparative advantages and trade-oﬀs between single and hybrid
neural network architectures in terms of multiple performance metrics and
computational eﬃciency for research and industrial applications?
•To what extent does a hybrid model integrating LSTM, RNN, and GRU outperform
single-algorithm approaches in terms of predictive accuracy and computational
eﬃciency using Monte Carlo-based evaluation?

The rapid expansion of the internet and distributed sensor networks has led to a signiﬁcant increase in the accumulation of
time series data. This type of data, consisting of sequences indexed by time, is crucial in various ﬁelds such as ﬁnance, meteorology,
inventory management, and health monitoring. Traditional approaches have primarily relied on parametric models guided by domain
knowledge, including linear regression, moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA [1,2]. In contrast, modern machine
learning methods enable the learning of temporal dynamics purely through data-driven techniques. Previous studies have shown
that deep learning architectures outperform traditional statistical methods [3,4]. With the surge in data availability and computing
power, machine learning has become an essential component of next-generation time series forecasting models. Time series data are
essential for analyzing trends and recognizing patterns that change over time, thus enabling accurate forecasting.

A variety of deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and
gated recurrent units (GRUs), have been designed to address the diverse nature of time series datasets across various domains. Neural
networks, which serve as the foundation for deep learning, use interconnected layers of nodes to learn and extract features from raw
data, making them powerful tools for various machine learning applications. Several studies have proposed hybrid machine learning
models incorporating multiple neural network approaches for forecasting time series data, such as RNN-LSTM [5], LSTM-RNN [6,7],
LSTM-GRU [8], and GRU-RNN [9].

These algorithms often rely on stochastic gradient descent or random initialization [10], which can result in varying results. Some
studies propose a hybrid model, but the proposed models were trained only once. In particular, initial training may produce a poor-
performing model, but retraining the same model may yield improved results. Hence, benchmarking these models to select models
is crucial in speciﬁc time series analysis scenarios.

A benchmark study [11] demonstrated that ML techniques, including Neural Network-based ones, are reliable to estimate the scour
depth of an experimental dataset with Monte Carlo (MC)-based evaluation. A Monte Carlo evaluation was applied on the performance
of the ’non-linear autoregressive model process with eXogenous input’ (NARX), a RNN based algorithm with embedded memory, on
time series data [12] and demonstrated that MC evaluation is more reliable than the traditional k-fold cross validation. Hence, we
extend this approach to conduct a MC evaluation on the nine diﬀerent neural network-based algorithm on time series data.

This study oﬀers three key contributions: (1) a comprehensive benchmark of nine neural network architectures with dual hidden
layers across diverse time series datasets, (2) implementation of Monte Carlo-based evaluation to guarantee the reliability of the
benchmarked algorithm, and (3) comparative analysis of single and hybrid architectures based on multiple performance metrics and
computational eﬃciency, providing practical guidelines for model selection in both research and industrial applications.

Method details

A review of RNN, LSTM and GRU for time series data

The main purpose of performing a time series analysis is to predict future values from existing historical data, which often show

speciﬁc patterns such as trends, seasonal behavior, cycles, or random ﬂuctuations, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

A trend is a sustained increase or decrease in the data values over an extended period. Trends can exhibit linear or nonlinear
characteristics. An illustrative example is the persistent rise in global temperatures observed over the past several decades. A seasonal

pattern repeats at consistent intervals as a result of seasonal inﬂuences. For example, retail sales typically increase annually during
the holidays. A cyclical pattern consists of long-term ﬂuctuations that lack the regularity of seasonal patterns and are frequently
inﬂuenced by economic or business cycles. An example is the cyclical nature of stock markets. Finally, random patterns arise from
unpredictable or random inﬂuences and do not adhere to any trend or seasonality. These patterns may result from sudden events,
errors, or noise.

Neural networks have been widely applied in forecasting time series data. RNNs, LSTM networks, and GRUs are particularly useful

for time series analysis, as they are capable of handling sequential data and learning long-term dependencies.

RNNs were developed to analyze time series data and have been used in various ﬁelds such as speech recognition, machine
translation, and image captioning [13]. RNNs process the incoming time series data using a separate vector at each time step, keeping
the information recorded at the previous time step hidden. The equations describing RNNs are as follows [14].

𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑊 ⋅ 𝑥𝑡 + 𝑈 ⋅ ℎ𝑅
ℎ𝑅
𝑡 + 𝑏𝑜)
𝑡 = 𝑔(𝑊 𝑜 ⋅ ℎ𝑅
𝑂𝑅

𝑡−1 + 𝑏)

(2.1)

(2.2)

Here, 𝑔 is the activation function (either hyperbolic tangent or logistic), 𝑂𝑅

is the previous hidden state, 𝑏 is the bias, and 𝑊  and 𝑈 are weights.

𝑡  is the output/prediction, 𝑥𝑡 is the input at time 𝑡, ℎ𝑅
𝑡−1

The LSTM algorithm was developed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 [15]. LSTM is a subtype of the RNN model and
addresses the issue of short-term memory in RNNs, in which prior information no longer inﬂuences the learning network. To this
end, a cell state is added in the LSTM architecture, enabling the network to store past information in memory for a longer period
[16].

An LSTM network contains a complex structure called an LSTM unit within the hidden layer, which comprises three gates: the
input, forget, and output gates. These gates are leveraged to selectively add or retain information in the cell state, which functions
to store a value or state.

GRUs are one of the most popular variants of RNNs. They feature a specialized neural network with dedicated gates, optimized
based on LSTM. Their structure is similar to that of an LSTM network, but the key diﬀerence is that a GRU combines the input gate

3

MethodsX 15 (2025) 103462

and forget gate into a single update gate. Thus, this model consists of two gates: the update gate, which controls how much of the
previous information needs to be retained in the current state, and the reset gate, which determines whether the previous information
and the current state should be connected [17].

The GRU is expressed using the following equations [18].

𝑧𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑥𝑧𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊ℎ𝑧ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑧)

𝑟𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑥𝑟𝑥𝑡 + 𝑊ℎ𝑟ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑟)

̃ℎ𝑡 = tanh(𝑊𝑥ℎ𝑥𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡 ⊙ 𝑊ℎℎℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑏ℎ)

ℎ𝑡 = (1 − 𝑧𝑡) ⊙ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑧𝑡 ⊙ ̃ℎ𝑡

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

Here, 𝑧𝑡 is the update gate, 𝑟𝑡 is the reset gate, ̃ℎ𝑡 is the new candidate state, ℎ𝑡 is the hidden state at time 𝑡, 𝜎 is the sigmoid

function, ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication, 𝑊  represents the corresponding weights, and 𝑏 is the bias.

Related works about hybrid models

Wang et al. [5] proposed the RNN-LSTM network in the context of construction projects to predict and identify quality problems in
steel bars, formworks, concrete, cast-in-place structures, and masonry that may occur during project implementation. These authors
did not provide a comparison with other models.

Muhuri et al. [6] compared several classiﬁer algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and LSTM-
RNN, using the NSL-KDD dataset for binary and multi-classiﬁcation problems. For multi-classiﬁcation, the LSTM-RNN network com-
bined with a genetic algorithm achieved signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than SVM and RF. In binary classiﬁcation, the accuracy of
LSTM-RNN was comparable to that of RF and exceeded that of SVM.

Another study by Pawar et al. [7] used several combinations of LSTM and RNN to forecast stock market prices. They compared
LSTM-RNN with standalone LSTM and other architectures of LSTM and RNN. They proposed that the LSTM-RNN model provided
more accurate results than traditional machine learning algorithms.

Zafar et al. [8] introduced an LSTM-GRU model to predict traﬃc speed in a speciﬁc city in Pakistan. The model integrated
heterogeneous data from sensors, services, and external sources into a hybrid spatiotemporal feature space. They evaluated various
models, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, GRU-LSTM, LSTM-GRU, CNN-GRU, and GRU-CNN, using three metrics:
RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Their ﬁndings revealed that the LSTM-GRU model outperformed all other approaches.

Xia et al. [9] used a stacked GRU-RNN model to predict renewable energy generation and determine the electrical loads required
to support smart grid operations. Their experiments included two scenarios: forecasting wind power generation based on multiple
weather parameters and predicting electrical loads using historical energy consumption data.

All related studies propose hybrid models based on RNN and its variations. However, the majority conduct only a single round of

training and testing.

Methods

The ﬂow chart of our benchmarking approach to achieve the reliability of neural network-based models is depicted in Fig. 2. We
collect three datasets in the domain of astronomy, healthcare, and machinery, respectively. Then, we conducted an exploratory data
analysis (EDA) as a preliminary statistical and data quality analysis on the three datasets. After that, we develop the neural network-
based models for the time series analysis. Finally, we evaluate the models with their random initialization in mind by repeating the
experiments to gain suﬃcient data for reliability analysis.

Datasets

We used three data sets in this study: 1) a sunspot dataset1, 2) a Covid-19 dataset [19] 2, and 3) an oil and gas dataset of daily
dissolved oxygen readings, as summarized in Table 1. The sunspot dataset contains sunspot data retrieved from the Kaggle website.
Sunspots are transient phenomena observed in the Sun’s photosphere, manifesting as darker regions relative to the surrounding
areas. These areas are characterized by a lower surface temperature, attributable to concentrations of magnetic ﬂux that suppress
convective processes. Typically, sunspots emerge in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity, and their occurrence ﬂuctuates according
to the approximately 11-year solar cycle. The dataset consists of the monthly mean total sunspot number observations, collected
between 1749 and 2018. The COVID-19 dataset comprises the daily count of new COVID-19 cases in Jakarta, Indonesia, spanning
634 days from 1 March 2020 until 2 December 2021. The oxygen dataset consists of daily dissolved oxygen readings collected from
an oil and gas plant.

Exploratory data analysis

The EDA reveals that the datasets have distinct statistical information as summarized in Table 1. The sunspot, covid-19, and
oxygen datasets has 3625, 634, and 1033 records, respectively, and do not have missing values. We transformed the Covid-19
dataset using boxcox because the data have a drastic change. As depicted in Fig. 3, the datasets may have outliers and can impact
the performance analysis. However, we omit the outlier detection and removal because we want to observe the robustness of the
benchmarked algorithms against the outliers.

The three datasets also show a time-dependent pattern, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which the value at any given time is aﬀected by
previous values in the time series. It remains unclear whether this dependency is inﬂuenced by external factors or is intrinsic to the
temporal sequence itself. The discussion of time-dependent pattern is currently outside the scope of this research.

Model development

As described in the previous section, hybrid models, such as GRU-LSTM are advantageous towards a sensor reading-based time
series dataset. Thus, we benchmark both the original and hybrid methods of nine neural network-based machine learning algorithms,
namely RNN, LSTM, GRU, RNN-LSTM, RNN-GRU, LSTM-RNN, GRU-RNN, LSTM-GRU, and GRU-LSTM. We present the architecture
of the time series forecasting algorithms in Table 2. We limit the hidden layers on each architecture into two. The choice of using
two hidden layers is based on the minimal architectural requirement to eﬀectively combine neural network models.

Furthermore, we set the numbers of parameter to be relatively the same, except RNN and GRU-RNN that need fewer numbers of
parameters. GRU-RNN models have fewer parameters because both GRU and vanilla RNN have simpler architectures compared to
LSTM, resulting in less complexity and fewer trainable weights [18].

Model evaluation

To prepare the benchmarking, we need to deﬁne the training and test split of each dataset, as described by the last row of
Table 1. We evaluate the forecasting performance of each model using three error metrics and computational eﬃciency metric. The

RMSE, calculated as the square root of the average squared diﬀerences between predicted and actual values, penalizes larger errors
more heavily due to its quadratic nature, making it particularly sensitive to outliers in the time series data. Additionally, computation
time was measured to assess the practical feasibility of each model for real-time speed predictions. This comprehensive evaluation
framework allows for a balanced assessment of both prediction accuracy and computational eﬃciency, essential factors in the relia-
bility of time series analysis.

Monte Carlo-based evaluation

We implement MC simulation as a comprehensive benchmarking approach for neural network models. This evaluation framework
implements random sampling through multiple iterations of model training, where each iteration begins with a diﬀerent random
weight initialization and performs time series forecasting on the training dataset. The methodology enables robust analysis of model
performance across repeated experiments, providing insights into the models’ reliability and stability.

The evaluation protocol consists of 100 independent runs, each comprising 100 training epochs. The resulting performance metrics
and predictions are analyzed using a 95 % conﬁdence interval, where we trim 2.5 % from both upper and lower bounds to eliminate
extreme outliers. This statistical approach provides a reliable estimation of model parameters and their associated uncertainty ranges.
This probabilistic approach adheres to the fundamental principles of Monte Carlo methods, which facilitate the estimation of complex
high-dimensional integrals through random sampling processes [22,23]. By aggregating results across multiple stochastic trials, our
framework quantiﬁes prediction uncertainty and parameter sensitivity, oﬀering a more complete characterization of model behavior
than single-run evaluations.

Besides model performance evaluation using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE across 100 independent runs on three datasets, statistical
comparison was conducted using the Friedman test [24]. The test represents the superior analytical method, especially when evalu-
ating multiple diﬀerent models across several datasets, as it is a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA that tests
whether model rankings diﬀer signiﬁcantly across datasets and iterations [25,26].

Benchmarking result and discussion

We present the analysis of our benchmarking results across the datasets, followed by a detailed discussion of the ﬁndings. We

evaluate the performance of various neural network models using both error metrics and computational eﬃciency measures.

Experimental settings

All experiments were conducted using Google Colab’s standard runtime environment with an Intel Xeon CPU and 12.72 GB
RAM. The implementation was developed using Python with essential data science and machine learning frameworks. For numerical
computing and data structure manipulation, we utilized NumPy and pandas respectively. Data visualization was accomplished through
Matplotlib, while the deep learning models were implemented using TensorFlow 2.0. This software stack ensures reproducibility and
provides robust tools for time series analysis and neural network implementation.

Results

We present our experimental results across three distinct datasets, analyzing both the predictive accuracy and computational eﬃ-
ciency of each model. The results are evaluated using MAE, MAPE, RMSE, and computation time metrics, with uncertainty quantiﬁed
through MC simulation of 100 iterations.

Table 3 shows the Friedman Test results for the nine RNN architectures and Table 4 shows the overall model performance rankings
based on Friedman test analysis. The Friedman test revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the nine RNN architectures
(𝜒 2 = 12.593, df = 8, 𝑝 = .127). Although the test statistic suggested some variation in model performance, the diﬀerences were not
suﬃcient to reject the null hypothesis of equal performance at the 𝛼 = 0.05 signiﬁcance level.

Despite the lack of statistical signiﬁcance, descriptive analysis revealed performance variations among the architectures. The
LSTM-GRU hybrid architecture achieved the lowest mean rank (2.23), while the vanilla RNN showed the highest mean rank (8.57).
However, these diﬀerences should be interpreted with caution given the non-signiﬁcant omnibus test result. Hybrid architectures
consistently outperformed single-architecture models, with LSTM-GRU achieving the lowest mean rank (2.23).

Sunspot dataset

Fig. 4 depicts the performance metrics for the nine algorithms in the sunspot dataset with the MC evaluation. From our compre-
hensive analysis of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics across diﬀerent neural network architectures, LSTM-based models consistently
demonstrate superior performance and stability. The LSTM-GRU hybrid achieves the lowest median MAE (16.88) with minimal
spread, followed by LSTM-RNN with median MAE of 16.92. On the other hand, GRU-LSTM shows the best median MAPE (36.10 %)
with the smallest spread, followed by LSTM-RNN with median MAPE of 37.20. For RMSE, the LSTM-GRU architecture outperforms
hybrid variants with the lowest median (23.17) and smallest spread, followed by LSTM-RNN and LSTM. This pattern suggests that
LSTM-RNN architecture, as the second-best performer, provide robust and reliable predictions for time series forecasting for the
sunspot dataset which exhibits cyclical-like patterns.

Analysis of error metrics shows that RNN-based architectures exhibit consistent underperformance patterns. The vanilla RNN
model exhibits the highest error rates and largest variances (MAE: 18.74, MAPE: 50.82 %, RMSE: 25.51), highlighting its inherent
limitations in capturing long-term dependencies in sunspot time series data. The substantial MAPE value is particularly noteworthy,
indicating that RNN predictions deviate by approximately half of the true values. Given the cyclical-like nature of sunspot activity,
ranging from near-zero to 400 counts, such large percentage errors signiﬁcantly impact the model’s reliability. While the error spread
remains moderately consistent, suggesting some degree of predictable behavior, the magnitude of these errors underscores RNN’s
fundamental challenges in time series forecasting compared to the more sophisticated LSTM and GRU-based architectures.

The comparative analysis of the sunspot dataset demonstrates that hybrid architectures, particularly LSTM-RNN, outperform single
architectures while maintaining computational eﬃciency. While the vanilla RNN model exhibits higher variability and larger error
rates, the LSTM-RNN hybrid achieves a balanced trade-oﬀ between prediction accuracy and processing overhead, as evidenced in
Fig. 5. The vanilla RNN and some RNN-combined models (RNN-LSTM and LSTM-RNN) achieve relatively shorter training time than
the others. Thus, the short training time and better performance of LSTM-RNN over 100 iterations of suggested that, for the sunspot
dataset, it has the most reliable performance across all three error metrics without incurring excessive computational costs. This
suggests that LSTM-RNN oﬀers a pragmatic solution for sunspot prediction, eﬀectively balancing accuracy and resource utilization.

Covid-19 dataset

The performance metrics of the nine algorithms towards the Indonesia Covid-19 daily new cases dataset can be seen in Fig. 6.
LSTM, GRU, LSTM-GRU, and GRU-LSTM models achieve median MAEs of 0.90–0.91 where LSTM having the smallest spread. This
pattern is also consistent with RMSE, where the medians of those four models span around 1.14 and 1.16. These patterns suggest
that the new cases forecasting of those four models have error close to 0.01. On the other hand, the MAPE metrics suggest that
the vanilla LSTM signiﬁcantly outperformed the other models, with close margin on the medians and the smallest spread. Thus, the
vanilla LSTM architecture performed relatively the best in this dataset with our MC-based evaluation on the random initialization
over 100 iterations.

The MC evaluation of COVID-19 case forecasting, illustrated in Fig. 6, reveals consistent limitations of the RNN architecture,
mirroring our ﬁndings from the sunspot analysis. The RNN model exhibits notably higher median values across all metrics (MAE:
1.20, MAPE: 12.88 %, RMSE: 1.58) compared to other architectures. Moreover, its substantial spread in error distributions-evidenced
by wider box plots and numerous outliers in the metrics-indicates signiﬁcant prediction instability. This high variability, coupled
with larger error magnitudes, suggests that RNN may not be reliable to capture the patterns inherent in Indonesia Covid-19 new daily
cases dataset.

Fig. 7 illustrates the mean computation time for training each of the nine architectures on the COVID-19 dataset. While the vanilla
RNN demonstrates notably eﬃcient training times, requiring less than 20 seconds per iteration, its computational advantage is
overshadowed by its inferior forecasting performance. Among the top-performing models-LSTM, GRU, LSTM-GRU, and GRU-LSTM-
the computational requirements vary signiﬁcantly. Although LSTM-GRU achieves competitive accuracy, its higher computational
overhead makes it less practical for COVID-19 case forecasting. Balancing predictive accuracy with computational eﬃciency, our
analysis suggests that single LSTM and GRU-LSTM architectures emerge as the most promising candidates for COVID-19 forecasting
applications, oﬀering reliable performance without excessive computational demands.

Oxygen dataset

Fig. 8 illustrates the Monte Carlo evaluation results for the Oxygen dataset across all architectures. The LSTM-RNN hybrid demon-
strates marginally better performance with the lowest error rates (MAE: 2.96, MAPE: 7.45 %, RMSE: 4.04), followed closely by
LSTM-GRU. Both hybrid architectures exhibit not only competitive accuracy but also smaller variances in their predictions. This
stability suggests enhanced reliability in handling the dataset’s challenging characteristics, particularly the pronounced ﬂuctuations
in the initial readings and the upward trend in dissolved oxygen concentrations observed in the latter portion of the dataset.

The vanilla RNN architecture, while showing only marginally higher median errors (MAE: 3.29, MAPE: 8.28 %, RMSE: 4.43),
exhibits notably larger variance across all metrics. This increased spread, particularly visible in the extended whiskers and outliers
of the box plots, indicates less consistent prediction reliability. The wider error distribution suggests that RNN’s performance is more
susceptible to initial conditions and training variations, making it a less dependable choice for oxygen level forecasting despite its
similar median performance to other models.

Fig. 9 presents the mean training time across all architectures, with RNN, GRU-RNN, and GRU-LSTM achieving the fastest train-
ing times. While GRU-LSTM requires only 84.97 seconds for training, its marginal computational advantage is oﬀset by slightly
higher error metrics compared to LSTM-RNN. The LSTM-RNN architecture, despite requiring 89.34 seconds for training-a mere 5-
second diﬀerence-demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy across all metrics. This minimal computational overhead suggests that
LSTM-RNN oﬀers an optimal balance between prediction accuracy and computational eﬃciency for dissolved oxygen concentration
forecasting, as the slight increase in training time yields meaningful improvements in prediction reliability.

Discussion

Selecting an optimal neural network architecture for time series forecasting requires careful consideration of both computational
eﬃciency and prediction performance. Our benchmark investigation across three diverse datasets-Sunspot activity, COVID-19 cases,
and dissolved oxygen concentration-reveals nuanced diﬀerences in model capabilities. Through Monte Carlo evaluation of nine diﬀer-
ent architectures, including both single and hybrid conﬁgurations, we observe using boxplot analysis that while LSTM-RNN demon-
strates marginally better performance, the diﬀerences are not consistently signiﬁcant across all datasets. This observation aligns with
the “no free lunch” theorem, suggesting that architectural advantages may be dataset-speciﬁc rather than universal.

The benchmark reveals that while the vanilla RNN consistently achieves the fastest computation time across all datasets, it demon-
strates signiﬁcant limitations in forecasting accuracy. For the Sunspot dataset, as seen on Table 3, RNN shows the highest error rates
and largest standard deviation (MAE: 18.876 ± 1.546, MAPE: 50.941 % ± 5.751 % , RMSE: 25.678 ± 2.197), indicating funda-
mental limitations in capturing long-term dependencies. Similar patterns emerge in the COVID-19 dataset, where RNN’s performance
metrics suggest insuﬃcient capability to model complex epidemiological patterns. Although the diﬀerences are less pronounced in
the Oxygen dataset (MAE: 3.322 ± 0.566, MAPE: 8.251 % ± 1.435 % , RMSE: 4.455 ± 0.576), RNN still exhibits larger variance,
indicating less reliable predictions despite competitive median performance.

Conversely, LSTM-based architectures, particularly in hybrid conﬁgurations, demonstrate superior performance. The LSTM-RNN
hybrid achieves remarkable accuracy across datasets, with only marginal computational overhead compared to more eﬃcient models.
For instance, in the Oxygen dataset, LSTM-RNN requires only 5 seconds of additional training time compared to GRU-LSTM, while

delivering better prediction stability. Given these marginal computational trade-oﬀs and consistent performance advantages, LSTM-
RNN emerges as a promising choice for time series forecasting applications where prediction reliability is crucial- although simpler
architectures such as RNNs oﬀer faster training times.

Refer to Fig. 9, our ﬁndings from Oxygen Dataset in line with previous studies such as Shewalkar et al. [27], who advocate for
GRU over LSTM based on computational eﬃciency. In our benchmark, GRU shows superior performance to LSTM. The eﬀectiveness
of hybrid architectures, particularly LSTM-GRU, indicates that combining complementary architectural strengths can yield improved
forecasting capabilities without excessive computational demands. It is important to note here, although the Friedman test showed
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the nine RNN architectures (𝜒 2 = 12.593, df = 8, 𝑝 = .127), descriptive analysis revealed
notable performance variations. The LSTM-GRU hybrid architecture achieved the lowest mean rank (2.23), suggesting potential
practical advantages despite the lack of statistical signiﬁcance.

However, several limitations should be considered. While the benchmarked neural network models demonstrate robust handling of
noise and outliers in the COVID-19 and Oxygen datasets, the Sunspot dataset’s wider value range presents more signiﬁcant challenges
for accurate prediction. These limitations suggest opportunities for future research, including investigating adaptive architectures that
can better handle varying data scales and characteristics. Such studies could enhance our understanding of neural network capabilities
across diﬀerent data distributions and lead to more versatile forecasting solutions.

While this study presents comparative results across multiple neural network architectures using consistent Monte Carlo-based
evaluations, formal statistical signiﬁcance test (e.g., Friedman test) was applied to strengthen comparative conclusion [24–26]. Using
the MAE, MAPE, and RMSE value, the best architecture vary, such as for the Sunspot Dataset, when evaluated using MAPE, the top
three algorithms are GRU-LSTM, LSTM-RNN, and LSTM, with MAPE values of 36.242 ± 3.627, 37.277 ± 3.635, and 38.500 ± 3.654,
respectively. When evaluated using RMSE, the test indicates that LSTM-GRU, LSTM-RNN, and LSTM demonstrate RMSE values of
23.205 ± 0.827, 23.386 ± 0.966, and 23.557 ± 1.115 , respectively. The diﬀerences observed between MAPE and RMSE results
can be attributed to their fundamental characteristics. MAPE expresses accuracy as a percentage, making it suitable for relative error
assessment, whereas RMSE focuses on absolute prediction accuracy and penalizes larger errors more heavily. This suggests that the
best-performing model depends on the speciﬁc aspect being evaluated. Model robustness is reﬂected in its consistency across multiple
metrics, while domain expertise remains essential for selecting the appropriate evaluation priority.

The Friedman test showed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the nine RNN architectures (𝜒 2 = 12.593, df = 8, 𝑝 = .127).

However, this result should be interpreted within the context of the experimental design and practical considerations.

Despite the lack of statistical signiﬁcance, several observations merit discussion:

• The LSTM-GRU hybrid achieved consistently lower mean ranks (2.23) across all datasets
• Hybrid architectures generally outperformed single-architecture models in descriptive analysis
• The vanilla RNN showed consistently poor performance (mean rank: 8.57)

In terms of practical application, the ﬁndings of this study might have promising applicability across various real-world sectors.
For example, the proposed approach can be embedded in early warning systems to anticipate events before they occur. In the
ﬁeld of medical monitoring, it may assist in tracking patient conditions and facilitating early preventive actions. Furthermore, in

environmental management. These applications demonstrate the broader utility of our approach beyond theoretical performance,
particularly in scenarios requiring continuous, real-time decision support.

Conclusions

In this study, nine diﬀerent neural network architectures, including RNN, LSTM, GRU, and their hybrid conﬁgurations, were
evaluated using three real-world time series datasets: sunspot activity, Indonesian COVID-19 cases, and dissolved oxygen concentra-
tion readings. Model performance was assessed through one hundred iterations of Monte Carlo simulation using multiple evaluation
metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and computation time.
The Friedman test revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the nine RNN architectures (𝜒 2 = 12.593, df = 8, 𝑝 = .127).
This non-signiﬁcant result may be attributed to several factors: ﬁrst, the limited sample size with only three datasets used for evalu-
ation, and second, performance diﬀerences that may have been masked by experimental noise. While statistical signiﬁcance was not
achieved, the consistent performance patterns observed across datasets suggest potential practical advantages for hybrid architectures
that warrant further investigation with larger sample sizes or diﬀerent experimental conditions.

Despite performance variations across individual datasets, our analysis identiﬁed several persistent characteristics. The vanilla
RNN, although computationally eﬃcient, consistently demonstrated inferior forecasting capabilities across all datasets, exhibiting
higher error rates and greater forecast variability. In contrast, LSTM-based architectures, particularly the LSTM-RNN and LSTM-GRU
hybrids, consistently exhibited superior performance across diverse datasets, albeit with slightly longer computation times. Speciﬁc
architectural strengths emerged for diﬀerent prediction tasks. The LSTM-RNN conﬁguration demonstrated exceptional potential for
forecasting sunspot activity and dissolved oxygen concentrations, while the standalone LSTM architecture performed particularly
well in COVID-19 case prediction, especially when evaluated using MAE and MAPE metrics. These ﬁndings indicate that LSTM-based
architectures provide robust performance across various time series characteristics, despite marginal diﬀerences in some metrics that
align with the “no free lunch” principle.

The study’s limitations primarily stem from the constrained experimental design, including the limited number of datasets and
potential masking of performance diﬀerences by experimental variability. For future research, we recommend several improvements:
increasing the number of datasets to enhance statistical power, implementing alternative statistical approaches such as Bayesian anal-
ysis, and focusing on practical signiﬁcance alongside statistical measures. Additionally, future investigations could explore adaptive
neural network architectures that dynamically adjust parameters such as neuron count and activation functions to optimize time
series forecasting capabilities across diverse data distributions. Such adaptive approaches may provide more robust solutions for
real-world applications where data characteristics vary signiﬁcantly.

For practical implications, while the statistical analysis did not reveal signiﬁcant diﬀerences among architectures, the con-
sistent performance patterns observed provide valuable guidance for practitioners. LSTM-based hybrid architectures, particularly

15

MethodsX 15 (2025) 103462

LSTM-RNN and LSTM-GRU conﬁgurations, demonstrate reliable performance across multiple domains and should be considered as
primary candidates for time series forecasting applications. However, the choice of architecture should also consider computational
constraints and speciﬁc application requirements, as the vanilla RNN may still be suitable for scenarios where computational eﬃciency
outweighs marginal performance gains.

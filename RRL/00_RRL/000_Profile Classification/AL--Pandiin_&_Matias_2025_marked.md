Abstract  –  This  study  compares  the  predictive  modeling  techniques  for  loan
eligibility  assessment,  comparing  Logistic  Regression,  Random  Forest,  and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) with detailed oversampling and feature selection
methods. Using a Kaggle dataset, various feature selection techniques, including
Correlation-Based  Selection,  Recursive  Feature  Elimination  (RFE),  and  Lasso
Regression  was  employed  for  feature  selection  before  applying  it  to  three
classifiers:  Random  Forest,  Logistic  Regression,  and  Support  Vector  Machine
(SVM), were optimized through Genetic Algorithms (GA). Performance metrics,
including  accuracy,  precision, recall, and  F1-score, alongside  cross-validation,
were  employed  for  model  evaluation.  Random  Forest  achieved  the  highest
performance with an accuracy of 85%, precision of 86%, recall of 84%, and F1-
score  of  85%.  Cross  validation  results  for  Random  Forest  averaged  92%,
demonstrating  consistent  robustness.  Feature  importance  analysis  identified
Credit History (26.8%), Applicant Income (19.7%), and Loan Amount (19.2%)
as  the  most  influential  factors,  while  demographic  attributes  like  Gender  and
Education  had  minimal  impact.  SVM  excelled  in  recall  (99%)  but  showed
moderate  accuracy  (71%)  and  lower  precision  (63%),  reflecting  challenges  in
minimizing  false  positives.  Logistic  Regression exhibited consistent  yet  lower
accuracy (67%) and struggled to model complex relationships in the dataset. The
findings highlight Random Forest's strength in delivering balanced predictions,
making  it  the  most  suitable  model  for  fairness  and  risk  management  in  loan
approvals.  Practical  deployment  via  a  user-friendly  web  application
demonstrated the usability of machine learning models for operational efficiency
in  financial  institutions.  This  research  advocates  for  integrating  Genetic
Algorithms with  machine learning  for enhanced  predictive modeling, ensuring
precise, efficient, and fair decision making processes.

Introduction

Machine learning teaches machines to handle information more efficiently [1]. It
is a form of artificial intelligence that enables a computer program to learn from prior
tasks. Analyzes data, detects patterns, and requires minimum human participation [2].
Machine  learning  investigates  designing  and  implementing  algorithms  capable  of
making data predictions. It is used to create programs with tuning parameters that are

                                                    13                                                                                                https://journals.carsu.edu.ph/AEIS

subsequently adjusted to improve performance by responding to previous data [3]. Over
the last few decades, the financial services industry has seen significant developments.
On  the  one  hand,  the  scope  of  activities  in  the  financial  industry  has  expanded
dramatically, encompassing a wide range of new banking, investment, and insurance
products, as well as new financing instruments and corporate finance methods [4][5].
Loan  lending  has  played  a  significant  role  in  the  daily  lives  of  both  businesses  and
individuals. With the ever-increasing competitiveness in the financial sector and many
financial restraints, accepting loans has become inescapable [6].

Banks provide various products in our banking system, but their primary source of
income is credit lines. As a result, they are likely to benefit from the interest in their
loans. Loans, or whether clients repay or fail on their loans, impact a bank's profits and
losses  [7].  People  desire  to  apply  for  online  loans  since  data  grows  daily  due  to
digitalization in the banking industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), a common approach
to information exploration, has received increased attention. Individuals from diverse
businesses  use  it.  AI  computations  will  take  care  of  the  issues  based  on  industry
knowledge. Banks need help with approving loans. Most banks benefit from loans but
selecting suitable consumers from a pool of applicants is hazardous. One error might
result in a significant loss for a bank [8].

Several  banks  and  lending  companies,  tiny  ones,  still  need  to  adapt  their
modernization  processes.  They  still  use  manual  methods  to  choose  the  approval and
borrower data. With the presence of machine learning and AI, we will explore Genetic
algorithms and choose among the best classifiers to combine with GA-named Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to test the accuracy level of their performance,
which  is  fit  for  predicting  the  borrower's  approval.  Evaluate  the  efficiency  models,
develop,  validate,  and  optimize  machine  learning  models  through  rigorous  training,
fine-tuning,  and  evaluation  using  relevant  performance  metrics.  Deploy  the  model
using web applications and implement a user-friendly web application that leverages
trained models, enabling seamless data input and accurate user prediction output.

five machine learning algorithms SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and
Stochastic Gradient Descent highlighting their strengths and limitations [9]; however,
it does not explore advanced optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA)
for feature selection, potentially limiting model performance, and applies SMOTE only
to the validation dataset, leaving the training data imbalanced, which could impact real-
world applicability [10]. Similarly, Mnkandla et al. (2024) develop a machine learning-

feature  selection  methods  like  GA  or  Lasso  regularization  and  overlooking  class
imbalance, which can bias predictions [12]. Likewise, propose an AI-driven machine

region-specific data and fairness-aware AI for ethical financial decision-making [15].

3  Methods

This section provides a detailed description of the hardware and software utilized
during the development process and the benchmark datasets sourced from Kaggle. It
focuses  on  comparing  the  performance  of  three  classifiers  -  Logistic  Regression,
Random  Forest,  and  Support  Vector  Machine  -  under  various  feature  selection
techniques, namely Correlation-based selection, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE),
SelectKBest,  and  Lasso.  Additionally,  it  integrates  Genetic  Algorithm  to  optimize
feature selection and identifies the classifier that achieves the highest accuracy.  This
approach  aims  to  enhance  the  predictive  performance  of  the  models  and  provide  a
robust comparison.

Fig. 1. Framework of the Study

3.1  Data Collection

For  data  collection,  raw  data  will  be  sourced  directly  from  Kaggle,  providing  a
robust  set  of samples to support this research. Kaggle’s datasets are  known for their
diversity, quality, and extensive real-world applications, making it an ideal repository
for obtaining the data required for thorough analysis. By leveraging Kaggle’s data, the
study  will  access  a  well-structured  sample  encompassing  a  wide  range  of  variables
relevant to the research objectives. This will enable in-depth exploration and accurate
modeling,  ensuring  the  findings  are  reliable  and  applicable  in  real-world  scenarios.
Using Kaggle’s dataset as a sample source aligns with the  research’s need for high-
quality, authentic data that accurately represents the chosen topic

3.2  Preprocessing and Balancing

The data processing workflow begins with Data Loading, where the raw loan dataset
is  imported  for  analysis.  Following  this,  an  Exploratory  Data  Analysis  (EDA)  is
conducted  to  gain  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  dataset’s  distribution,  the
presence of missing values, and any potential outliers that could impact the analysis or
model  performance.  The  next  step  is  Data  Cleaning,  where  missing  values  are
appropriately handled, and outliers are addressed to ensure data integrity and reliability

                                                    15                                                                                                 https://journals.carsu.edu.ph/AEIS

Paper—Predictive Modeling for Loan Eligibility Assessment: A Comparative Study of Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine with Detailed Oversampling

for subsequent modeling. Finally, Data Balancing techniques, such as oversampling,
are applied to the minority class (e.g., “not approved” loans) to correct class imbalances
and  reduce  bias  during  model  training.  This  sequential  approach  ensures  the  data  is
structured, representative, and ready for model development.

3.3  Feature Selection

A Genetic Algorithm for feature selection begins with the Initialization step, where
an initial population of feature subsets is  generated. Each subset is then subjected to
Fitness Evaluation, where its performance is measured using a classifier's accuracy or
F1-score,  typically  assessed  through  5  K-Fold  Cross-Validation  to  ensure  robust
evaluation. In the Selection phase, only the fittest individuals are chosen to progress to
the next generation, ensuring that high-performing feature subsets are prioritized. These
selected  individuals  undergo  Crossover,  where  their  features  are  combined  to  create
new  offspring,  promoting  the  inheritance  of  beneficial  feature  combinations.
Additionally, Mutation introduces random modifications to some features, allowing the
algorithm to explore new possibilities and avoid local optima. This selection process,
crossover,  and  mutation  are  repeated  until  a  Termination  criterion  is  met,  such  as
reaching  a  maximum  number  of  generations.  Finally,  the  algorithm  concludes  with
Feature Selection, where the optimal feature subset from the final generation is selected,
representing the most relevant features for the classification task.

3.4  Model training and Evaluation

The model-building process involves a structured approach to classifier selection,
training, and evaluation to ensure optimal performance on the loan dataset. Classifier
Selection is the initial step, where suitable classifiers, such as Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are chosen based on the problem’s
requirements  and  the  data  characteristics.  Each  classifier  offers  distinct  advantages:
Random  Forest  handles  non-linear  relationships  well,  Logistic  Regression  is
interpretable for binary outcomes, and SVM is practical for high-dimensional spaces.
Model Training follows, where the selected classifiers are trained on a balanced version
of the dataset, incorporating relevant features to improve the model's generalizability
and predictive power. Finally, Model Evaluation is conducted using a held-out test set,
employing  metrics  such  as  accuracy,  precision,  recall,  and  F1-score  to  gauge  each
model’s  effectiveness.  These  metrics  provide  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  model
performance,  enabling  the identification  of the  most reliable classifier  for predicting
loan approvals.

3.5  Model Selection and Deployment

The model selection process involves identifying the best-performing model based
on key performance metrics, ensuring the chosen model aligns closely with the desired
outcomes and accuracy requirements. Once the optimal model is selected, it undergoes
a refitting  procedure where it  is  retrained  on the  entire  training  dataset, utilizing the
most  effective  subset  of  features  identified  during  model  tuning.  This  refitting  step
ensures  that  the  model  fully  leverages  all  available  training  data  for  improved

                                                   AEIS Vol. 001, No. 001, 2025

          16

generalization  and  robustness.  Finally,  the  refitted  model  is  saved  for  future  use  or
deployment,  allowing  seamless  application  in  real-world  scenarios  or  subsequent
analyses.

Results & Discussion

In  addressing  the  problem  of  class  imbalance  in  a  loan  dataset  by  performing
oversampling and preparing a balanced dataset for future predictive modeling. It begins
with  loading  the  dataset  and  conducting  Exploratory  Data  Analysis  (EDA)  to
understand  its  structure,  including  identifying  missing  values,  generating  summary
statistics, and visualizing the original distribution of the target variable, `Loan_Status`.
The EDA reveals that the dataset is imbalanced, with more instances of loan approvals
("Y") than denials ("N"), which could negatively impact the performance of machine
learning models.

Fig. 2. Distribution of Loan Status Imbalance to Balance

To resolve this imbalance, the code implements Oversampling using the `resample`
method. The minority class (`Loan_Status == 'N'`) is resampled with replacement to
create a dataset where both the majority and minority classes have the same number of
instances.  This  ensures  an  equal  representation  of  both  classes,  which  is  critical  for
building unbiased and fair predictive models. After oversampling, the code validates
the  balancing  process  by  visualizing  the  new  distribution  of  `Loan_Status`  and
displaying the class counts.

Finally,  the  balanced  dataset  is  saved  as  `balanced_loandata.csv`,  providing  a
preprocessed  and  balanced  version  of  the  dataset  for  future  use  in  machine  learning
experiments.  This  preprocessing  step  is  crucial  for  improving  the  reliability  and
accuracy of predictive models that will be trained on this data.

 In this experiment, the goal is to evaluate how different feature selection methods
affect  the  performance  of  three  machine  learning  classifiers  for  predicting  loan
approvals. The dataset used is a preprocessed and balanced version of the loan dataset,
with categorical features encoded into numerical values and missing values handle. The
feature selection methods applied include Correlation-Based Selection, which identifies
features most correlated with the target variable; Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE),
which  iteratively  removes  the  least  important  features;  SelectKBest,  which  selects
features  based  on  their  statistical  relationship  with  the  target  variable;  and  Lasso
Regression, which uses L1 regularization to shrink coefficients of less relevant features
to  zero.  The  classifiers  utilized  in  this  experiment  are  Logistic  Regression,  Random
Forest, and  Support Vector  Machine (SVM).  Each classifier is  trained  on subsets  of
features derived from the feature selection  methods.  The models are evaluated using
accuracy as the primary metric, with the goal of determining the optimal combination
of feature selection technique and classifier for loan approval prediction.

Fig. 3. Accuracy of Different Classifier with Various Feature Selection Method

The results highlight how different feature selection methods impact the accuracy of
three classifiers - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Logistic Regression
showed consistent performance across all methods, with Lasso achieving the highest
accuracy (67.27%). Random Forest performed similarly with Correlation-Based, RFE,
and  SelectKBest  (67.27%),  but  its  accuracy  significantly  improved  to  88.48%  with

Lasso,  demonstrating  its  ability  to  leverage  sparse  and  optimized  feature  sets
effectively. In contrast, SVM achieved its best performance (70.91%) with Correlation-
Based,  RFE,  and  SelectKBest,  but  its  accuracy  dropped  significantly  with  Lasso
(52.73%), suggesting that overly aggressive feature reduction can hinder its ability to
model complex decision boundaries. Overall, Random Forest with Lasso emerged as
the  best-performing  combination,  indicating  the  importance  of  tailoring  feature
selection methods to the classifier's strength.

  Table  2  show  the  evident  that  Credit_History  is  the  most  critical  feature,
contributing the approximately 28.82% to the model’s predictive accuracy. This aligns
with domain knowledge, where an individual’s credit history often plays a significant
role  in  determining  the  loan  approval  likelihood.  Following  Credit_History,
ApplicantIncome (19.70%) and  LoanAmount (19.19%) are the  next  most influential
feature, collectively accounting for nearly 40% of the most importance. These features
reflect an applicant’s financial capability, which is a key determinant in loan decisions.
Features  like  CoapplicantIncome  (10.54%)  and  Property_Area  (5.29%)  also  hold
moderate importance, highlighting the relevance  of combined household income and
the geographical region in the decision-making process. Lower-ranked features such as
Dependents, Loan_Amount_Term, and Married exhibit reduced influence, contributing
between 4.13% and 2.69% each. Lastly, demographic  variables like Self_Employed,
Education, and Gender show minimal impact, each contributing less than 2.5% to the
model’s accuracy.

Fig. 4. Accuracy of Different Classifiers with Various Feature Selection Methods

 The figure illustrates the test accuracy of three classifiers - Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - when applied to features selected
through  a  Genetic  Algorithm.  This  visualization  is  directly  tied  to  the  evaluation
process outlined in the code, where the Genetic Algorithm optimizes feature subsets for
each  classifier  to  enhance  prediction  performance.  It  shows  that  Random  Forest
significantly  outperforms  the  other  classifiers,  achieving  the  highest  accuracy.  This
result reflects its ability to handle complex feature interactions effectively, which is a
key  strength  of  ensemble  learning  methods.  In  contrast,  Logistic  Regression
demonstrates  the  lowest  accuracy,  indicating  its  limitations  in  capturing  non-linear
relationships within the data. This aligns with its linear nature and reliance on simpler
feature interactions. SVM, while performing better than Logistic Regression, achieves
moderate accuracy, reflecting its capability to handle high-dimensional data but also its
sensitivity  to  feature  scaling  and  kernel  selection.  This  comparison  highlights  the
importance  of  combining  feature  selection  techniques,  such  as  those  driven  by  a
Genetic Algorithm, with robust classifiers like Random Forest to maximize predictive
performance. The findings emphasize that Random Forest is the most effective model
for loan approval prediction when paired with an optimized feature subset.

Fig 7. Confusion Matrix of 3 classifiers

The  confusion  matrix  is  used  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  three  classifiers,
Random  Forest,  Logistic  Regression,  and  SVM  in  predicting  loan  approvals  by
categorizing predictions into True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives
(FP), and False Negatives (FN). The results from the confusion matrices indicate that
the Random Forest classifier provides the best balance between precision and recall,
with low false  positives (11)  and  moderate false negatives  (13), making  it  a  reliable
choice for loan approval prediction.  Logistic  Regression  performs well  in  approving
eligible applicants (high true positives: 74) but has a high false positive rate (46), posing
financial risks. SVM achieves the highest recall, with only 1 false negative, ensuring
almost all eligible applicants are approved, but suffers from 47 false positives, making
it unsuitable for strict financial risk management. Overall, Random Forest emerges as
the most balanced and reliable classifier for loan approval prediction in this study.

Conclusion

The  study  concludes  that  Random  Forest,  when  integrated  with  Genetic  Algorithm-
based feature selection, is the most effective classifier for loan approval prediction. It
consistently  achieved  the  highest  accuracy,  precision,  recall,  and  F1  score,
demonstrating its ability  to balance identifying eligible loans while minimizing false
positives and false negatives. This makes it a robust and reliable model for both fairness
and  financial  risk  management.  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  excelled  in  recall,
minimizing the rejection of eligible applicants, making it a suitable choice in scenarios
where  ensuring  fairness  is  a  priority.  However,  its  lower  precision  highlighted
challenges  in  reducing  false  approvals,  which  could increase  financial  risk.  Logistic
Regression, while interpretable and straightforward, underperformed across all metrics,
indicating its limitations in capturing the complex relationships present in the dataset.
The  integration  of  Genetic  Algorithms  for  feature  selection  played  a  critical  role  in
optimizing model performance by identifying the most relevant features, demonstrating
the  importance  of  feature  engineering  in  predictive  modeling.  Ultimately,  this  study
identifies  Random  Forest  as  the  most  balanced  and  reliable  solution,  capable  of
addressing both operational efficiency and equitable loan decision-making processes.

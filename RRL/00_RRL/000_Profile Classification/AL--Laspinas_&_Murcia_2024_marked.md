Abstract
This  study  compares  the  predictive  accuracy  of  six  machine  learning  classifiers  –  Logistic,  Decision  Tree  (J48),
RandomForest, Random Tree, IBk (k-NN), and NaiveBayes – for estimating adult income. Utilizing metrics such as true
positive (TP) rate, false positive (FP) rate, precision, recall, and the F-measure, the performance of these classifiers was
evaluated. Based on the results, RandomForest and Random Tree classifiers demonstrated the highest efficacy across all
metrics.  Nonetheless,  other  classifiers,  such  as  Decision  Tree  and  IBk,  demonstrated  promise,  especially  when  the
parameters  were  modified.  The  findings  highlight  the  importance  of  model  selection  and  fine-tuning  in  predictive
modeling.  These  findings  have  significant  ramifications  for  income  forecasting,  highlighting  the  capacity  of  machine
learning  to  facilitate  accurate  socioeconomic  forecasting.  The  study's  results  provide  vital  guidance  for  deploying  the
most appropriate classifier based on the specifics of the income dataset and the prediction task.

INTRODUCTION
The  introduction  of  machine  learning  (ML)  in  economic  analysis  represents  a  significant  change  from  traditional
is  based  on  the
econometric  methods
acknowledgement of the inherent constraints of conventional models in comprehending the complex dynamics of income
distribution. The classification and prediction of income levels have become crucial tasks due to the growing intricacy of
global  economic  systems  (Bandeira-Morais,  Swart  &  Jordaan,  2021).  Conventional  models,  which are  bound  by  linear
assumptions  and  a  restricted  capacity  to  analyze  complex  data,  sometimes  fall  short  in  accurately  or  comprehensively
explaining income differences (Yuan & Ling, 2020; Gelman, Hill & Vehtari, 2020). On the other hand, machine learning
techniques  provide  a  hopeful  alternative  that  may  effectively  analyze  large  datasets  and  reveal  intricate  patterns  that
impact  economic  groups  (Athey,  2018).  This  methodological  development  has  repercussions  that  go  beyond  academic
interest. It has major effects on policy making and socio-economic planning.

transformation

Econometric models have historically been fundamental to economic analysis, providing useful insights into the
factors that contribute to differences in income. Nevertheless, Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011) have highlighted that
these models are hindered by their dependence on linear associations and a limited range of factors, which may obfuscate
the complex dynamics of income distribution. This critique emphasizes a significant deficiency in conventional methods,
specifically their incapacity to effectively handle the non-linear and diverse nature of economic data. The constraints of
econometric models are most apparent when addressing the intricate interaction of variables that influence income levels,
ranging from regional economic circumstances to worldwide market dynamics.

There is an increasing agreement among scholars that a new analytical framework is necessary in order to better
understand and represent the actual economic inequalities. The incorporation of machine learning into the examination of

92

income  levels  presents  a  revolutionary  method  that  can  effectively  tackle  the  limitations  of  conventional  econometric
models.  Delen,  Oztekin,  and  Kong  (2010)  have  showcased  the  capacity  of  machine  learning  algorithms  to  detect  non-
linear  associations  and  previously  undiscovered  indicators  of  income,  providing  a  more  dynamic  comprehension  of
economic inequalities. The ability to do detailed analysis is reinforced by the studies of Atkeson and Kehoe (2001) and
Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), who highlight the capability of machine learning to effectively process intricate
and multidimensional datasets. Through the utilization of machine learning techniques, researchers are able to surpass the
limitations  of  traditional  models,  thereby  gaining  access  to  fresh  perspectives  on  the  variables  that  impact  income
distribution. This, in turn, establishes a stronger and more reliable basis for economic predictions.

The significance of machine learning in predicting income levels is emphasized by the increasing apprehension
regarding income disparity at both the global and local levels. In his study, Milanovic (2016) illuminates the increasing
disparity between the most affluent and least privileged communities worldwide, a phenomenon that presents substantial
obstacles to both societal unity and long-term progress. In the Philippines, income disparities have a significant impact on
economic  growth,  social  mobility,  and  general  societal  well-being  (Dacuycuy,  2019),  making  the  situation  particularly
severe (Kelley  &  Evans,  2017). Moreover,  scholars  such  as  Ostry  et  al.  (2014) and  Beck,  Demirgüç-Kunt,  and  Levine
(2007) have emphasized the negative effects of excessive income disparity, emphasizing the importance of accurate, data-
based analysis to guide policy decisions and foster fair growth.

The research disparity refers to the inadequate utilization of machine learning methods in predicting the income
levels of adults. The objective of this study is to create a sophisticated predictive model that can accurately analyze and
incorporate complicated income patterns. This will be achieved by combining global, national, and local data sources with
advanced algorithms. Utilizing machine learning techniques can improve our understanding of the factors that determine
income and increase the accuracy of income predictions. This study aims to rectify this insufficiency by contributing to
the existing body of knowledge on income prediction through the utilization of machine learning techniques.

This  study  makes  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  field  of  economic  research  by  utilizing  machine  learning
techniques  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  and  precise  analysis  of  income  levels  and  inequalities.  By  utilizing  the
findings of previous studies (e.g., Alejandrino, Bolacoy, & Murcia, 2023; Biol & Murcia, 2024; Credit, 2022; Ngai, Xiu,
& Chau, 2009), all who have demonstrated the enhanced prediction precision of machine learning (ML) models compared
to conventional statistical approaches, this study not only contributes to academic knowledge but also offers a useful tool
for  policymakers.  The  utilization  of  machine  learning  to  precisely  categorize  and  forecast  income  levels  presents
opportunities  for  focused  interventions,  facilitating  the  efficient  distribution  of  resources  and  the  development  of
strategies to diminish income disparity and promote comprehensive economic expansion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dataset
The Adult Income Prediction dataset (Patki, n.d.), which is readily accessible on the Kaggle platform, is a vast collection
of  demographic  and  employment-related  information.  Its  primary  objective  is  to  facilitate  research  and  forecasting  of
adult  income  levels.  Due  to  its  diverse  set  of  characteristics,  it  provides  an  excellent  basis  for  implementing  and
evaluating  machine  learning  techniques  in  the  context  of  income  prediction.  Given  various  socioeconomic  and
demographic factors derived from census data, the real-world nature of the data collection affords a unique opportunity to
determine whether a person's annual income exceeds or falls below $50,000.

The  dataset  has  16,281  observations  or  entries,  each  representing  an  individual.  Each  person  is  described  by  thirteen
distinct  characteristics  or  attributes,  providing  a  multifaceted  view  of  the  population.  These  characteristics  comprise
various  aspects  of  a  person's  existence,  including  age,  occupation,  level  of  education,  and  marital  status.  Variables  of
different  types  -  numeric  and  categorical  -  increase  the  dataset's  diversity,  making  it  optimal  for  complex,  real-world
machine-learning applications.

The target variable, 'Income,' is a crucial component of the dataset. This binary categorical variable indicates whether an
individual's annual income exceeds or falls below $50,000. This dichotomous classification serves as the outcome to be
predicted based on the constellation of other features in the dataset and serves as the basis for predictive modeling efforts.
This  dataset  is  genuinely  distinguished  by  its  rich  variety  of  features,  which  permits  the  training  of  nuanced  machine-
learning models for income forecasting. Due to the comprehensive nature of the data, machine learning models can use it
to identify intricate relationships between demographic and employment-related factors. Therefore, it can provide a more
comprehensive comprehension of their collective and individual effects on a person's income. This dataset offers a unique
opportunity to delve deeper into the predictive analysis of income, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of such
analyses in real-world scenarios.

Feature Selection
Using the Weka software for attribute selection, a systematic analysis of the Adult Income Prediction dataset's attributes
was  conducted  based  on  their  information  gain  and,  consequently,  their  predictive  power.  The  InfoGainAttributeEval
evaluates a feature by calculating the information gain relative to a specific class. On the other hand, the Ranker search
method assigns a rank to an attribute based on its assessed value (Hassan, & Khan, 2017). This combination of techniques
assesses the potential information gain or reduction in entropy if the attribute in question were utilized for prediction. This
evaluation determines the attribute's ability to distinguish data based on the class value, in this case, whether the income is
greater than or less than $50,000.

Upon evaluation, the Ranker method ranks the attributes according to their scores, thereby listing attributes from
most significant to least. As illustrated by our dataset, this classification revealed the 'Relationship' attribute to be the most
predictive  of  income  levels,  with  a  value  of  0.16575.  This  result  is  likely  attributable  to  the  socioeconomic  factors
associated  with  familial  financial  structures  (Martin,  2006).  In  contrast,  characteristics  such  as  'Race'  and  'Native
Country', which scored the lowest at 0.00819 and 0.00901 respectively, manifested less predictive power. The second and
third-ranked  attributes,  'Marital  Status'  and  'Capital  Gain,'  with  scores  of  0.15809  and  0.11337,  respectively,  supported
previous  research  highlighting  the  significant  economic  implications  of  marital  status  (Schoeni,  1995)  and  the  direct
impact  of  a  person's  financial  transactions  and  investments  on  their  income  (Frank,  2010).  Moreover,  occupation
(0.09056), age (0.09521), education (0.08943), hours-per-week (0.05645), capital loss (0.04937), sex (0.03572), and work
class  (0.02423)  were  also  ranked.  This  method  emphasizes  the  significance  of  attribute  selection  in  augmenting  the
effectiveness, interpretability, and precision of predictive models.

Data Classification and Cross-Validation
In  the  context  of  the  Adult  Income  Prediction  study,  four  prominent  classifiers,  including  decision  trees  (J48)  and
RandomForest,  k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) using Weka's  IBk algorithm, and Naive Bayes, were utilized to classify the
training  data  and  predict  the  class  label  within  the  test  set.  In  addition  to  these  classifiers,  Logistic  Regression  was
employed due to its effectiveness in binary predictions, which corresponds to the binary character of income levels in this
data set.

J48 decision trees and k-NN classifiers were tuned for their parameters. Adjustments were made to the confidence
factor, which is essential for post-pruning efficacy. The investigation involved executing the J48 classifier with 0.25, 0.5,
and 0.75 confidence values. For k-NN, the value of k, the number of nearest neighbors, was modified in order to decrease
error  probabilities  (Dudani,  1976).  The  analysis  was  conducted  with  k  values  of  3,  5,  7,  and  9  because  it  is  widely
accepted that the efficacy of k-NN improves ask increases (Alejandrino et al., 2023).

The classifier was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, a technique that guarantees a balanced and unbiased
estimation  of  model  performance  (Kohavi,  1995).  This  method  divides  the  data  into  ten  subsets,  uses  nine  subsets  for
training and one for testing iteratively, and then averages the performance measures.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In  this  study,  the  classification  performance  of  various  machine  learning  classifiers  was  assessed  utilizing  the  Adult
Income  Prediction  dataset.  Six  classifiers,  which  includes  Logistic,  J48  (a  decision  tree  classifier),  Random  Forest,
Random Tree, IBk (representing k-NN), and NaiveBayes, were selected based on their widespread use and demonstrated
efficacy  in  similar  studies.  To  ensure  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  model's  predictive  accuracy,  a  total  of  11
classification tests were conducted, with results displayed in Table 2.

The evaluation of the classification precision of the selected classifiers in predicting the income level of the Adult
Income Prediction dataset revealed that the models provided varying degrees of accuracy. The accuracy of Logistic was
85.82%,  correctly  classifying  13,923  instances.  This  result  is  consistent  with  Peng,  Lee,  and  Ingersoll’s  (2002)  earlier
finding,  demonstrating  that  Logistic  is  an  effective  classifier  for  binary  outcomes.  Meanwhile,  the  accuracy  of  the  J48
decision tree classifier improved as the confidence level increased when tested with three distinct confidence levels. Tests
results revealed accuracy of 87.21%, 88.96%, and 90.84% for confidence levels of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, respectively. This
result suggests that a higher confidence level may improve the efficacy of the classifier (Rajesh & Karthikeyan, 2017).

In addition, the table shows that the Random Forest classifier and the Random Tree classifier demonstrated the
effectiveness  of  ensemble  methods  in  improving  prediction  accuracy  (Liaw  &  Wiener,  2002).  The  Random  Forest
classifier  and the  Random  Tree  classifier  achieved  accuracy  levels  of  98.35%  and  98.37%, respectively.  Similarly,  the

94

IBk algorithm, which represents the k-NN method, was evaluated with k values of 3, 5, 7, and 9. It produced accuracy
rates ranging from 89.11% (k=3) to 85.74 % (k=9), indicating an optimal range of k values for this particular dataset, in
contrast to earlier research that suggested an increase in accuracy with higher k values (Alejandrino et al., 2023). Lastly,
the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier was 82.24%. Despite having the lowest accuracy among the tested classifiers,
Naive Bayes remains a popular option due to its simplicity and effectiveness with large data sets (John & Langley, 1995

false  positive  rate,  precision,  recall,  and  the  F-measure.  Table  3  displays  the  specific  results  of  this  performance
evaluation. The results of the performance evaluation of the six classifiers provide significant insights into the behaviors
and characteristics of various classification models, which have practical applications.

With F-measures of 0.983 and 0.984, respectively, the RandomForest and Random Tree classifiers have been observed to
have  the  highest  performance.  These  high  scores  suggest  that  these  classifiers  were  able  to  establish  a  good  balance
between precision and recall, thereby reducing both the false-positive and false-negative rates. This is a strong indication
that  the  models  were  able  to  generalize  well  from  the  training  data  and  accurately  predict  the  class  labels  of  new,
unobserved data.

The high performance of the RandomForest classifier may be attributed to the ensemble nature of this classifier,
which is intended to enhance the overall result by minimizing overfitting. Similarly, the Random Tree classifier benefited
from random feature selection, which contributed to its robust performance (Zhou et al., 2020). The robust performance
of both classifiers suggests that they will likely be dependable for other classification tasks.  In a  variety of application
domains where precision is of the utmost importance, their sturdiness makes them a secure option.

As  indicated  by  the  F-measure,  the  Decision  Tree  (J48)  classifier  exhibits  a  trend  in  which  increasing  the
confidence  factor  (C)  leads  to  decreased  performance.  This  indicates  that  a  larger  confidence  factor  may  result  in
overfitting,  in  which  the  model  becomes  overly  complex  and  performs  well  on  training  data  but  unfavorably  on
unobserved data.

Looking on the results of the  k-nearest neighbors (IBk) classifier, efficacy diminishes as neighborhood size (k)
increases.  This  may  suggest  that  larger  k  values  incorporate  more  disturbance  into  the  classification  process,  as  more
distant neighbors (who may belong to other classes) are considered (Franco-Lopez, Ek & Bauer, 2001). This suggests that
a smaller neighborhood size may be preferable when the dataset contains classes with complex or irregular boundaries.

The average performance of the Logistic classifier may be attributable to the nature of logistic regression, which
implies a linear decision boundary and may not perform well if the actual decision boundary is non-linear. Finally, despite
its  simplicity  and  the  assumption  of  feature  independence,  the  Naive  Bayes  classifier  performs  comparably  to  the  J48
decision tree classifier with a confidence level of 0.75.

95

The results demonstrate that there is no universal classifier and that the selection of a classifier should be based on the
task and dataset at hand. Moreover, significant number of scholars (e.g., Blachnik, 2017; Telikani et al., 2021; Yapp et al.,
2020;  Zhang  et  al.,  2020)  emphasize  the  significance  of  evaluating  multiple  classifiers  and  adjusting  hyperparameters,
such as the confidence factor in the Decision Tree classifier and the neighborhood size in the k-NN classifier, in order to
find the model that best satisfies the task's particular requirements. Due to their inherent ability to prevent overfitting and
consistently high performance (Aria, Cuccurullo & Gnasso, 2021; Kunapuli, 2023; Zhou, 2012), ensemble methods, such
as RandomForest and Random Tree, may be an excellent starting point for many tasks.

CONCLUSION
This study concludes with crucial insights regarding the use of machine learning classifiers for estimating adult income
levels. RandomForest and Random Tree classifiers demonstrated superior precision, recall, and F-measure performance,
indicating  their  suitability  for this task.  Nevertheless,  the  performance  of J48  Decision Tree  and  IBk  classifiers,  which
could be altered by modifying parameters, demonstrates the adaptability that these models can offer. Even the simplicity
of the NaiveBayes classifier can be useful for income level prediction, producing competitive results. Although Logistic
algorithm's performance was average, it should not be undervalued for certain categories of income datasets. Ultimately,
the selection of the optimal machine learning classifier for predicting adult income is dependent on the dataset and the
task. These results highlight the significance of meticulous model selection and refining in the development of accurate
and reliable adult income prediction models.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The  current  study  highlights  the  profound  capacity  of  machine  learning  (ML)  methods  to  improve  the  accuracy  of
classifying income levels, which has important implications for economic research and policy development. The strong
evidence  produced  by  using  classifiers  like  Random  Forest  and  Random  Tree,  which  are  renowned  for  their  high
precision and capability to handle intricate data structures, indicates that policymakers and economic researchers should
incorporate  these advanced  machine  learning  algorithms  into  their analytical frameworks.  By  engaging  in  this  process,
individuals can acquire a more profound comprehension of the complex mechanisms that dictate the allocation of income
and detect subtle patterns that conventional econometric models may fail to recognize. This method not only simplifies
the process of creating more focused and efficient socio-economic policies, but also assists in devising measures to reduce
income inequalities. Therefore, harnessing the predictive capabilities of machine learning could have a crucial impact on
promoting economic fairness and facilitating sustainable development.

This study presents various avenues that should be further investigated in future research. Firstly, it is necessary
to examine the suitability of these machine learning classifiers in various economic settings and datasets, thus confirming
their  adaptability  and  reliability  in  forecasting  income  levels.  Additionally,  by  fine-tuning  the  parameters  of  the
classifiers,  it  is  possible  to  achieve  even  greater  levels  of  predicted  accuracy.  This  implies  that  investing  efforts  in
optimizing hyperparameters could lead to substantial benefits. Furthermore, incorporating supplementary socio-economic
factors and implementing a more detailed method of classifying income could improve the models' ability to detect minor
economic  patterns  and  changes.  Finally,  integrating  machine  learning  with  knowledge  from  behavioral  economics,
sociology, and psychology can offer a comprehensive perspective on the factors that impact income levels. This can lead
to  the  creation  of  detailed  and  sophisticated  economic  models.  Participating  in  these  research  activities  will  not  only
progress  the  discipline  of  economic  analysis  but  also  aid  in  the  development  of  policies  that  better  tackle  the  intricate
concerns of income inequality and economic diversity.

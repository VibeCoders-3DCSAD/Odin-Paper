Student dropout remains a persistent challenge in higher education, particularly in developing regions where
institutional  resources  for  intervention  are  limited.  This  study  explores  the  predictive  potential  of  machine
learning  (ML)  algorithms  in  identifying  students  at  risk  of  dropping  out  using  historical  academic  and  socio-
demographic data from Mindanao State University–Main Campus, covering a ten-year period (2012–2022). A
total of 482 student records and 146 variables were preprocessed using Power BI and prepared via the CRISP-DM
methodology before being modeled in Jupyter Notebook. Ten ML algorithms such asExtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF),
Multilayer  Perceptron  (MLP),  Logistic  Regression  (LR),  K-Nearest  Neighbor  (KNN),  Support  Vector  Machine
(SVM),  and  Naïve  Bayes (NB)  were  evaluated  using both  train-test  split  and  5-fold  cross-validation to  ensure
robustness  and  generalizability.  Results  indicate  that  XGBoost  outperformed  all  other  models,  achieving  the
highest cross-validated accuracy (90.66 %), F1 Score (90.72), and one of the lowest error values (Mean Square
Error  (MSE) = 9.34, Log Loss = 0.26). GB and ANN followed closely, demonstrating strong balance between
precision, recall, and low misclassification rates. While models like Naïve Bayes recorded high recall, they also
produced  excessive  false  positives,  limiting  their  practical  use.  The  study  offers  a  scalable  and  transferable
modeling  framework  for  higher  education  institutions  seeking  to  implement  early  warning  systems.  It  also
emphasizes the pedagogical value of integrating educational data science into Information Technology Education
(ITE) curricula to foster real-world AI application. Limitations and future directions are discussed, particularly
regarding behavioral data integration and model interpretability.

1. Introduction

Student  attrition  in  university  settings  has  long  been  a  pressing
concern among educators and administrators, as it significantly affects
institutional  rankings,  reputation,  workforce  readiness,  and  financial
sustainability  [1,2].  Globally,  high  dropout  rates  are  associated  with
wasted  educational  resources,  decreased  graduation  outputs,  and
weakened national educational goals. In many developing and under-
represented contexts, particularly in Southeast Asia, challenges related
to academic persistence are compounded by socioeconomic disparities

and infrastructure limitations. A wide range of factors contribute to a
student’s decision to withdraw from a program, but academic perfor-
mance and sociodemographic characteristics remain the most frequently
examined variables in retention studies [3,4].

In response to this challenge, Educational Data Mining (EDM) has
emerged  as  a  key  area  within  educational  research,  focusing  on  the
application of machine learning techniques to institutional data in order
to  predict  student  outcomes  and  inform  strategic  interventions  [5].
Numerous  studies  have  established  that  academic  records  and  de-
mographic profiles are strong indicators of student persistence or risk of

dropout  [3,4,6].  The  integration  of  EDM  and  machine  learning  into
university  systems  allows  institutions—both  locally  and  globally—to
analyze historical student data to identify learning gaps, anticipate ac-
ademic  failures,  and  predict  future  academic  trajectories  [7].  These
predictive  insights  can  guide  data-informed  decisions  aimed  at
improving  institutional  effectiveness and  creating supportive  learning
environments  [8],  ultimately  helping  students  stay  on  track  toward
timely graduation.

The  College  of  Information  and  Computing  Sciences  (CICS)  of
Mindanao  State  University  –  Main  Campus  has  one  of  the  highest
attrition rates within the university, which piqued the researcher’s in-
terest in this subject matter. However, the significance of this research
extends far beyond the boundaries of one institution. As higher educa-
tion  institutions  worldwide  contend  with  increased  student  diversity,
massification of enrollment, and post-pandemic educational disruptions,
the ability to accurately model and address student attrition becomes a
global imperative. Retention metrics are now pivotal not just for insti-
tutional  planning but also for  national education performance bench-
marks, accreditation compliance, and international university rankings.
Moreover, diversity and inclusion goals, particularly disaggregated
retention statistics by gender, socio-economic status, and ethnicity, have
gained prominence as critical indicators of how well institutions support
marginalized student populations. These data-driven approaches offer
powerful tools to inform not only curriculum design and student services
but  also  equitable  resource  distribution  and  strategic  policy  develop-
ment. On a global scale, retention and graduation rates are among the
most  scrutinized  indicators  by  ranking  bodies  and  education  quality
assurance  agencies,  making  predictive  analytics  in  this  domain  both
timely and globally significant.

Recent  studies  apply  diverse predictive  models  for  predicting aca-
demic  performance,  graduation,  and  dropout  [9],  enabled  by  the
increasing availability of institutional datasets. As model performance
depends heavily on dataset quality and size [10], large-scale research
such  as  that  by  Alhazmi  &  Sheneamer  [11]  (275,000  students)  and
Rodríguez-Hern´andez  et  al.  [12]  (162,030  students)  reinforces  the
reliability of data-driven modeling. Several others, Beckham et al. [13],
Niyogisubizo et al. [14], Ghorbani & Ghousi [15], Marbouti et al. [16],
Lam et al. [17], and Gonzalez-Nucamendi et al. [18], explore the pre-
dictive power of various machine learning models, including hybrid and
ensemble  approaches,  in  student  dropout  forecasting  across  countries
such as Portugal, Colombia, Iran, and Mexico. These global efforts un-
derscore the importance of localized yet scalable modeling approaches,
especially for contexts with high dropout risk but low representation in
existing literature.

This  study  makes  several  key  contributions  to  the  field  of  student
retention  analytics.  First,  it  integrates  a  comprehensive  set  of  socio-
demographic and academic variables to develop predictive models for
student  retention  within  the  context  of  a  state  university  in  the
Philippines, an underrepresented setting in existing literature. Second, it
conducts a rigorous comparative evaluation of ten (10) widely adopted
machine  learning  (ML)  algorithms,  identifying  Extreme  Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) as the most accurate across multiple standardized
metrics. Third, the study leverages actual student data spanning a full
decade  (2012–2022)  from  the  College  of  Information  and  Computing
Sciences  (CICS)  at  Mindanao  State  University–Main  Campus,  encom-
passing its Computer Science, Information Technology, and Information
Systems programs. This longitudinal dataset enables deeper insights into
student  behavior  and  retention  trends  over  time,  supporting  more
effective early intervention strategies.

The novelty of this research lies in its context-specific focus, breadth
of model comparison, and practical implementation using institutional
data  visualized  through  Python  in  a  Jupyter  Notebook  environment.
While the effectiveness of ML in predicting student performance is well-
established, much of the existing literature relies on short-term datasets,
simulated  environments,  or  limited  algorithm  selection.  Some  studies
also  emphasize  hybrid  model  development  without  conducting

systematic benchmarking. In contrast, this study addresses these gaps by
employing ten ML models evaluated using six performance metrics such
as Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Mean Squared Error (MSE), log
loss, and by conducting a thorough review to identify the most relevant
data inputs and modeling strategies.

Ultimately,  the  goal  of  this  research  is  not  only  to  achieve  high
predictive  performance  but  also  to  provide  actionable  insights  that
inform institutional policy, guide academic interventions, and support
program-level strategies to reduce student attrition and improve timely
graduation rates. By  contributing findings  from a region  with limited
representation in literature, this study aims to support more inclusive
and globally relevant approaches to student success analytics.

2. Material and methods

In  conducting  the  study,  secondary  data  of  CICS  students  was
sourced from the Information and Communication Technology Center
(ICTC), following the guidelines established by the Preferred Reporting
Items  for  Systematic  Reviews and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA).  The data
underwent  the  CRISP-DM  process.  First,  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the
business objectives and needs was done. Next, the quality of gathered
data was examined and cleaned. Subsequently, the data was organized
for modeling. Ten (10) data modeling techniques were applied to predict
the outcomes which were then evaluated using six (6) evaluation met-
rics  to  identify  the  optimal  model  that  provides  the  most  accurate
results.

2.1. Systematic review

2.1.1. Data collection and extraction

For the systematic review, two (2) journal databases were used to
find the recent and relevant articles necessary to conduct the systematic
review. To find the relevant papers, the researcher used the keywords
“Data mining”  AND “Student retention”  OR “Student performance”  in
Science  Direct  and  “Predicting  student  retention”  + “data  mining”  in
IEEE Xplore. Furthermore, the search was filtered to restrict the publi-
cation year between 2013 and 2023 spanning ten (10) years; this was to
ensure that all selected papers are relevant and up to date. The query
resulted in a total of 364 journals (see Table 1). Subsequently, MS Excel
was used to organize, sort, and eliminate duplicates from the retrieved
data set

2.1.2. PRISMA model

In this process as illustrated in Fig. 1, 336 records were excluded in
the screening process due to its irrelevancy based on their title and ab-
stract. The remaining articles were then assessed for eligibility based on
the  criteria  listed  in  Table  2 by  reviewing  them  in  full  text,  and  this
assessment retained 21 studies listed in Table 3 .

2.1.3. Key findings

Fig.  2a  illustrates  the  frequency  with  which  various  sociodemo-
graphic factors were utilized across a set of studies. The data reveals that
gender (9 studies) was the most frequently used factor, followed closely
by marital status (8 studies) and age (7 studies). These results suggest
that these variables are considered highly relevant in research exploring

social or behavioral outcomes. Other moderately used factors include
parent’s  occupation  (4  studies),  family  size  and  financial  support  (3
studies  each),  and  guardian  and  parent’s  education/qualification  (2
studies each). Several factors, such as address, family responsibilities,
religious affiliation, parent’s school issues, school, travel time to school,
and working status, were only used in a single study, indicating limited
application or relevance in most contexts analyzed. Further, this varia-
tion in usage frequency highlights a trend in which basic demographic
variables  like gender, age, and marital status are prioritized, possibly
due to their availability, perceived impact, or ease of interpretation in
predictive modeling and statistical analyses.

On the other hand, Fig. 2b depicts presents the frequency with which
specific  academic-related  variables  were  included  across  different
research studies. The most used academic factor was expected gradua-
tion year (n = 8), followed by grades or GPA (n = 7) and project grades
(n = 7). These variables likely reflect students’ academic performance
and trajectory, making them strong predictors in educational analytics.

Other  academic  factors  with  moderate  usage  include  admission  test
score (n = 4), dropout status (n = 3), and high school GPA and year level
(n = 3 each). Several variables such as enrollment status, student clas-
sification,  socioemotional  support,  transfer  status,  and  middle  school
performance  were  only  used  in  one  or  two  studies,  indicating  lower
prevalence or relevance depending on the study’s objectives. Moreover,
the  variety  in  factor  usage  suggests  that  while  some  indicators  like
grades and graduation timelines are central to academic studies, others
are context-dependent and possibly underexplored. This also highlights
an opportunity to investigate the value of less commonly used academic
variables in future predictive or evaluative studies.

Fig.  2c  shows  the  frequency  of  usage  of  various machine  learning
(ML) models in the studies, distinguishing between supervised and un-
supervised learning methods. It is evident that Decision Tree (n = 8),
Multilayer  Perceptron  (MLP)  (n  = 8),  and  Support  Vector  Machine
(SVM)  (n  = 8)  are  the  most  widely  used  supervised  learning  models,
reflecting  their  popularity  due  to  interpretability,  accuracy,  and
robustness  in  classification  tasks.  Other  frequently  applied  models
include Logistic Regression (n = 6) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) (n =
5). These classical models are still highly valued for their simplicity and
effectiveness. Less frequently used models, each appearing in just one
study, include Bayesian Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), among others. Notably, only a
few models were classified under unsupervised learning (in gray), such
as K-Means Clustering (n = 2) and J48/JRip, indicating a predominant
focus on supervised techniques in the reviewed studies. This highlights a
potential  research  gap  where  unsupervised  or  hybrid  learning  ap-
proaches could be further explored.

Fig. 2d illustrates the frequency of various evaluation metrics used
across studies related to predictive modeling. Accuracy emerges as the

most  employed  metric,  reported  in  13  studies,  highlighting  its  popu-
larity  due  to  its  simplicity  and  intuitive  interpretation.  Following
closely,  F1  Score,  Precision,  and  Recall  are  each  used  in  11  studies.
These  three  metrics  are  especially  important  in  imbalanced  datasets
where focusing solely on accuracy could be misleading. Other metrics
such as MSE (used in 2 studies) and a range of others (each used once) —
including ROC curve, R2, AUC, MAE, and RMSE — suggest that while
diversity  exists  in  evaluation  practices,  there  is  a  clear  concentration
around  a  few  key  indicators.  This  trend  may  reflect  a  preference  for
metrics  that  balance  interpretability  with  robustness,  especially  in
classification  tasks.  Interestingly,  statistical  tests  like  the  Hosmer  &
Lemeshow test, Wald test, and Likelihood Ratio Test, though rarely used
(only once each), indicate occasional application of inferential statistical
methods to complement predictive accuracy. This distribution provides
insight  into  how  performance  is  validated  in  student  retention  and

academic prediction models, pointing to a need for more consistent use
of  varied  and  task-appropriate  evaluation  metrics  to  ensure  balanced
model assessment.

2.2. CRISP-DM

The  Cross-Industry  Standard  Process  for  Data  Mining  (CRISP-DM)
(Fig. 3) is widely adopted, industry - independent process model for data
mining, extensively used in both practical applications and in research
[34]. This cycle is composed of six phases: (1) Business Understanding
which  focuses  on  the  understanding  of  the  project  objectives  and  re-
quirements  from  a  business  perspective;  (2)  Data  Understanding  or
determining the data to be collected and discovering insights from it; (3)
Data Preparation which encompasses all activities that result in the final
dataset; (4) Modeling, where various modeling techniques are chosen

selected were tested by setting the X and Y variables, then dividing the
dataset into training and testing data. After that, the models were built
for prediction using the test data.

In the evaluation stage, the algorithms were tested using the selected
six  (6)  evaluation  metrics  to  calculate  the  accuracy  of  the  predicted
values.  The  model  with  highest  accuracy  rate  was  the  algorithm
deployed  for  the  final  prediction  of  student’s  probability  rate  of
withdrawal.

2.3. Machine learning algorithms

In predictive analytics, ML algorithms are essential tools for identi-
fying trends and patterns in educational data, particularly in modeling
student retention. These algorithms must first be trained on historical
data to ensure accurate predictions and can be categorized into classi-
fication,  ensemble,  and  neural  network  models.  Classification  algo-
rithms  such  as  SVM  [37],  Logistic  Regression  [22],  KNN  [38],  Naïve
Bayes [39], and Decision Tree [37] are widely used to label students as
either  at  risk  or  likely  to  persist,  each  with  varying  assumptions  and
sensitivities to educational data structures. SVM and LR assume Inde-
pendent  and  Identically  Distributed  (IID)  data,  though  LR  can  be
adapted  using  generalized  estimating  equations  (GEE)  to  account  for
clustered  errors.  KNN  is  a  non-parametric  model  sensitive  to  de-
mographic  clustering,  while  Naïve  Bayes,  despite  its  strong  indepen-
dence  assumption,  remains  useful  in  large  datasets  when  paired  with
feature selection. Decision Trees are intuitive and flexible but prone to
overfitting without pruning. Ensemble models like Random Forest and
Gradient Boosting [14] combine multiple learners to improve accuracy
and generalization [18], with Random Forest offering simplicity, short
training time, and improved forecasting accuracy, albeit with increased
model complexity as more trees are added [19]. XGBoost, an optimized
implementation of gradient boosting, has emerged as a leading model
due to its speed, built-in regularization, early stopping, and ability to
handle  structured  and  nested  data  using  parameters  such  as  “group”
[14]. The heterogeneity among ensemble learners helps mitigate bias
and variance, making them robust in handling diverse student profiles
[40].

Moreover, Neural network models are powerful algorithms inspired
by  the  structure  and  function  of  the  human  brain.  They  process  data
through  interconnected  layers  of  artificial  neurons,  enabling  the
learning of non-linear relationships and adaptive weight adjustments.
These models are particularly effective for complex prediction tasks in
EDM environments [41]. One common variant is the ANN, which con-
sists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
Each artificial neuron receives inputs, computes weighted sums, applies
activation  functions,  and  passes  outputs  to  the  next  layer.  During
training, these weights are adjusted iteratively to minimize prediction
error. ANNs are widely applied in EDM because they can model intricate
relationships between variables, even with small datasets, and capture
subtle patterns in student data [28]. While standard ANN architectures
assume IID data, educational datasets often include correlated or nested
structures. To address this, methods such as recurrent architectures for
time-series  data  and  dropout  layers  for  regularization  are  frequently
used. Another variant, the MLP, expands on the ANN by incorporating
multiple  hidden  layers,  enabling  deeper  representation  learning.  An
MLP typically includes an input layer for features, one or more hidden
layers for transformation, and an output layer that produces classifica-
tion  or  regression  outputs.  MLPs  are  particularly  useful  for  solving
prediction  tasks  related  to  academic  performance and  retention [26].
Like  other  neural  models,  MLPs  assume  IID  inputs,  and  thus  pre-
processing  steps  such  as  batch  normalization  or  the  integration  of

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) suffer intensely from students’
withdrawal  as  they  are  highly  interested  and  invested  in  producing
competent students which could positively affect their reputation in the
market. The College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS) in
MSU-Main Campus is not an exemption as most of the enrolled students
took 5 years or more to pass and complete the program (shown in Fig. 4).
Seemingly, half of the overall population from A.Y. 2012–2022 opted to
withdraw from the course and shift to other college to graduate early.

For data preparation stage, the data gathered from the Information
and Communication Technology Center (ICTC) through the permission
of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (OVCAA) of the
Mindanao State University-Marawi (MSU-Main Campus) was inspected
and cleaned where data was corrected, and null and erroneous values
were imputed with zero (0). The multiple files were then integrated in a
single  file.  Afterwards,  the  categorical  data  was  transformed  into  nu-
merical to perform the data analysis without difficulty, and the unnec-
essary attributes and period were excluded in the final dataset that was
fed into the models used.

2.4. Evaluation metrics

To assess the performance of the machine learning models used in
this study, six evaluation metrics were employed: Accuracy, Precision,
Recall, F1 Score, MSE, and log loss. Accuracy measures the proportion of
correctly predicted instances, both positive and negative, relative to the
total number of predictions, offering a general sense of model perfor-
mance,  especially  in  balanced  datasets  [42].  Precision  quantifies  the
number  of  correctly  predicted  positive  cases  out  of  all  instances  pre-
dicted  as  positive,  thereby  reflecting  the  model’s  ability  to  minimize
false positives. In contrast, Recall, or sensitivity, evaluates the model’s
capacity to identify all relevant positive instances, making it crucial in
contexts  where  missing  at-risk  students  has  significant  consequences.
The  F1  Score,  which  is  the  harmonic  mean  of  Precision  and  Recall,
provides a balanced assessment when there is a trade-off between the
two, and is especially useful in handling imbalanced educational data
[43]. Moreover, MSE is applied to measure the average squared differ-
ence between actual and predicted values in regression-based outputs,
with lower values indicating more accurate models. Lastly, the log loss,
used to evaluate the performance of probabilistic classification where
lower  log  loss  indicates  better  performance.  These  metrics  together
enable  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  classification  and  regression
performance in predicting student retention outcomes.

2.5. Modeling setup

All machine learning models were implemented using Python 3.10 in
a  Jupyter  Notebook  environment.  The  following  libraries  were  used:
pandas  for  data  preprocessing,  scikit-learn  for  model  training  and
evaluation,  xgboost  for  gradient  boosting  implementation,  and  mat-
plotlib/seaborn for visualization. To ensure robustness in model evalu-
ation, a 5-fold cross-validation approach was adopted using KFold from
the scikit-learn library. This method randomly splits the dataset into five
equally sized folds. For each iteration, four folds were used to train the
model while the remaining fold was used for validation. This process
was repeated five times so that each data point served as a validation
sample  once.  The  use  of  cross-validation  reduces  the  likelihood  of
overfitting and ensures the generalizability of results. Hyperparameter
tuning was done manually for transparency, and all models were eval-
uated  using  the  six  standard  metrics  described  in  Section  2.4.  No
mathematical  derivations  were  included,  as  this  study  focuses  on  the
applied implementation of machine learning for institutional decision
support in student retention.

2.6. Dataset description

The dataset utilized in this study comprises 482 anonymized student
records drawn from the Information Technology Education (ITE) pro-
gram at Mindanao State University –  Main Campus across curriculum
(see Table 4). It contains 146 variables, meticulously curated to repre-
sent  a  comprehensive  view  of  each  student’s  academic  journey,

serve as predictive inputs for modeling student retention outcomes, with
the DROPOUT variable encoded as a binary target (0 = retained, 1 =
withdrawn).

The dataset is entirely complete, containing no missing values, which
enhances  its  integrity  for  robust  machine  learning  applications.  The
feature set is composed of two primary categories: (1) sociodemographic
attributes, such as AGE, SEX, CITY, PROVINCE, CIVILSTATUS, MOTH-
ERINCOME, and FATHERINCOME, which provide insight into the stu-
dents’  geographic  and  economic  contexts;  (2)  academic  attributes,
encompassing raw or normalized performance indicators derived from
institutional  grading  systems—examples  include  PED001  to  PED012,
STT071,  and  STT101,  which  likely  correspond  to  core  and  technical
courses  specified  in  the  university’s  prospectus;  and  (3)  program-
specific variables, such as PROGRAM, YEARLEVEL, and COURSE HIS-
TORY, capturing progression within the prescribed BSIT-D track.

These academic features reflect the learning milestones embedded in
the  ITE  curriculum,  such  as  basic  computer  programming  subjects,
mathematics, probability and statistics for computing, data structures.
and advanced database systems. Many of the performance variables are
likely derived from institutional logs and standardized academic met-
rics, normalized within a [0,1] scale, allowing for effective comparison
across subjects and semesters. The inclusion of longitudinal academic
indicators and technical subject coverage enables the model to capture
performance trends critical to predicting attrition.

Furthermore,  the  dataset’s  balanced  class  distribution  (approxi-
mately 50 % dropout, 50 % retained) supports fair model training and
evaluation without the need for resampling or synthetic balancing. The
presence of highly granular features, such as course-level assessments
and  regional  identifiers,  adds  dimensional  richness  to  the  analysis,
enabling  the  exploration  of  intersectional  retention  risks  (e.g.,  by
geographic origin or year level).

This dataset exemplifies the growing intersection between academic
analytics and educational data mining in the Philippine higher educa-
tion landscape. It offers a rare opportunity to apply machine learning
models to real-world academic data with direct implications for insti-
tutional  policy,  early  warning  systems,  and  student  support  in-
terventions. By aligning variable design with curriculum structure and
institutional  reporting  systems,  the  dataset  ensures  both  contextual
relevance and technical rigor for predictive modeling of student reten-
tion  and  also  was  reportedly  used  by  this  study  [44].  The  dataset  is
openly available for public access through CodeOcean [45].

3. Results

This section presents the results of machine learning model assess-
ments conducted on historical data collected over a decade (2012–2022)
from the Information and Communication Technology Center (ICTC) of
Mindanao  State  University-Main  Campus.  The  data  underwent  pre-
processing in Power BI using the CRISP-DM methodology before being
imported into Jupyter Notebook for further analysis. Subsequently, the
dataset was partitioned into X (independent variables) and Y (dependent
variables) and split into training (70 %) and testing (30 %) sets. During
analysis, variables highly correlated with the dependent variable were
identified through Spearman coefficient (ρ or rho) in correlation analysis
(Table  5)  and  subsequently  removed  to  avoid  multicollinearity,

resulting  in  the  retainment  of  79  columns  out  of  the  initial  134.  See
Appendix A for the code of removing multicollinearity.

Fig. 5 illustrates the number of actual and correctly predicted results
by  the  ten  (10)  machine  learning  algorithms.  Results  indicate  that
among  the  evaluated  models,  the  XgBoost  algorithm  achieves  the
highest accuracy, correctly predicting 136 instances when compared to
the actual y-values in the test dataset. This performance is then followed
by the GB and Decision Tree (DT) models, which correctly predicted 134
and 131 instances, respectively, out of a total of 145. Further, the sample
code used to assess the prediction accuracy of XgBoost is listed in Ap-
pendix B. A confusion matrix was also created to quantify correct pre-
dictions for the y-values (Dropout or Non-dropout).

On the other hand, Fig. 6 presents the confusion matrices for each
classification model, while Table 6 provides a comparative summary of
their predictive performance in identifying student dropout. Among the
evaluated models, XGBoost demonstrated the most robust classification
capability, achieving 67 true positives (correctly identified dropouts), 5
false  positives  (non-dropouts  misclassified  as  dropouts),  4  false

negatives (dropouts misclassified as non-dropouts), and 69 true nega-
tives  (correctly  identified  non-dropouts).  These  results  indicate  that
XGBoost achieved the highest overall classification accuracy across both
dropout and retention classes. As a reference, in the standard confusion
matrix  layout,  the  top-left  cell  represents  true  positives,  top-right  in-
dicates false positives, bottom-left corresponds to false negatives, and
bottom-right denotes true negatives.

Close behind XGBoost were the GB and ANN models, both of which
exhibited strong and balanced predictive performance. The GB model
yielded 66 true positives, 6 false positives, 5 false negatives, and 68 true
negatives,  indicating  a  high  degree  of  precision  and  recall.  The  ANN
model achieved 60 true positives, 12 false positives, 5 false negatives,
and  68  true  negatives.  Although  both  models  performed  well,  they
incurred  slightly  higher  misclassification  rates  compared  to  XGBoost.
Nevertheless, GB and ANN demonstrated commendable levels of sensi-
tivity (recall of actual dropouts) and specificity (correct identification of
non-dropouts),  supporting  their  utility  in  retention-related  prediction
tasks.

Table 7 presents the initial evaluation results of ten machine learning
models based on a standard train-test split. The assessment covers key
classification metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score,
as  well  as  error  metrics  like  MSE  and  Log  Loss.  Among  all  models,
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) demonstrated the strongest per-
formance, achieving the highest accuracy (93.79 %), F1 Score (93.88),
and  lowest  MSE  (6.21),  with  a  competitive  Log  Loss  value  of  3.98.
Similarly,  Gradient  Boosting  yielded  high  classification  scores,  with
92.41 % accuracy and 92.52 F1 Score, and matched the lowest Log Loss
value  (3.23),  suggesting  well-calibrated  probability  estimates.  Multi-
layer  Perceptron  (MLP)  and  Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN)  models
also performed strongly, particularly in recall (90.41 % and 93.15 %,
respectively), indicating their sensitivity in identifying students at risk of
withdrawal.

The Decision Tree classifier recorded competitive scores, including a
90.34 % accuracy and 90.54 F1 Score. However, its Log Loss was rela-
tively high at 5.47, suggesting less confidence in its probability estimates
despite good classification performance. Conversely, Naïve Bayes, while
achieving a high recall of 91.78 %, posted the lowest precision (68.37 %)
and the poorest error scores, with the highest MSE (25.52) and Log Loss
(9.45), reflecting a high false positive rate and poor calibration. Support
Vector Machine (SVM) similarly underperformed, with an accuracy of
80.00 %, MSE of 20.00, and a Log Loss of 5.72.

The  addition  of  MSE  and  Log  Loss  in  this  preliminary  evaluation

Assessment scores of each model.

provides  a  more  nuanced  view  of  each  model’s  performance.  While
traditional  classification  metrics  suggest  strong  outcomes,  the  error
metrics, particularly Log Loss, highlight how well each model estimates
class probabilities. A lower Log Loss indicates that the model is not only
predicting correctly but is also confident and accurate in its probability
estimates  [47].  In  this  context,  XGBoost  and  Gradient  Boosting  are
shown to be not just accurate, but also well-calibrated.

However,  these  results  are  derived  from  a  single  train-test  split,
which  may  be  subject  to  sampling  bias  and  overfitting,  especially  in
datasets  with  class  imbalance  or  limited  size  [48].  The observed  per-
formance could therefore be overly optimistic. As such, further valida-
tion using K-Fold cross-validation was performed and is discussed in the
succeeding section to assess the stability and generalizability of these
models.

To address this, 5-fold cross-validation was applied to each model,
offering  a  more  reliable  measure  of  generalization.  When  validated
using this method, as shown in Fig. 7, several models exhibited perfor-
mance  declines.  Notably,  the  Decision  Tree  classifier,  which  initially
recorded over 90 % accuracy, saw a reduction to 84.44 %, with a cor-
responding  drop  in  F1  Score  and  an  increase  in  error  metrics.  This
suggests  that  its  original  performance  was  likely  influenced  by  over-
fitting. Similarly, XGBoost, while still the top performer, experienced a
slight reduction in accuracy to 90.66 % and a modest increase in error,
reflecting  a  more  realistic  estimate  of  its  predictive  strength.  Naïve
Bayes continued to display high recall but was again marked by poor
precision and increased error, further confirming its tendency to over-
predict positive cases. In contrast, models such as Random Forest, Lo-
gistic  Regression,  and  Multilayer  Perceptron  maintained  relatively
consistent  performance  across  both  evaluation  strategies,  suggesting
more stable generalization.

These results underscore the necessity of employing cross-validation
techniques  when  evaluating  machine  learning  models,  especially  in
sensitive domains like education. While initial single-split evaluations
are  useful  for  exploratory  comparisons,  they  do  not  account  for  vari-
ability and are prone to optimistic bias. Cross-validation mitigates these
risks  by  ensuring  each  data  point  contributes  to  both  training  and
testing,  resulting  in  more  robust  and  generalizable  performance
estimates.

Furthermore  cross-validation  revealed  meaningful  differences  in
model  performance,  correcting  overestimations  observed  in  pre-
validation results. The XGBoost model remained the most reliable and
consistent across all metrics, reinforcing its suitability for deployment in
early warning systems aimed at reducing student attrition. These find-
ings  highlight  the  importance  of  rigorous  validation  when  applying
predictive analytics to educational decision-making.

4. Discussion

Student  retention  continues  to  be  a  persistent  challenge  in  higher
education,  with  significant  implications  for  institutional  rankings,
reputational standing, and financial sustainability. As such, it remains a
widely  studied  area  in  academic  literature.  Traditional  approaches

Fig. 7. Model performance based on classification and error metrics (5-fold cross-validation). This figure compares ten machine learning models using classification
metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (left panel), alongside error metrics, MSE and log loss (right panel), evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Among
the models, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) achieved the highest accuracy (90.66 %), F1 score (90.72), and one of the lowest error values (MSE = 9.34, log loss
= 0.26), indicating superior predictive performance. Gradient boosting and multilayer perceptron (MLP) also exhibited competitive results with strong classification
scores and low error values. Conversely, Naïve Bayes and support vector machine (SVM) showed higher error metrics, reflecting less consistent predictive reliability.
These metrics provide a balanced view of both classification correctness and model confidence, aiding in robust model selection for student retention prediction tasks.

relying on subjective assessments and historical trends are often insuf-
ficient to capture the complexity of student attrition. To improve pre-
dictive capability and support timely interventions, ML techniques have
become  increasingly  prominent.  These  methods  enable  institutions  to
extract patterns from diverse data sources, generate accurate dropout
predictions, and inform data-driven policies aimed at improving student
outcomes.

In this study, multiple ML models were evaluated to predict student
dropout using a combination of academic and sociodemographic factors.
The  models were first  assessed using  a  traditional train-test split,  fol-
lowed by a more rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, to ensure robustness
and generalizability of results. Across both evaluation phases, Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperformed other models.
In the initial evaluation, XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 93.79 %, F1
Score  of  93.88,  and  the  lowest  MSE  of  6.21.  After  cross-validation,
XGBoost  maintained  its  top-ranking  performance,  achieving  an
average accuracy of 90.66 %, F1 Score of 90.72, and low error metrics
(MSE = 9.34, Log Loss = 0.26). The confusion matrix also reinforced
these findings, with XGBoost yielding 67 true positives, 69 true nega-
tives,  5  false  positives,  and  only  4  false  negatives—the  lowest  total
misclassifications among all models tested. Moreover, these results are
strongly supported by prior literature. Study [49] found that XGBoost
consistently outperformed alternative models in forecasting tasks such
as  stock  price  movements.  Similarly  [50],  emphasized  XGBoost’s  ca-
pacity for generalization, reduced overfitting, and enhanced predictive
accuracy  [51].  noted  that  XGBoost  is  uniquely  capable  of  handling
heterogeneous and noisy datasets, outperforming models that perform
best only under controlled or homogeneous input conditions. Further-
more  [52],  reported  that  XGBoost  achieves  superior  accuracy,  speci-
ficity, and sensitivity compared to Logistic Regression, particularly in
handling  class-imbalanced  datasets,  an  important  feature  in  dropout
prediction,  where  class  imbalance  is  often  present.  Together,  these
findings  and  our  results  strongly  establish  XGBoost  as  a  robust  and
adaptable model for educational prediction tasks.

Conversely,  Naïve  Bayes  was  consistently  the  weakest  performer

across all evaluation phases. It yielded the lowest accuracy (74.48 %) in
the initial evaluation and the highest error metrics after cross-validation
(MSE = 24.06, Log Loss = 8.67). Although Naïve Bayes recorded the
highest recall (97.21 %), it also produced 31 false positives, indicating a
tendency to over-predict dropout risk. While its simplicity and compu-
tational  efficiency  may  still  make  it  suitable  for  certain  contexts  or
ensemble integration, the high misclassification rates suggest it may not
be  ideal  for  high-stakes  educational  interventions  without  further
refinement.

The  analysis  also  highlighted  important  trade-offs  between  para-
metric  and  nonparametric  models.  For  example,  K-Nearest  Neighbors
(KNN), a nonparametric algorithm, achieved the highest recall (97.2 %)
but  also  had  one  of  the  highest  false  positive  counts  (29).  Likewise,
Decision  Tree,  another  nonparametric  method,  showed  strong  recall
(91.8  %)  but  relatively  poor  error  metrics,  reflecting  sensitivity  to
overfitting and variability across folds. These models are highly effective
in pattern detection but may require careful tuning and ensemble inte-
gration to enhance stability.

On the other hand, ensemble and hybrid models such as GB and ANN
offered  competitive, balanced  performance. GB achieved 89.42 %  ac-
curacy  post-cross-validation  with  a  low  Log  Loss  of  0.25,  the  lowest
among all models, and maintained strong classification results (66 true
positives,  68  true  negatives). ANN  followed  closely with  88.39  %  ac-
curacy, 86.35 % precision, and a high recall of 91.48 %. These models
demonstrate  high  sensitivity  and  specificity  while  maintaining  fewer
misclassifications,  supporting  their  reliability  for  real-world  applica-
tions. Also, the potential of neural network models is further supported
by [53], which found that deep learning architectures, including MLP
and ANN, outperform traditional statistical methods in modeling com-
plex  and  nonlinear  patterns  in  student  data.  However,  our  findings
suggest that while ANN performed competitively, XGBoost retained a
performance  edge  in  terms  of  both  classification  accuracy  and  error
minimization, suggesting greater generalizability and practical usabil-
ity, especially when false positives must be minimized in institutional
settings.

The integration of the predictive modeling framework developed in
this study demonstrates substantial pedagogical and institutional value
for ITE curricula in the Philippines. Although the analysis was conducted
using  data  from  a  single  institution,  Mindanao  State  University  Main
Campus in Marawi City, the design and structure of the dataset establish
a scalable and transferable foundation that can be readily adopted by
other higher education institutions. The dataset comprises 482 complete
student records and 146 variables, encompassing essential dimensions
of student profiling such as sociodemographic indicators (e.g., age, sex,
parental income), academic performance (e.g., normalized grades), and
program progression metrics (e.g., year level, total units earned, course
history).  These  data  dimensions  are  consistent  with  widely  accepted
frameworks in educational data mining and learning analytics [54,55],
making the model broadly applicable across academic settings.

Importantly,  this  framework  offers  a  replicable  blueprint  for  in-
stitutions aiming to develop their own student retention analytics. Prior
studies emphasize that predictive models based on institutional data can
effectively  identify  at-risk  students  and  guide  timely  interventions
[9–11,13–16]. Since the variables used in this study are generalizable
and align with common student information systems, other universities
can  easily  adapt  their  internal  data  infrastructures  to  adopt  similar
models. This creates a pathway for ITE programs to lead institutional
analytics initiatives, fostering real-world engagement with artificial in-
telligence  while strengthening  the  culture of  data-informed  decision--
making in education.

Moreover, this study underscores the strategic role of ITE programs
in driving institutional digital transformation. As digital transformation
in  education  increasingly  relies  on  data-driven  approaches  [53],
equipping students and faculty with the capability to build and interpret
predictive  models  using  academic  data  is  both  timely  and  necessary.
Engaging with real institutional data not only cultivates technical skills
but also develops ethical reasoning and accountability in the use of AI in
education—a point highlighted in literature on educational data science
[14,18,37]. By empowering students to apply these models within their
own institutions, ITE departments position themselves as active agents
of  change,  contributing  to  improved  educational  outcomes  through
interpretable, context-aware, and impactful computing solutions.

Looking forward, future research on student retention should prior-
itize the integration of psychosocial, behavioral, and engagement-based
features  [56]  such  as  attendance,  motivation,  learning  management
system (LMS) activity [57], and peer interaction data [58], to enhance
predictive power. Moreover, temporal modeling using architectures like
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks offers promising potential
for real-time risk monitoring and longitudinal trend analysis across se-
mesters [25]. To improve both model performance and interpretability,
researchers are also encouraged to explore Deep P-Spline Models [59],
Additive Gaussian Process Models [60], and hybrid ensemble strategies,
which  offer  scalable  and  flexible  frameworks  for  capturing  complex
non-linear patterns in large, structured educational datasets.

Furthermore, the results of this study affirm that XGBoost is the most
accurate,  stable,  and  generalizable  model  for  predicting  student
dropout,  outperforming  both  traditional  and  deep  learning  methods.
However,  the  continued  development  of  richer  datasets,  more  inter-
pretable models, and ethically aligned deployment practices will be vital
in  advancing  the  field  of  educational  data  mining  and  its  impact  on
student success, particularly when integrated into IT education for both
instructional and institutional innovation.

5. Conclusions

This study evaluated ten machine learning algorithms for predicting
student dropout using historical data from MSU-Marawi spanning 2012
to 2022. Through the application of the CRISP-DM methodology, com-
bined  with  Power  BI  for  preprocessing  and  Jupyter  Notebook  for
modeling, the data was rigorously prepared for analysis. After filtering
variables  using  Spearman  correlation  to  minimize  multicollinearity,

models were assessed using both a traditional train-test split and 5-fold
cross-validation. Among the tested models, XGBoost consistently deliv-
ered the highest performance in both classification and error metrics,
with an average cross-validated accuracy of 90.66 %, F1 Score of 90.72,
and low error values (MSE = 9.34, Log Loss = 0.26). Ensemble models
such  as  GB and  ANN  also showed  strong  and  balanced  results.  These
findings  demonstrate  that  predictive  modeling,  particularly  using
ensemble and neural network techniques, offers significant promise for
building  early  warning  systems  that  can  identify  students  at  risk  of
attrition. Moreover, the dataset and modeling approach are structured in
a  generalizable  format,  offering  a  transferable  framework  for  other
higher  education  institutions  aiming  to  improve  student  retention
through  analytics.  From  a  pedagogical  perspective,  the  integration  of
predictive modeling into ITE programs can cultivate technical compe-
tence in educational data science while reinforcing real-world applica-
tion of AI in institutional contexts.

Despite its promising outcomes, this study is not without limitations.
First, the data was sourced from a single institution, which may limit the
external validity of the findings despite the dataset’s broad and gener-
alized features. Further, while 5-fold cross-validation mitigated risks of
overfitting and sampling bias, more advanced validation strategies such
as  stratified  or  nested  cross-validation  could  yield  even  more  robust
generalization. In addition, the study focused primarily on academic and
sociodemographic  variables;  behavioral  and  psychosocial  dimensions,
such  as  LMS  engagement,  motivation,  or  peer  interaction,  were  not
included but are known to be significant predictors of student success.
The inclusion of these features in future studies may improve the pre-
cision and contextual relevance of predictive models. Similarly, while
XGBoost  achieved  the  strongest  performance,  model  interpretability
remains a challenge for deployment in sensitive domains like education.
Institutions seeking to implement such models should complement high-
performance  algorithms  with  explainable  AI  tools  to  ensure  trans-
parency,  fairness,  and  ethical  accountability.  Lastly,  this  study  re-
inforces  the  emerging  role  of  ITE  programs  in  driving  institutional
digital transformation by equipping both faculty and students with the
skills  to  develop  intelligent  systems  grounded  in  real-world  data.
Looking ahead, future research can build on this work by investigating
hybrid  ensemble  techniques,  Deep  P-Spline  architectures,  Additive
Gaussian  Process  Models,  and  longitudinal  approaches  such  as  LSTM
networks to capture more nuanced patterns in student dropout behavior.
As higher education institutions increasingly embrace data-driven de-
cision-making, this study serves as both a foundational benchmark and a
transferable framework for embedding predictive analytics into educa-
tional practice and strategic policy formulation.

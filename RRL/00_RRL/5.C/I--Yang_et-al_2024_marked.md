1.  INTRODUCTION

With the wide application of big data and artificial intelligence technology in all walks of
life,  we  have  witnessed  the  explosive  growth  of  data  and  the  flood  of  information.  In  the
financial field, customers' various transaction behaviors, product ownership information and
marketing  activity  participation  have  built  a  huge  database  of  information,  laying  the
foundation for digital applications.  [1]Compared with traditional measurement methods and
statistical models, machine learning has significant advantages in processing massive data and
discovering potential laws. Therefore, we choose supervised learning in machine learning as
the basis of artificial intelligence pricing  model, aiming  to  realize the combination of man-
machine decision-making, so as to achieve the purpose of accurately identifying customers and
effectively reaching the target.

The foundation of machine learning is built on structured databases. To this end, we first
dig  into  customer  information,  and  combined  with  business  experience  to  build  six
characteristic  system.  These  characteristics  mainly  include  customer  attributes,  debit  card
transactions, credit card installments, loan applications, trend characteristics, and visit behavior
to  product  pages.  [2]Among  these  characteristics,  debit  card  and  credit  card  transaction
characteristics  mainly  focus  on  the  transaction  frequency,  consumption  amount  and  credit

overdraft of customers in different time Windows; The trend features focus on the consumption
characteristics of individuals in the past month and the borrowing ratio. [3]Through the above
data processing and feature construction, our goal is to use artificial intelligence to achieve an
accurate portrait of customers, so as to stimulate the consumption potential of customers and
enhance the leverage of price management. This will provide financial institutions with more
effective  risk  management  and  loan  approval  decision  support,  and  promote  the  digital
transformation and innovative development of the financial services industry.

2.1 Financial Risk Monitoring Technology

2.  RELATED WORK

Financial risk, the risk generated in financial activities, refers to any potential threat that
may  lead  to  financial  losses  for  businesses  or  institutions.  [4-6]Financial  risk  can  be
categorized into several aspects, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational
risk, and legal risk. Market risk involves fluctuations in financial market prices, which may
arise from changes in interest rates, stock prices, and other factors. Credit risk refers to potential
losses  due  to  borrowers  or  counterparties  failing  to  fulfill  their  contractual  obligations.
Operational risk involves errors and losses caused by internal processes, systems, or human
factors. Liquidity risk refers to losses incurred when assets cannot be effectively bought or sold
within a specific period. Legal risk involves potential legal disputes and regulatory changes in
financial activities. [7]These risk components intertwine to form the complex and diverse risk
landscape in the financial system, requiring effective risk management measures from financial
institutions and regulatory authorities to mitigate potential adverse impacts.

Financial risk monitoring plays a crucial role in today’s economic system. It is not only a
key to maintaining financial system stability but also essential for protecting investor interests,
ensuring market confidence, enhancing market efficiency, and improving financial regulatory
frameworks. Effective risk monitoring techniques can alert potential financial risks, prevent
major economic impacts, optimize resource allocation for financial institutions, and enhance
overall market operational efficiency [8][9]. However, financial risk monitoring faces many
challenges, including handling large and complex financial data, adapting to rapidly changing
market environments, technological innovations, preventing financial fraud risks and security
threats, and addressing challenges posed by globalization and diversified risks.

Traditional financial risk monitoring techniques mainly include credit scoring, market risk
analysis, liquidity risk management, operational risk assessment, and compliance monitoring.
These techniques rely heavily on expert experience and traditional statistical models, but they
may  perform  poorly  in  fast-changing  market  environments  and  may  have  limitations  in
identifying complex business scenarios and new types of financial risks.

In  the  context  of  digital  transformation,  the  accelerated  pace  of  financial  technology
innovation  and  the  widespread  application  of  new  technologies  in  the  financial  field  have
introduced  new  dimensions  of  risk,  leading  to  new  characteristics  of  financial  risks.  [10-
11]Therefore, financial regulation and risk prevention face greater challenges, requiring urgent
research on the application of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in
financial  risk  monitoring  and  making  reasonable  predictions  and  arrangements  for  future
applications.

This paper suggests starting from the perspective of patent analysis. Patent layout plays a
critical role in modern business and technological development. It not only protects innovative
achievements  and  maintains  market  competition  but  also  generates  additional  income  for
companies through authorization and transfer, promoting product research and technological
progress.  Additionally,  patent  layout  helps  companies  effectively  manage  risks,  avoid
infringement,  protect  technological  advantages  when  expanding  international  markets,
enhance corporate image, increase brand value, and meet specific industry policy drivers and
compliance  requirements.  A  strong  patent  portfolio  is  an  indispensable  part  of  corporate
strategic planning.

2.2 Machine Learning and Bank Credit

Over the past two decades, automated underwriting and account management systems have
become commonplace in the retail credit industry. In traditional interview-based underwriting
systems, loan officers use subjective criteria to measure a customer’s creditworthiness. Instead,
banks automate this process with evaluation models that use data extracted from external credit
department data and internal account management data to predict the probability of a  “bad”
customer – see Thomas (2000)[12-13]. These models typically score customers to quantify the
probability that a customer is a  “bad customer,” which is defined by some metric related to
delinquency or default.

While the customer’s level of risk is an important factor for institutions to consider, lenders
are  primarily  interested  in  maximizing  profits.  As  we  all  know,  risk  and  profit  are  not
necessarily monotonously correlated. For example, a credit card revolving customer may have
a small possibility of default, but need to pay a lot of financial fees; If they pay off the balance
each cycle, no fees accumulate. The difference between risk models and the profit motive of
lenders has been noted in papers such as Finlay (2008), but models predicting account level
profits  are  still  relatively  rare  in  the  industry  due  to  data  limitations  and  the  potential
complexity of the models. However, with the advent of machine learning methods in credit risk
modeling [14][15], financial institutions have come to rely on models to estimate increasingly
complex relationships, leading to an increase in account-level profit models for a variety of use
cases.

A  range  of  literature  in  decision  science  and  operations  research  studies  such  models.
Finlay  (2008)  and  Finlay  (2010)  compare  linear  and  machine  learning-style  approaches  in
neural  network  algorithms,  demonstrating  that  a  continuous  financial  behavior  model  is
superior to a binary model of customer default. Fitzpatrick and Mues (2021) extend a set of
algorithms  for  predicting  profitability  in  the  context  of  P2P  lending  [16].  Verbraken  et  al.
(2014) point out that profit-based modeling allows the calculation of an optimal profit-based
threshold that would otherwise not fully approximate the average profit using default scores
and segment levels.

2.3 Risk control solution based on big data and machine learning technology
2.3.1. Face recognition technology
At present, face recognition technology has been applied in all aspects of life, such as facial
payment,  high-speed  rail  station  and  even  the  public  security  Skynet  system[17];  In  the
financial business, credit card processing, online loan applications are also widely used face

Tianyi Yang et al.

          56

recognition: compare the applicant’s photo with the ID card in the public security system to
judge  the  similarity  of  the  two  photos,  which  can  effectively  avoid  the  problem  of  non-
application.

Similar to human face recognition, when we humans are familiar with a person, we can
easily  judge  whether  the  person  is  this  person  based  on  his  facial  features  and  the  features
stored in our mind in the past (although there will be misjudgments), similarly, behind the face
recognition technology is also a set of deep learning algorithms. The process of our thinking
into a model algorithm, there are a number of commercial application companies that provide
face recognition services on the market, but the essence of the algorithm is basically the same,
the core idea of face recognition is that different faces are composed of different features.

Where do the vast array of features used to represent faces come from? This is where deep
learning (deep neural  networks) comes into play[18]. After learning and  training on tens of
millions  or  even  billions  of  level  face  databases,  it  will  automatically  summarize  the  face
features that are most suitable for computer understanding and differentiation.

Figure 1. Principle of machine learning face recognition technology
After elucidating that different faces are composed of different features, we have enough
knowledge  to  analyze  faces,  and  algorithm  engineers  usually  need  certain  visualization
methods to know what features the machine has learned to distinguish between different people
[19]:  the  features  extracted  from  different  photos  of  the  same  person  are  very  close  in  the
feature space, and different people are far apart in the feature space.

2.4 Identification of data forgery

Checking user information can be used to determine whether the borrower may be at risk
of  fraud,  using  the  relationship  graph  to  do  cross-checking,  although  not  guaranteed  100%
accuracy, but it is a powerful reference in the manual audit. The personal information that users
fill out is usually false. For example, the borrower Zhang SAN and the borrower [20]Li Si fill
in  the  same  company  phone  number,  but  the  company  Zhang  SAN  fills  in  is  completely
different  from  the  company  Li  Si  fills  in,  which  becomes  a  risk  point.  By  visualizing  the

57

    Journal of Knowledge Learning and Science Technology ISSN: 2959-6386 (Online), Volume 3, Issue 3, Sep 2024

relationship graph data, we can intuitively find the contradiction between the two, and we can
determine that at least one of them is at risk of fraud.

2.5 Analysis of gang fraud

In the credit scenario, the losses caused by gang fraud are more severe, but it is also difficult
to  detect  gangs in  the complex data. Based on the knowledge graph, we  usually intuitively
analyze data at multiple levels, including first degree association, second degree association,
third degree association, and even more dimensional association. Although the gangs use false
information for credit and use, they usually have common information, such as the same WIFI
and the same area. LOUVAIN, LPA, SLPA [21] and other community discovery algorithms
and label propagation algorithms can effectively and quickly find gangs.

3.  CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION MODEL IN TELECOM

INDUSTRY

This paper draws a sample of bank accounts from multiple datasets and analyses 150,000
loans originated in 2012, tracking them until December 2015. In order to preserve bank-level
anonymity  while  still  capturing  meaningful  product-  and  strategy-level  heterogeneity,  this
paper divides accounts into "integrated loan portfolios". For this purpose, the paper classifies
banks  as  a)  "high  liquidity"  banks  (Spender,  Spender),  b)  "high  finance  charge"  banks
(Revolver, Revolver), or c) neither (Middle, Middle) [22]. The paper then runs a multi-class
classification problem to predict whether an account belongs to a), b) or c). The critical value
of  the  score  determines  the  structure  of  the  overall  credit  portfolio.  Figure  1  shows  a
comparison of loan portfolios by typical credit sector attributes, and shows that spending banks
tend to consist of wealthier, higher credit quality, and more creditworthy borrowers than weekly
transition banks.

All the observed components of income and expenditure are added together to produce a
profit graph. Since net  credit losses increase monotonically with  risk, subtracting net  credit
losses from income will result in a significant reduction in the risk "sweet spot" in terms of
credit risk, as shown in the "actual value" in Figure 2. We can see that the hump shape of the
curve is most pronounced in the turnover portion, where the credit portfolios of spenders and
intermediaries are more closely related to risk.

This  suggests  that  it  is  more  important  for  institutions  with  such  credit  portfolios  to
understand risk-independent profits; At the same time, doing so is more challenging because
of its non-monotonic relationship with risk. Relatingly, across all portfolios, the profit quartile
spread across risk ranges increases with the level of risk, indicating the potential challenge of
capturing all changes in profits in high-risk areas.

3.2 Risk Model
After studying the relationship between risk and experiential profit, we can further study
the relationship between risk and predicted profit. This requires a shift from empirical profit to
predictive  profit,  which  in  turn  increases  noise  proportional  to  the  predictability  of  the
information set. Therefore, this paper establishes the profit model of related credit portfolio.

When modeling the behavioral subcomponents of profit, there are trade-offs in detail. One
can take a highly refined approach and build account-level models for a customer's monthly
balance, monthly repayment percentage, monthly tendency to pay late, and monthly tendency
to  write  off,  and  then  aggregate  these  models  across  time  at  the  account  level.  [23]Large
quantum models will increase the degree of freedom of aggregation models, enabling them to
better simulate relationships in NPV that are non-linear or have higher-order interactions. This
may also increase transparency, as one can find out which sub-models contribute the most to
customer  profit  calculations.  However,  a  large  number  of  submodels  can  also  increase  the
potential sources of model risk and multiply errors. In addition, if developers use more complex
modeling methods, such as machine learning methods, they will have the ability to fit highly
nonlinear  relationships  and  higher-order  interactions  that  may  occur  in  more  aggregated
modeling structures.

The actual model algorithm used for the estimation is[24] "Extreme Gradient Boosting",
also  known  as  XgBoost.  In  the  initial  model  exploration  phase,  this  paper  tested  the  driver
model structure at different levels of granularity and determined that the approach with the best
model  performance  was  at  a  relatively  aggregated  level.  Optimal  model  performance  is
achieved by modeling revenue, default probabilities, and default loss rates at the account level.
However, this method is relatively difficult to explain because it does not distinguish between
different sources of income. Due to this difficulty in interpretation, this paper chooses to model
the revenue drivers separately (but still at the account level), and the decline in out-of-sample
model performance is almost insignificant.

59

    Journal of Knowledge Learning and Science Technology ISSN: 2959-6386 (Online), Volume 3, Issue 3, Sep 2024

After the structure selection is complete, the next step is the complete model estimation
process.  For  each  submodel,  the  paper  uses  a  range  of  hyperparameter  search  and  variable
selection  techniques  to  improve  performance  and  interpretability,  and  reduce  potential
overfitting.  Firstly,  grid  search  is  carried  out  to  adjust  the  tree  depth  and  learning  rate
hyperparameters. Control the number of trees with 5x cross validation and early stop functions
for AUC. Because of the high risk of overfitting of this sample, the learning rate was limited
to a relatively small range (between 0.001 and 0.01); The number of trees is also high, reaching
into the thousands. This paper selects the best hyperparameters according to the out-of-sample
mean square error of the regression submodel and the out-of-sample classification error of the
default probability model, and then finds the first 30 variables of each submodel according to
XGBoost. After that, we re-estimate all submodels on these constrained feature Spaces through
another complete hyperparameter search. The results of these searches are shown in Table 1.

3.3 discussion

As  for  model  performance,  it  can  be  seen  from  the  previous  article  that  the  forecasting
performance of revenue model and total profit model is poor, but the ranking performance is
better. Without richer account performance data, it is difficult to accurately estimate the net
present value of customers to issuers. For example, the model has difficulty capturing changes
in experiential profits within the risk range and cannot capture increases in experiential profit
changes within the higher risk range. [25-27]This may have implications for the reliability of
profit  forecasts  in  the  higher  risk  range,  where  profit-based  modeling  provides  more
information than risk-based modeling.

However, the model still does a good job of separating more profitable customers from less
profitable customers, and the hump-shaped relationship between the profit component and risk
is  retained  between  the  predicted  curve  and  the  actual  curve.  This  shows  that  the  average
profitability of the portfolio obtained by ranking by this score is significantly higher than the
average profitability when the risk score is used alone.

4.  CONCLUSION

This paper describes the application of big data and artificial intelligence technology in the
financial  field  to  achieve  accurate  customer  identification  and  target  marketing  through
supervised learning models. Six feature systems, including customer attributes, debit and credit
card transactions, loan applications, trend characteristics and product page visit behavior, are
constructed,  and  artificial  intelligence  technology  is  used  for  data  processing  and  feature
construction, and finally to achieve an accurate portrait of customers[28-31]. This will not only

Tianyi Yang et al.

          60

stimulate  the  consumption  potential  of  customers,  but  also  increase  the  leverage  of  price
management,  provide  financial  institutions  with  more  effective  risk  management  and  loan
approval decision support, and promote the digital transformation and innovation development
of the financial services industry.

In  the  future,  with  the  continuous  advancement  of  technology  and  rapid  changes  in  the
financial environment, financial risk monitoring and customer behavior prediction will face
more challenges and opportunities. The further application of artificial intelligence and big data
technologies is expected to improve the accuracy and efficiency of risk forecasting, especially
in  dealing  with  complex  financial  risks  and  changing  market  environments.  In  addition,  by
improving  model  algorithms  and  data  processing  methods,  financial  institutions  can  better
maximize profits while reducing risks, further promoting the innovation and development of
fintech, and bringing new growth points to the industry.

Abstract  -  The  recent  improvement  of  machine  learning  and  data  integration  has  marked  new  heights  in  financial
analytics. A major area here that has become very popular is credit card customer profiling, which aims to identify
and classify  the  behavior,  preferences  and  risks of  the customer.  Traditional  methods  depend  largely  on  supervised
learning,  which  has  to  be  based  on  large  labeled  data  points.  Nonetheless,  since  the  emergence  of  Self-Supervised
Learning  (SSL),  it  is  possible  to  derive  meaningful  representations  by  selecting  unlabeled  and  heterogeneous  data
sources.  This  paper  presents  an  original  scheme  for  credit  card  customer  profiling  based  on  self-supervised
representation learning and financial data from multiple sources. The transaction records, customer demographics,
online banking activity and credit scores are brought together through a single analytical model. The method builds
into contrastive learning and transformer-based architectures to learn feature embeddings that are robust. We show
high-quality  profiling,  clustering,  and  downstream  tasks  like  creditworthiness  assessment  problems  and  churn
prediction on a real-world financial dataset that was collected prior to February 2025 and made up a significant bulk
of  our  experiments,  stating  that  our  framework  essentially  outperforms  baselines  in  terms  of  profiling  accuracy,
clustering  performance,  and  downstream  tasks  accurately.  We  elaborate  on  the  comparisons  of  performance  to
standard  models,  the  advantages  of  multiple-source  merging,  as  well  as  what  this  could  mean  to  the  individual
tailored  financial  services.  We  have  also  added  thorough  visualization,  flowcharts  and  ablation  studies  to
complement our findings.

  Definition  and  Core  Principles:  Self-Supervised
Learning  (SSL)  is  a  field  in  machine  learning  in
which  models  are  trained  to  learn  meaningful
representations  of  unlabeled  training  data  through
solving  auxiliary  or  alternate  (pretext)  tasks.  It
differs  from  supervised  learning,  which  requires
costly  and  sometimes  rarely  available  labeled  data
and instead uses unlabeled data best parts to assign
pseudo-labels  based  on  the  inherent  data  structure.
For  example,  Predicting  missing  values,  reordering
sequences,  or  finding  augmented  variants  of  the
same  input  are  tasks  that  can  guide  the  model  to
learn  meaningful  patterns  without  requiring  human
annotation.  Such  representations  can,  in  turn,  be
used  in  downstream  tasks  such  as  classification  or
clustering.

  Applicability to Financial Data: The popularity of
the SSL has increased in other spheres, but its use in
customer  profiling in  the  financial  service  sector  is
just coming of age. Financial data, which manifests
in  multiple  modalities  (including  tabular  records,
time  series,  and  behavioural  logs),  serves  as  a  rich
environment for applying SSL. SSL can be applied
to  learning  robust  representations  of  customers  by
devising  and  matching  suitable  pretext  tasks  (e.g.,
masked  transaction  prediction,  temporal  shuffling,
and behavioral similarity detection) and the required
spending  habits,  risk  indicators,  and  engagement
profiles  can  be  learned  in  an  entirely  unsupervised
way without relying on manual labels or search.
  Benefits  of  Using  It  in  Place  of  Conventional
Methods:  Compared  to  the  traditional  supervised
and  unsupervised  learning  techniques,  SSL  has  a
number of advantages. It alleviates the need to have
labeled  data,  and  the  financial  institutions  can
therefore use the humongous quantities of unlabeled

  Constraints  to  Data  Labeling:  The  need  to  use
labeled data is one of the most prominent obstacles
to  traditional  supervised  learning  when  applied  to
the
financial
information-  e.g.  detecting  high-risk  customers  or
detecting a fraudulent transaction is a job that needs
much  domain  knowledge,  as  well  as  access  to
sensitive information. Not only does this render the
process  time-consuming  and  costly,  but  it  also
raises  considerable  privacy  concerns,  given  that
regulatory  pressure  is  on  the  rise  to  adhere  to
standards such as GDPR and CCPA. The effect of it
is  that  much  potentially  useful  data  is  either  not
labeled  or  makes  use  of  only  a  few  labels,  so
conventional modeling approaches are limited.
Isolated  Data  Sources:  Customer  data  is  often
managed in multiple, disconnected systems at most
financial institutions. Data silos are inevitable, with
transactional  logs,  demographic  data,  credit  data
and  web  interactions  typically  stored  in  individual
databases  or
separate  business  units.  This
disintegration  interferes  with  the  formation  of  an
all-rounded  customer  profile  and  denies  models  a

2. Literature Survey
2.1. Traditional Customer Profiling Techniques

Conventional  techniques  of  customer  profiling  have
been  using  algorithms  like  K-Means  and  the  Gaussian
Mixture  Model  of  clustering.  [5-8]  These  techniques  are
generally  applied
in
to  hand-crafted
transaction  data and  demographic  data, i.e. age,  income  and
spending  patterns.  As  an  example,  the  K-Means  algorithm
divides  the  customers  into  specific  groups  based  on  the
similarity  of  their  features  but  takes  the  linear  separability
assumption,  which  restricts
the  representation  of  any
complex pattern in the high-dimension data.

features  mined

 The  Decision  Trees  were  quite  popular,  using
characteristics  such  as  credit  score  and the  mean  amount  of
transactions  to  classify  the  customer  profiles.  Nonetheless,
such  models  tend  to  overfit,  especially  when  over-fitted
small  or  noisy  data  is  used.  These  traditional  methods,
despite being simple and interpretable, cannot understand the
complexity  and  dynamism  of  contemporary  customer
behaviour very well.

2.2. Finance Finance Supervised Machine Learning

As  more  labeled  financial  data  becomes  available,
supervised machine learning models are starting to see wider
application  in  fraud  detection,  customer  segmentation,  and
credit  scores.  Random  Forests,  XGBoost,  and  Neural
Networks  algorithms  have  proven  to  have  great  predictive
abilities,  as  they  learn  complex,  non-linear  patterns  from
large  datasets.  These  models  enjoy  the  richness  of  features
and  may  accept  a  wide  range  of  input  classes,  and  yet  they
are  very  sensitive  to  the  availability  and  quality  of  labeled
data.  Moreover,  they  are  especially  prone  to  problems  such

166

Thulasiram Yachamaneni et al. / IJAIDSML, 6(1), 164-173, 2025

as  class  imbalance,  which  frequently  occurs  in  financial
realms,  e.g.,  a  few  fraudulent  transactions  make  up  a
negligible  proportion  of  the  data.  This  sensitivity  usually
demands  employing  data  augmentation  methods  or  loss
functions in the production of sturdy performance.

2.3. Development of self-supervised methods

Self-Supervised  Learning  (SSL)  has  become  a  strong
paradigm,  particularly  in  fields  where  costly  or  limited
labeled  data  is  available.  Methods  like  contrastive  learning-
Contrastive methods have proven to be hugely successful in
the  field  of  computer  vision  by  learning  representations  via
the comparison of augmented image pairs as seen via models
like SimCLR and MoCo. Transformer-based models, such as
BERT,  have  succeeded  in  transforming  natural  language
processing  by  allowing  for  deep  contextual  interpretation  of
unlabeled text.

These  advances  have  given  impetus  to  the  adoption  of
SSL  to  structured data,  such as  tabulated  data, although  this
is  a  growing  field.  Self-supervised  methods  have  started
becoming  used  in  the  field  of  finance;  one  example  where

Nevertheless,  they  are  not  extensively  used  to  profile
customers  on  a  wider  scale,  which  is  explained  partly  by
technological  difficulties  in  adapting  such  models  to  multi-
modal and multi-source financial data.

2.4. Gaps identified

Although there are some breakthroughs both in the field
of  machine learning  and deep  learning,  there is  still a  set  of
gaps that are  yet  to  be  filled  in  applying  such  techniques  to
customer  profiling in  finance. To  begin  with, little  seems  to
have  been  done  about  the  application  of  self-supervised
learning  to  heterogeneous  financial  data  that  consists  of
transactional,  demographic,  and  behavioral  data.  Second,
interpretability  remains  a  concern,  particularly  in  regulated
industries  where  transparency  is  imperative,  such  as  the
financial  sector.  Lastly, a  large part  of  existing models  does
not  fully  utilise  the  temporal  and  contextual  cues  present  in
customer  behaviour,  e.g.,  the  time  of  day  of  the  transaction
or scenario. Filling such gaps offers  the prospect of creating
stronger, interpretable and generalizable systems of customer
profiling.

  Multi-Modal  Feature  Encoding:  The  system  uses
separate  encoders  to  accommodate  its  modality  in
order to  manage  the  variety  of  data  sources.  As  an
example,  transactional  sequences  are  rolled  out  by
temporal  encoders  and  static  demographic  features
are  rolled  out  by  feedforward  layers.  The  encoders
learn  to  map  the  raw  inputs  to  a  common  latent

include  contrastive
learning, masked feature reconstruction, or temporal
order  prediction.  By  effectively  solving  such tasks,
the  model  encodes
interesting  patterns  and
structures  within  the  data,  which  improves  the
quality of the learned representations.

  Feature  Aggregation:  The  features  represented
across  modalities  are  then  pooled  into  a  single
unified  representation.  Information  is  integrated  in
terms  of  relevance  using  such
techniques  as
attention  mechanisms  or  weighted  averaging.  Such
a  step  is  required  to  explore  the  interdependence
between  different  types  of  data,  which,  in  turn,
results in a comprehensive picture of each customer
profile.

  Downstream  Task  Heads:  The  aggregated
representation  is  finally  fed  to  a  series  of  task-
specific  heads  with numerous  supervised  tasks  like
the  segmentation  of  customers,  risk  scoring  or
predicting  churn.  Heads  are  finetuned  by  labeled
data and make use of all of the rich representations
acquired  in  the  self-supervised  stage  to  achieve
higher performance on specialized business tasks

bases  for  assessing  creditworthiness  and  targeting

is  typically  presented  in  the  form  of  a  table  and  is
essential  in  determining  financial  risk.  It  is  usually
employed  in  terms  of  loan  approval,  credit  score
and fraud prevention.

  Web  Activity:  Data  on  web  activity  will  show  the

3.4. Self-Supervised Learning Design
3.4.1. Contrastive Learning Objective

The essence of contrastive learning is to teach the model
to  make
the  differentiation  between  comparable  and
dissimilar  pieces  of  data  without  necessitating  reliance  on
explicit images.  With  two  augmented  views  of  a  given  data
instance, the goal is to maximise the cosine similarity of the
representations  of  the  two  views  and  minimise  similarity
with representations of other instances in the batch.

3.4.2. Pretext Tasks

 The  logits  are  passed  through  a  temperature  parameter
before  the  softmax  function  is  applied,  and  this  adjusts  the
sharpness of the output distribution. This promotes the model
to learn discriminating and powerful features by drawing the
positive pairs nearer and exerting the negatives further apart

  Clustering  Layer:  On  top  of  the  learned  feature
representations, a clustering layer is applied in order
to  generate  interpretable  customer  profiles.  This
layer  segments  customers  with  similar  encoded
behaviours  and  attributes  and  makes  use  of
algorithms  like  K-Means  or  even  deep  clustering.
The resulting clusters are representative of different
groups of customers, and this can be used to market

services, or risk stratification.

  Masked  Attribute  Forecasting: In  this task,  some
of  the  attributes  or  features  in  the  input  data  are

bottlenecks. The configuration was also enabled to do large-
scale  hyperparameter  tuning,  as  well  as  ablation  studies  to
distinguish  the  effect  of  each  module.  On  the  whole,  the
experimental  environment  met  the  requirements  of  both
computational  and  real-world  feasibility  for  the  assessment
that  aimed  to  create  a  solid  benchmarking  scenario  for  the
proposed  self-supervised  learning  model  in  comparison  to
classical machine learning approaches.

4.2. Metrics

A  wide  range  of  evaluation  metrics  was  used  to  assess
the performance of the proposed system in a comprehensive
way  in  both  unsupervised  and  supervised  learning  tasks.  In
terms of clustering performance, two metrics commonly used
were  the  Silhouette  Score  and  the  Davies-Bouldin  Index.
Silhouette Score is a method that measures the unity among
clusters  and  the  dissimilarity  of  the  cluster  by  contrasting
intra-cluster mean distance and the mean distance to clusters'
neighbouring points. A Greater Silhouette Score implies that
data points are coupled to a cluster they belong at and do not
go  fairly  coupled  to  other  clusters,  denoting  distinct  and
isolated clusters.

 As opposed to that, the Davies-Bouldin Index measures
the average similarity of every cluster with its closest one by
taking  into  account  the  intra-cluster  compactness  as  well  as
the  inter-cluster  separation.  In  this  instance,  the  smaller  the
number, the better the clustering is, as it indicates a low level
of dispersion of each cluster and a large delineation between
clusters. A combination of these measures provides a reliable
in  segmenting
indication  of
the  model's  effectiveness
supervised
in
customer  profiles.  The  performance
classification  in  classification  problems,  specifically  credit
risk  prediction  and  churn  classification,  was  determined  in
terms  of  F1-Score,  AUC  (Area  Under
the  Receiver
Operating  Characteristic  Curve)  and  Accuracy.  F1-Score  is
also handy in case of imbalanced responses since it produces
a more  informative  statistic than  the accuracy  level  because
it balances between precision and recall.

 Precision  indicates  how  well  a  model  can  avoid  false
positive  results,  and  recall  is  used  to  measure  how  well  a
model  can  identify  the  true  positive  result,  which is  vital  in
the sense of risk in a high-stakes financial model. AUC is a
threshold-free  indicator  of  the  quality  of  ranking  of  the
model in terms of how effectively a model separates classes
at  every  possible  threshold.  Finally,  the  most  intuitive
measure  is  called  Accuracy,  defined  as  the  quotient  of  the
number of correctly predicted instances and the total number
of predictions. Although it is an easy measure to understand,
accuracy can be misguiding in distorted data, which is why it
is complemented with the rest of the metrics. This is a multi-
metric  assessment  that  allows  a  balanced  analysis  of
clustering and classification model qualities.

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Experimental Setup

The experimental setup aimed to assess the performance
of  the  proposed  self-supervised  learning  architecture  with
large-scale real-world data of a financial nature. The sample
consisted  of  100,000  records  of  customers  of  a  privately
owned  banking  company,  where  data  was  collected  until
February  2025.  It  was  multi-modal  data,  including  four
sources  of  information:  transactional  logs,  demographics
information, credit bureau records and traces of web activity.
Transactional  data  gave  a  timeline  of  customer  spending
behavior  in  terms  of  the  amount  spent,  the  time  of  the
transaction and the category.

income).
Information  in  credit  bureaus  provides  background  into  the
financial  faithfulness  of  every  client,  such  as  their  credit
ratings  and  credit  history  of  loan  repayment  and  liabilities.
Activity  in  web-based  logs  retrieved  behavioral  patterns,
namely  log-in  frequency,  click  trail  directions,  and  user
activity  with  online  banks.  In  order to  have  rigorous  testing
and avoid leaking of data, the given dataset was divided into
80% as training, 10% as validation and 10% as testing.

This  stratification  allowed  one  to  fine-tune  the  model
over the validation set and measure performance over the test
set in an unbiased manner. The experimentation and training
process  was  performed  in  a  high-performance  computing
environment  that  consists  of  two  NVIDIA  A100  GPUs,
capable  of  massively  parallel  computing,  and  512GB  of
RAM  to  support  training  with  large  batches  and  memory-
intensive  operations.  That  hardware  allowed  the  system  to
efficiently  train  complex  architectures,  like  transformer
encoders  and  multi-modal  feature  aggregators,  without  any

traditional
unsupervised  learning.  It  obtained  a  Silhouette
Score  of  0.35,  which  represents  fairly  weak  and
overlapping measures. Given that K-Means lacks in
terms of using temporal and contextual information,
the  algorithm  also  fails  to  develop  clear  customer
profiles.  Furthermore,  it  has  demonstrated  limited
predictive capabilities, with an AUC of 0.71 and an
F1-score  of  0.58  on  the  churn  prediction  task,  as
well as an F1-score of 0.36 on credit risk, due to its
simple and linear nature when its clusters were used
as feature inputs to downstream tasks.

  XGBoost: Being a supervised learning algorithm on
a  hyper-modern  level,  XGBoost  fared  much  better
than  K-Means  in  classification  assignments.  It
scored  an  AUC  of  0.84 and an  F1-score  of  0.69  in
credit
risk  assessment  and  churn  prediction,
respectively,  representing  its  strength  in  processing
tabular data and ability to fit non-linear interactions.
However,  its  Silhouette  Score  of  0.41,  calculated
based  on intermediary representations  generated  by
the last layer, hints at moderate improvements in the
quality  of  clustering  yet  projects  it  as  being
backwards in terms of producing global, behaviour-
sensitive representations that more powerful models
are capable of generating.

  Self-Supervised  Learning  (SSL):  The  SSL  model
presented  outperformed  all  baselines  on  every  one
of  the  metrics,  which  proves  the  worth  of  learning

through  multi-modal  signals  in  a  label-efficient
way. Silhouette's Score was 0.56, which means that
more  coherent  and  meaningful  customer  clusters
were formed. The model performed incredibly well,
with a very high AUC of 0.91 to predict credit risk
and  a  remarkable  F1-score  of  0.81  to  determine
churn. These findings make these results support the
skill  of  the  model  to  learn  a  rich  generalizing
representation  out  of  unlabeled  data  apriori  with
pretext  tasks  and  temporal  encoding  that  beat  both
clustering and supervised methods.

4.5. Ablation Study

To know the individual effect of the key elements of the
proposed  self-supervised  learning  (SSL)  framework,  an
ablation  study  was  carried  out.  The  study  can  provide
information  on  the  relative  significance  of  each  element  of
architecture  by  observing  the  effect  of  selective  removal  of
each  module  at  a  time  on  the  corresponding  decrease  in  its
credit  risk  prediction  performance  (measured  by  AUC).
Table 2 contains a summary of the findings, which have been
contained in detail below.

  Temporal  Encoding:  The  removal  of  temporal
encoding led to the greatest decline in performance,
whereby
the  AUC  slumped  by  4.2%.  This
emphasizes the importance of the modeling of time-
varying  dynamics  of  customer  behavior.  The
property of temporal encoding enables the model to
be  sensitive  to  out-of-sequence  and  out-of-trend
patterns,  i.e.,  a  history  of  sporadic  transactions,
delayed  payments,  or
in
expenditure, which are highly correlated with credit
risk.  In  its  absence,  the  model  can  no  longer
contextualise  behaviours  across  time,  also  resulting
in  more
transient  representations  and  reduced
predictive capability.

recent

  Web Activity: Web activity features were removed
and resulted in a 3.8% decrease in AUC; this meant
the features provided significant information on the
behavior  image  of  people  using  online  banking
portals.  The  implicit  clues  of  user  engagement,
financial  intents  and  reliance  on  digital  channels
occur with metrics such as logins, session duration,
and  sequence  of  clicks.  Although  these  signals  are
frequently  under-exploited,  they  bring  significant
value  to  the  table  when  they  are  combined  into  a
multi-modal  model.  When  they  are  removed,  this
impoverishes  the  input  behavior  and  limits  the
model view of user intent.

  Pretext  Task:  The  overall  removal  of  the  pretext
task module led to a 2.7 per cent decrease in AUC,
emphasizing  the  significance  of  self-supervised
goals  in  influencing  high-quality  representations  of
features.  Pretext  games,  such  as  masked  attribute
prediction  and  temporal  order  learning,  allow  for
the  discovery  of  latent  patterns  and  associations  in
the  data.  Whereas the  effect  is not as  significant as

5. Conclusion

This  paper  reviews  the  use  of  a  Self-Supervised
Learning  (SSL)  approach,  which  is  being  applied  to  profile
customers  within  the  financial  industry,  specifically  credit
card  users.  The  framework  suggested  was  based  on  using
multi-source  data,  including  transaction  logs,  demographic
information,  credit  bureau  reports,  and  web  activity,
compiled  to  create  comprehensive  representations  of  the
customers. With the help of contrastive learning and pretext
tasks, including  masked attribute  prediction and recognising
temporal  order, the  model  was  trained to  extract  underlying
patterns  and  dependencies  both  over  time  and  across
modalities without relying on labelled data. The outcomes of
the  experiment  showed  that  the  proposed  SSL-based  model
significantly  outperformed  classical  approaches,  such  as  K-
Means  and  XGBoost,  in  terms  of  clustering  quality,  credit
risk  prediction,  and  churn  classification.  It  is  noteworthy
that,  in  terms  of  Silhouette,  the  model  displayed  even  more
excellent  results  in  both  unsupervised  and  supervised  tasks
and performed well in F1 and AUC indicators. The ablation
study  also  supported  the  fact  that  the  effectiveness  of  the
model  owed  heavily  to  the  existence  of  parts  like  temporal
encoding, behavior characteristics based on web activity, and
self-supervised purposes

These  findings  have  tremendous  implications  for  the
financial industry. Due to the greater accuracy and resilience
of  customer  segmentation  and  risk  modeling,  financial
institutions  move  on  to  work  more  intensively  on  credit
scoring,

customer
management.  Besides,
the  detailed  representations  of
features  acquired  with  the  help  of  SSL  can  provide
personalized  product  suggestions,  adjustable  credit  limits,
and real-time intervention plans. To the customer, this means
more  customized  financial  products,  quicker  decision  times
and more personalized online experiences.

clients in a precise manner became a strategic capability. To
anticipate,  a  number  of  directions  can  contribute  to  the
strength of this research further. To begin with, the methods
of  federated  learning  would  enable  the  training  of  models
amid  remote  financial  institutions,  and  it  would  be  possible
to  train  models  on  a  large  scale  without  compromising  the
privacy  of  users  and  abiding  by
regulatory
requirements.  Second,  generalizability  might  be  enhanced,
and a bigger scope of financial behavior might be covered by
enlarging  the  model  to  a  cross-bank  consortium  dataset.
Lastly,  the  inclusion  of  reinforcement  learning  may  allow
personalization  techniques  to  be  adaptive,  such  that  offers,
alerts,  or  risk  scores  may  be  changed  on  the  fly  based  on
customer  reactions  or  actions.  All  combined,  these  future
improvements  will  continue  to  advance  intelligent  financial
services,  making  them  more  responsive,  secure,  and  user-
friendly.

ABSTRACT

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in consumer markets presents challenges, particularly in how cognitive biases
influence  financial  decision-making.  These biases  can lead to  irrational  spending, raising  ethical  concerns  about AI’s  role in  such
applications.  This  research  explores  how  AI  can  enhance  decision-making  effectiveness  and  support  consumers  in  making  more
rational financial choices. The focus is on developing an intelligent financial management system that applies modern AI algorithms
to  analyze  financial  behavior,  detect  anomalies,  and  offer  personalized  recommendations.  The  article  considers  a  system  for
generating personalized financial recommendations based on large language models, which uses transaction history, predicted costs,
and anomaly information to generate individual advice.  Techniques include using Isolation Forest for identifying atypical financial
actions and a combination of ARIMA and LSTM models for budget forecasting. The research also considers integrating these models
with  large  language  models  (LLMs)  to  generate  personalized recommendations.  The  methodological  part  of  the  work includes an
analysis of existing models and their areas of application, defining data types and structures for processing, developing a system that
integrates the available models, and testing it. The process of generating recommendations is described, which includes the stages of
processing input  data,  forming  context,  generating  recommendations  and evaluating  them  taking  into  account  user  characteristics,
such  as  risk  level,  financial  goals  and  preferences.  The  generated  recommendations  are  aimed  at  optimizing  the  user's  financi al
behavior and can be adapted to different income levels. Special attention is paid  to the ethical aspects of the system, which include
ensuring  confidentiality,  fairness  and  transparency,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  supporting  user  autonomy  in  making  financial
decisions.  The  system  promotes  responsible  financial  behavior  by  helping  to  avoid  impulsive  spending  and  increasing  financial
awareness without manipulation or imposing specific decisions.

INTRODUCTION

issues

The modern financial landscape faces numerous
challenges,  among  which  key
include
ineffective  financial  management  and  financial
illiteracy,  both  among  individual  consumers  and
organizations.  Many
lack  sufficient
knowledge
to  make  sound  financial  decisions,
making  them  vulnerable  to  aggressive  marketing
strategies.  This  is  especially  relevant  in  the  context
of increasingly sophisticated AI-enhanced marketing
techniques  that  can  manipulate  consumer  behavior,
promoting irrational expenditures.

Research  in  behavioral  economics  shows  that
cognitive  biases,  such  as  loss  aversion  or  framing
effects,  significantly  impact  consumer  decision-
making,  often  leading  to  deviations  from  rational
behavior.  This  highlights  the  need  for  intelligent

potential in the financial sector, particularly through
its  ability  to  analyze  large  volumes  of  data  and
uncover  hidden  patterns.  For  example,  systems  that
combine  cognitive  psychology  with  machine
learning algorithms can personalize user experiences
and  offer  recommendations  based  on  an  analysis  of
their  behavior  and  preferences.  This  enables AI  not
only  to  predict  consumer  behavior  but  also  to
provide  more  accurate
for
financial planning, budgeting, and investing.

In  [11],  it  was  noted  that  a  certain  limit  of
development has been reached for recommendations
systems  in  the  financial  sector.  At  the  same  time,
such  systems  are  “considered  to  be  intelligent  and

recommendations should also be evaluated based on
whether the provided recommendation was utilized.
Acceptance  of  AI-generated  recommendations
is a function of attitudes toward AI, trust, perceived
accuracy,  and  the  level  of  uncertainty  [18].  The
described

defines the basic psychological mechanism by which
users decide to accept AI-supported advice.

Consumers  often  prefer  human  interaction  in
fields  characterized  by  high  consumer  involvement,
such  as  healthcare  and  financial  services,  over
computer-generated advice [19]. However, AI is still
rapidly  being  implemented  in  the  financial  sector.

Privacy  and  security  are  important  issue  for
recommendation  systems.  Even  with  excellent
performance,  users  find  it  difficult  to  trust  such
systems due to opacity and privacy concerns [22].

In general, the ethical implications of using AI-
based recommendation systems are a distinct area of
research.  For  instance,  [23]  provides  a  conceptual
assessment  of  human  autonomy  when  using  a
universal  recommendation  system.  The  concept  of
human autonomy is defined in [24] as “the ability to
be  one’s  own person, to live  one’s life according to
reasons and motives that are taken as one’s own, and
not  the  product  of  manipulative  or  external  forces
that distort, thus being independent”. The conclusion
of  the  study  [22]  is  that  not  everything  needs  to  be
recommended,  and  people  should  be  aware  of  the
potential
impact  of  automated  recommendation
technologies.

Thus, when designing recommendation systems
to  support  financial  decision-making,  the  following
aspects must be considered; accuracy, completeness,
privacy, and adherence to ethical standards.

2. USING AI MODELS TO ADDRESS THE
ISSUE OF FINANCIAL RECOMMENDATION
FORMATION

In  the  financial  sector,  AI  is  also  used  for
detecting  anomalous  financial
transactions  and
preventing fraud. The Isolation Forest model, which

is well-suited for anomaly detection, can be applied
to  analyze  consumer  behavior,  particularly
to
identify spontaneous expenses or impulsive financial
decisions. Additionally, deep neural networks (CNN,
RNN)  are  actively  used  to  analyze  consumer  data
and  predict  behavioral  patterns,  enabling
the
optimization of marketing strategies.

AI  also  plays  an  important  role  in  financial
recommendation systems that help users choose the
best financial products or services. Algorithms based
on collaborative filtering and deep learning methods
are used to analyze user behavior and create targeted
offers  that  meet  their  needs.  These  systems  can
significantly

decisions by reducing the impact of cognitive biases
on consumer behavior.

The concept of Isolation Forest was used as the
basis for detecting anomalous user expenses, with its
core  idea  being  the  isolation  of  anomalies  from
normal data.

To  achieve  this  goal,  a  binary  tree  is  initially

created  by
distributing values. The next step is to determine the
anomaly  score  by  calculating  the  path  length  from
the root of the tree to the terminal node. The shortest
paths are considered anomalies.

2.2.  Budget  prediction  using  ARIMA  and

LSTM

Information Criterion (BIC), the model is trained on
the training data and used for short-term forecasting.

To predict user budget expenses, a combination
of two  models  was used: ARIMA (Auto Regressive
Integrated  Moving  Average)  and  LSTM  (Long
Short-Term  Memory).  Both  models  are  designed  to
work  with  time  series  data  but  have  different
approaches  to  solving  the  problem.  In  this  context,
ARIMA  was  used  for  short-term  forecasts,  and
LSTM  for  long-term  forecasts,  allowing  for  more
accurate  and  stable  predictions.  The  first  stage  of
prediction  is  data  preparation.  This  includes  data
cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing
the  data  format.  The  main  focus  is  on  removing
trends and seasonality from the data series, as these
factors can affect the accuracy of the forecast.

2.2.1. ARIMA model

The  ARIMA  model

consists  of

three

components:

•  AR  (AutoRegressive)  component,  which
models the dependency between an observation and
several previous observations.

•  I  (Integrated)  component,  used  to  eliminate

non-stationarity.

•  MA  (Moving  Average)  component,  which
models the dependency between an observation and
the forecast error.

Mathematically
described by the equation:

the  ARIMA(p,  d,  q)

is

𝑦𝑡 = 𝑐 + 𝜙1𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝜙2𝑦𝑡−2 + ⋯ + 𝜙𝑝𝑦𝑡−𝑝 +
𝜃1𝜖𝑡−1 + 𝜃2𝜖𝑡−2 + ⋯ + 𝜃𝑞𝜖𝑡−𝑞 + 𝜖𝑡,
where 𝑦𝑡 is the value  of the series at time 𝑡, 𝜙𝑖 are
the  coefficients  of  the  AR  component;  𝜃𝑗  are  the
coefficients of the MA component  𝜖𝑡 is the random
error term, c is a constant.

2.2.2. LSTM model

For  long-term  forecasts,  the  LSTM  model  is
used,  which  is  a  type  of  recurrent  neural  network
(RNN).  The  LSTM  model  can  capture  long-term
dependencies  in  time  series  data  due  to  its  specific
architecture,  which  includes  memory  cells  and
mechanisms
retaining
information.  Mathematically,  the  behavior  of  a
single  LSTM  block  is  described  by  the  following
equations:

𝑊𝑓 , 𝑊𝑖, 𝑊𝐶, 𝑊𝑜 are weight matrices; 𝑏𝑓, 𝑏𝑖, 𝑏𝐶, 𝑏𝑜
are bias vectors.

The  LSTM  network  is  trained  on  historical
spending  data  to  create  long-term  forecasts,  taking
long-term  dependencies  between
into  account
observations.

2.2.3. Combination of forecasts

The  final  step  is  the  combination  of  forecasts
obtained  from  the  ARIMA  and  LSTM  models.  For
this,  a  weighted  average  method  is  used,  where  the
results  of  both  models  are  combined  to  obtain  the
final expense forecast.

The formula for the final forecast is as follows:

^ = 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑦𝑡

𝐴𝑅𝐼𝑀𝐴^

𝑦𝑡

+ (1 − 𝛼) ⋅ 𝑦𝑡

𝐿𝑆𝑇𝑀 ^

,

where  𝛼    is  the  weight  coefficient  that  determines
the influence of each model on the final result.

The combination of ARIMA and LSTM allows
for  consideration  of  both  short-term  and  long-term
trends,  enhancing  the  accuracy  of  user  expense
forecasts.

An  AI-based  recommendation  system  can
promote responsible financial behavior by enhancing
the  user’s  financial  awareness  and  helping  them
avoid  potentially  irrational  expenditures.  In  an
aggressive  marketing  environment,  where  users  are
constantly  exposed  to  advertising,  an  ethically  built
recommendation  system  allows  users  to  maintain
control over their financial decisions. AI algorithms
analyze  data  to  ensure  the  accuracy  and  usefulness
of  recommendations,  avoiding  manipulation  and
supporting  user’s  long-term  financial  goals.  This

helps  users  navigate  a  complex
landscape  where  marketing  influences  often  lead  to
impulsive purchases and irrational spending.

CONCLUSIONS

The  use  of  AI  models  for  a  system  that
generates personalized financial recommendations is
described.  The  Isolation  Forest  model  is  applied  to
detect  anomalous  transactions,  using  a  tree-like
structure to isolate deviations in the user’s financial
behavior.  This  enables  the  model  to  effectively

identify  potentially  spontaneous  or  uncharacteristic
expenses.

In parallel, ARIMA and LSTM models are used
to forecast future  expenses. ARIMA provides short-
term  forecasts,  accounting  for  seasonal  fluctuations
and  dependencies in time series, while LSTM, with
its ability to capture long-term dependencies, is used
for more stable long-term forecasts.

The data generated by these models is fed into a
large  language  model  (LLM),  which  integrates
anomaly results, short-term, and long-term forecasts
to produce personalized financial recommendations.
These  recommendations  are  tailored  to  the  user’s
specific  financial  goals  and  behavior  and  can  help
optimize  the  budget,  reduce  risks,  or  increase
savings.

The  system  ensures  high  accuracy  through  the
combination  of  various  AI  models  (ARIMA  and
LSTM  for  forecasting,  Isolation  Forest  for anomaly
for  generating  advice),
detection,  and  LLM
completeness  by  training  on  user’s  transactions  and
financial  operations, as well as privacy and security
by adhering to OAuth 2 standards and OWASP Top
10 principles. The systems’ ethical aspect is reflected
in  its  support  for  users  in  managing  their  finances
rationally,  without  judgement  of  their  decisions.

АНОТАЦІЯ

Стрімке поширення штучного інтелекту (ШІ) на споживчих ринках створює серйозні виклики для суспільства, зокрема
в  контексті  використання  когнітивних  упереджень,  що  впливають  на  ухвалення  фінансових  рішень  споживачами.  Ці
упередження  можуть  призводити  до  нераціональних  витрат, що  ставить  під  сумнів  етичність  застосування  ШІ  у  подібних
сферах. У цьому дослідженні розглядається, як ШІ може не тільки підвищувати ефективність ухвалення фінансових рішень,
але й допомагати споживачам приймати більш обґрунтовані та раціональні рішення. Основна увага зосереджена на розробці
інтелектуальної  системи  управління  фінансами,  яка  застосовує  сучасні  алгоритми  ШІ  для  аналізу  фінансової  поведінки,
виявлення аномалій та надання персоналізованих рекомендацій.  У статті розглядається система генерації персоналізованих
фінансових рекомендацій на основі великих мовних моделей, яка використовує історію транзакцій, прогнозовані витрати та
інформацію про аномалії для створення індивідуальних порад. Зокрема, досліджуються моделі машинного навчання, такі як
Isolation  Forest  для  ідентифікації  атипових  фінансових  дій,  а  також  поєднання  ARIMA  та  LSTM  для  прогнозування
бюджетів.  Дослідження  також  розглядає  можливість  інтеграції  цих  моделей  із  використанням  великих  мовних  моделей
(LLM) для генерування персоналізованих рекомендацій. Методологічна частина роботи включає аналіз існуючих моделей і
сфер їхнього застосування, визначення типів та структури даних для обробки, розробку системи, що інтегрує наявні моделі,
та  її  тестування.  Описано  процес  формування  рекомендацій,  що  включає  етапи  обробки  вхідних  даних,  формування
контексту, генерації рекомендацій та їх оцінки з урахуванням характеристик користувача, таких як рівень ризику, фінансові
цілі та  уподобання.  Генеровані  рекомендації  спрямовані на  оптимізацію фінансової  поведінки  користувача  та можуть бути
адаптовані  до  різних  рівнів  доходів.  Окрему  увагу  приділено  етичним  аспектам  системи,  що  включають  забезпечення
конфіденційності,  справедливості  та  прозорості,  а  також  важливості  підтримки  автономії  користувача  у  прийнятті
фінансових  рішень.  Система  сприяє  розвитку  відповідальної  фінансової  поведінки,  допомагаючи  уникати  імпульсивних
витрат та підвищуючи фінансову обізнаність без маніпуляцій чи нав’язування конкретних рішень.

Ключові слова: штучний інтелект, машинне навчання, когнітивні упередження, фінансові рішення, етичність.

ABSTRACT

In  today’s  increasingly  competitive  streaming
landscape,  understanding  user  preferences in subscription
plan  selection  is  vital  for  implementing  data-driven
strategies.  This  study  examines
the  impact  of  key
demographic  and  behavioral  attributes—namely  age,
type,  and  subscription  start
gender,  country,  device
month—on  the  selection  of  Basic,  Standard,  or Premium
plans on a major streaming platform. Utilizing a dataset of
2,500 anonymized user records, a supervised classification
model  was  developed  and  validated  using  the  J48
decision-tree algorithm in WEKA. An 80/20 train-test split
was  applied,  and  the  model’s  performance  was  assessed
using  standard  evaluation  metrics,  including  accuracy,
Kappa  statistic,  precision,  recall,  F-measure,  and  ROC
area.

The model achieved an overall accuracy of 72%,
with  country  identified  as  the  most  influential  predictor,
followed  by  age  and  device  type.  Results  revealed

With  the  growing  amount of data available from

of  these  models  can  lead  to  enhanced  service  offerings

Hsiao (2023) highlights that an accuracy of at least 70% is

Decision‑Tree Applications in Streaming Analytics

Decision

trees  have  seen  wide  adoption  in
streaming analytics because they produce human‑readable
rules.  Gomez‑Uribe & Hunt (2015) originally applied tree
models  to  viewer  engagement,  showing  how  splitting  on
country,  device  type,  and  user  tenure  yields  coherent
segments.  In  the  context,  J48’s  ability  to  partition  on
month  of  subscription start further captures seasonality in
plan uptake. Contrary to the notion that deep trees always
overfit,  recent  work  shows  very  large  trees  can  still
generalize  well  with  proper  validation.  For  instance,
Aouad et al. (2023) report final decision trees with depths
52–78 containing 800–4100 leaves; despite their size these
models  achieved  superior
test-set  performance  (e.g.
significant  improvements  in  AUC  and lower MSE) when
properly  cross-validated.  In  other  words,  trees  with
hundreds of leaves can retain strong predictive accuracy if
pruned  or  validated,  this  substantiates  that  “trees  with
300+  leaves  can  still  generalize  well  when  properly
validated. In practice, an 80/20 train-test split is commonly
employed  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  decision  tree
models. This approach ensures that the model is trained on
a substantial portion of the data while reserving a separate
subset  for  unbiased  testing,  thereby  providing  a  reliable
assessment of the model's generalization capabilities. Such
validation  strategies  are  crucial  for  developing  robust
models that perform well on unseen data (Awad & Fraihat,
2023). Emerging research also explores the adaptability of
decision  trees in streaming data contexts. Manapragada et
al.  (2020)  discuss  the  use  of  Hoeffding  trees  in evolving
data  streams,  highlighting  their  efficiency  in  real-time
applications. Haug et al. (2022) introduce Dynamic Model
Trees  for  interpretable  data  stream  learning, emphasizing
their ability to maintain flexible and robust representations
in active data concepts.

the
target  subscription  plan.  During  preprocessing,
duplicate entries and any records with missing values were
removed to preserve data integrity and avoid bias in model
training  (Nasima,  2025).  Categorical  fields  like  country,
gender,  and  device  type  were  encoded  as  nominal
attributes,  while
the  subscription  start  month  was
formatted as an integer (1–12). Continuous variables such
as age were retained to allow the decision‑tree algorithm to
determine  data‑driven  split  points,  enhancing the model’s
ability to capture nonlinear patterns in the data.

Model Training and Validation

The  cleaned  dataset  was  subjected  to  the  J48
decision‑tree  algorithm  to  construct  a  hierarchical  set  of
decision  rules  that  map  user  attributes  to  subscription
outcomes (Razzaq, 2017). To guard against overfitting and

an  80 %  by  20 %  percentage  split,  training  the  model on

The  decision  tree  reveals  that  subscription  plan
selection  is  strongly  influenced  by  a  combination  of
country, age, device, gender, and start month. In the United
States,
the  model  shows  a  nuanced  segmentation:
Smartphone  users  aged  31  and  below  tend  to  choose the
Basic plan if they subscribe early in the year (start_month
≤  5),  but  shift  toward  Premium  when  subscribing  later
(start_month  >  5).  The  preferences  of  Smart  TV  users
further  segment  by  gender and age. Females aged 40 and
below  alternate  between  Basic  and  Premium,  depending
on  exact  age  and  start  month, while males aged 33 to 44
often  align  with  the  Standard  plan,  particularly  in  the
mid-year period. These findings illustrate that subscription
behavior  in  the  U.S.  varies  with  time,  age,  and  access
device,  allowing  precise  targeting  strategies  that  match
subscription plan with user lifecycle stages.

In  Canada,  the decision rules highlight that male
Smartphone  users  who start their subscription before July

using  Smart  TVs  or  Laptops,  especially  mid-year.  This
indicates dual targeting strategies based on age and device
sophistication. In Mexico, the primary determinant is age;

found  along  the  diagonal  of  the  matrix,  where the actual
and  predicted  classes  match.  The  model  correctly
identified  123  Basic,  119  Standard,  and  118  Premium
users.  Incorrect  predictions  appear  in  the  other  cells  and
are  fairly  evenly  spread,  indicating  that  the  model
performed  consistently  across  the  different  subscription
plans.  The  confusion  matrix  further  reinforces  these
findings,  highlighting  the  model’s  balanced  and  reliable
classification  performance  across  all  three  subscription
plans.

CONCLUSION

This study successfully developed and validated a
predictive  decision-tree  model  using  the J48 algorithm in
Weka  to  classify  users  into  Basic,  Premium,  or  Standard
subscription  plans  based  on  key  demographic  and
behavioral  attributes.  The  model  achieved  an  overall
accuracy of 72%, with a weighted F-measure of 0.721 and
ROC area of 0.834, demonstrating strong predictive power
and generalizability across unseen data.

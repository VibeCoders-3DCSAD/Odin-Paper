Poverty is as old as human civilization, hard to eradicate, multidimensional, and difﬁcult to measure. The methods
used to measure poverty today are costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, policymakers ﬁnd it difﬁ-
cult to target policies when putting poverty reduction initiatives into action. Indigenous communities are among the
most disadvantaged and vulnerable populations in society. Their socioeconomic situations are complex and multifac-
eted. While research on poverty is usually generic, prone to large sampling errors, and intended to guide national pol-
icy, research on indigenous people is qualitative. Thus, to measure multidimensional poverty with disaggregated
techniques, this work blends machine learning and econometrics. Researchers who have been studying poverty world-
wide can replicate all of the approaches, strategies, and resources used in this study. With the best R-square and accu-
racy, random forest models perform better than all regressors and classiﬁers combined. It also conﬁrms the causal
relationship and current econometric association between multidimensional characteristics and poverty conse-
quences. This study demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to predict poverty in a way that can save
costs, cut labor, and maximize time to empower indigenous communities and alleviate the poverty of impoverished
societies in the poorest region of Luzon, Philippines.

Abucayan is the most impoverished locality. San Jose, San Benito, and
Panday have the fewest impoverished households. While poverty is wide-
spread in the Isarog Sector, it is not as severe in the Poblacion community.
Watt's Index claims that Isarog communities have a greater prevalence of
poverty. Poor households and people are reﬂected through poverty inci-
dence, which represents the headcount ratio of those living below the pov-
erty line and food thresholds in the Philippines, relative to the total number
of households and population [1,2,11,18,21].

Fig. 2. Results of multidimensional poverty evaluation at disaggregation and combination through the multiple constructs and indicators.

About 63.70% of people live in poverty and 51.10% of individuals do
not have access to food. The dynamics of education, income, and health
all clearly demonstrate poverty. In the Philippines, households with a
monthly income of PhP10,481 (about 186.18 USD) and below for a family
of ﬁve are considered poor. It is important to consider that different regions
may have different poverty lines, so it is pre-requisite to identify the poverty
line in your area before applying our suggested ML models. Multidimen-
sional Poverty deprivation refers to the 15 economic variables that we
have employed, which serve as predictors or independent variables in our
econometric and machine learning models. It offers a more comprehensive
approach. Instead of using an index, we employ binary and dummy data to
capture non-linear relationships [1,2,21,23].

As a factor impacting health dynamics, the results indicate that house-
hold size is a strong predictor of poverty. Poverty is more likely to be expe-
rienced by informal settlers than by formal settlers. Furthermore, the
chance of falling into poverty increases with the number of household
members [1,2,6,20,24].

With an RMSE of 0.3298, the random forest method performs better
than the others, LightGBM at 0.3642 and XGBoost at 0.4001. These results
are derived from ML models (regressors) displayed on video slides 15 and
17. The reason why random forest performed the best is that it can identify
explanatory factors, ﬁnd nonlinear correlations between explanatory and
dependent variables, and estimate feature importance, which provides in-
sight into the features that have the greatest inﬂuence on the categorization
process. Although the outcome of machine learning (ML) is dependent on
the context of the data, results from ML applied to similar datasets and
models in other locations would be comparable. Maybe the only things
that would change are the predictors. The ML model is sustainable in this
way since it requires a large amount of data, and the data we utilized is
available in the Philippines every two years after the census. Furthermore,
even with cross-sectional data, different regions can apply machine
learning once the data is accessible for them, because a medium-term social
outcome can be predicted by an ML model [1,2,19,10,15].

For the entire municipality, the random forest regression algorithm has
the lowest mean square error, at 0.0792. XGBoost (0.4722) and LightGBM
(0.1242) are in its wake. The ML models we used are speciﬁc to the areas
we studied. Therefore, we initially employed econometrics to identify
proper predictors for ML models that are speciﬁc to our local context. How-
ever, the poverty models (logistic) and the ML models (regressors and clas-
siﬁers) are generic and can be applied to other regions or countries.
Consequently, repeatability is highly feasible in this regard. Other regions
of the world would need to identify their own predictors, but the models
we used could also work for them [1,2,15,22].

Fig. 6. Average R-square of machine learning regressors for impoverished societies.

With an R-square of 0.4221, the linear regression has the lowest value.
The random forest regressor produced the highest R-square, 0.92075. It
suggests that the regression that best matches the regression line and has
the lowest error score is the random forest regression. Since the data exam-
ined in this paper is based on a comprehensive census of all populations in-
cluding indigenous people, there are no known limits. As a result, it remains
exempt to sampling error and upholds the sample assumptions of internal
and external validity. The writers thoroughly examine and ﬁlter the data's
multidimensional variables. The dataset is well-sized and devoid of well-
known biases. But time is of the essence. It takes time to create trustworthy
and veriﬁable datasets and models [1,2,12,13,14].

Fig. 7. Performance evaluation of machine learning regressors for impoverished societies.

With an accuracy of 0.9108, the random forest regression classiﬁer has
the highest performance. The algorithms with the lowest accuracy are Bag-
ging (0.8437) and Decision Tree (0.8418). The R-squares for the SVM,
AdaBoost, Gaussian NB, and Perceptron are 0.86–0.87. The random forest
classiﬁcation has the greatest accuracy rate of 95.94% in pipeline algo-
rithms. Concerning the future improvements, the utilization of econometric
models and predictive analytics datasets has the potential to generate em-
pirical data that strengthens poverty theories that apply to entire popula-
tions, including indigenous populations. This would contribute to the
existing body of knowledge about the dearth of multidimensional poverty
metrics in developing nations like the Philippines, especially for indigenous
populations. Applying the models to all other tribes in the nation and utiliz-
ing artiﬁcial neural networks could both enhance forecast accuracy and
yield improvements [1,2,8,16,17].

Indigenous people make up about 11.84% of all households in Goa,
Camarines Sur. San Pedro Aroro, Payatan, and Balaynan are the most pop-
ulous indigenous tribes, with respective total population distributions of
92.50%, 68.66%, and 46.30% [3,4,7,11].

Fig. 9. Multidimensional socioeconomic evaluation and poverty examination of indigenous people tribes.

There are 1660 houses of indigenous people and 8022 persons in total.
Eighty-two percent of people live in poverty, and 71% do not have access to
food. Evaluation results for schooling are largely constant throughout
barangays, suggesting that most children in the neighborhood are not en-
rolled in school or have stopped enrolling as educational levels rise
[3,4,7,11,18].

Fig. 11. IP Classiﬁcation Prediction Margins.

Living below the poverty level is more common among IP informal set-
tlers. Moreover, the probability of poverty increases with the number of
household members. The results of the Estat categorization are positive.
Overall, 86.14% of cases were appropriately classiﬁed [3,4,5,9,25].

Fig. 12. Average mean square error (MSE) of machine learning regressors in IP modeling.

After LightGBM and XGBoost, the random forest regression method has
the lowest mean square error (0.5497). Causality tests using econometrics
(logit and probit regression) were initially performed to identify predictors
for the ML models. All the multidimensional indicators used in the model
(Fig. 9) and reﬂected in the video have a causal relationship with poverty
for IP groups. The following variables have been found to have causality:
Health and Nutrition, Housing, Water and Sanitation, Basic Education, In-
come and Livelihood, and Peace and Order. Since these variables are caus-
ally linked to poverty, they serve as predictors in the ML models. Given that
these variables have a causal relationship and are predictors of poverty in
the models, our policy mapping and targeting analysis focuses on these var-
iables. We concentrate on addressing these variables in order to improve
policies, as doing so would alleviate poverty and promote development
[3,4,15,22].

Fig. 13. Average R-square of machine learning regressors for Indigenous Communities.

Of all the techniques, linear regression has the lowest R-square, at
0.4222. Next are a polynomial algorithm and an SVR. With an R-square
of 0.9208, the random forest regressor produced the highest results, al-
though CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM all performed similarly. It im-
plies that the random forest regression is the one that most closely
resembles the regression line and has the lowest error score [3,4,12,13,14].

Fig. 14. Performance evaluation of ML classiﬁers at random and pipeline for IP.

For all tribes at random (α), the random forest regression classiﬁer has
the highest accuracy (90.69%); K-Nearest Neighbour, Gradient Boost, and
Logistic follow. At pipeline (Ω), the random forest classiﬁcation has the
greatest accuracy rate at 94.89%. The next two classiﬁcation strategies are
gradient boost and logistic. The results afﬁrm that all 15 indicators serve
as predictors of poverty, and the random forest algorithm emerges as the
most effective model for poverty prediction. Therefore, it is crucial to ad-
dress all these indicators adequately since they are the root causes of poverty.
By formulating policies that target each predictor, poverty can be alleviated,
leading to advancements in economic development [3,4,8,16,17].

Sofija KRSTEV, Jovana FORCAN, Dragoljub KRNETA*

Abstract: Mid-term electricity consumption forecasting is analysed in this paper. Forecasting of electricity consumption is regression problem that can be defined as using
previous consumption of an individual or a group with the goal of calculation of future consumption using some mathematical or statistical approach. The purpose of this
prediction is multi beneficial to the stakeholders in the energy community, since this information can affect production, sales and supply. The Different methods are considered
with the main goal to determine the best forecasting model. Considered methods include Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average models, state-space models
and exponential smoothing, and machine learning methods including neural networks. An additional objective of the conducted research was to determine if modern methods
like machine learning are equally precise in forecasting mid-term electricity consumption when compared to traditional time series methods. The performances of forecasting
models are evaluated on the monthly electricity consumption data obtained using real billing software owned by the Distribution System Operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mean absolute percentage error is selected as a measure of prediction accuracy of forecasting methods. Every forecasting method is implemented and tested using the R
language, while data is collected from Data Warehouse in the form of total monthly consumption. The efficiency of presented solution will also be discussed after presentation
of the results.

INTRODUCTION

The  economic  development  of  a  country  depends on
the availability of cheap and sustainable energy, especially
since  most  of  the  industry  depends  entirely  on  its  use.
Electricity  consumption  forecasting  plays  a  key  role  in
ensuring a reliable supply of electricity to the system and
reducing operational costs. In energy company operations,
decisions  are  also  made  in  line  with  electric  load
forecasting. It can be very helpful and economic to predict
as  accurately  as  possible  in  order  to  better  plan  power
production  in  power  plants,  to  plan  energy  market
transactions to negotiate better energy prices, and to plan
fuel and raw materials procurement. Energy consumption
is also used in maintenance planning [1]. The accuracy of
in
is  of  even  greater
load  forecasting
deregulated electricity markets due to the financial risks of
market  participants.  The  fluctuating  electricity  and  fuel
prices,  combined  with  the  uncertainties  of  customer
demand  and  solar,  wind,  or  hydro-power  generation
impose significant risks for utility companies [2].

importance

According  to  various  publications,  load  forecasting
can be broadly divided into three categories relative to their
time  horizon:  short-term  forecast  (STLF)  which  covers
forecasting in time horizon from one hour up to two weeks,
mid-term forecast (MTLF) which covers forecasting from
time horizon from two weeks to two years, and long-term
forecasts  (LTLF)  which  cover  forecasting  for  a  period
longer than two years [2, 3].

All three types of forecasting are important for electric
utilities  because  of  the  different  usages  of  all  three
forecasting  categories  in  servitude  for  different  company
goals  and  divisions  [1].  Energy  companies  use  STLF  to
support decision-making with data in order to better plan,
produce, keep reserves, and operate but also to bring higher
security  and  financial  stability  to  daily  operations  [4].
STLF has become increasingly important in daily market
operations  [5]  mostly  because  of  the  increase  and
strengthening of the competition in the energy markets [6].
MTLF  is often  used  in  power plant production  planning,
and  it  is  of  great  importance  for  grid  upkeep  planning.
MTLF  is  very  important  for  countries  whose  power

information

systems operate in a deregulated environment since it gives
the  decision  makers
about  market
consumption  behaviour  which  would  lead  to  better
procurement  planning  and  negotiating  precedence.
Additionally, MTLF is essential for individual customers
who  operate
structured  procurement  or  portfolio
management in deregulated markets [2]. LTLF is the basis
for  energy  investment  planning  and  plays  a  vital  role  in
developing countries [7].

During  the  last  50  years,  a  great  number  of  load
forecasting  methods  have  been  developed.  Forecasting
methods  are  often  divided  into  two  groups:  statistical
approaches  and  artificial  intelligence-based  (AI-based)
techniques  [8].  The  first  group  consists  of  naïve
approaches, exponential smoothing - ETS, linear or logistic
regression,  methods  based  on  time  series,  etc.  The  AI-
based  group  includes  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)
models,  support  vector  machines  -  Linear  and  Radial,
Elastic  nets,  tree-based  methods,  similarity  methods,
boosting, bagging, etc. In some cases, hybrid methods are
developed  by  combining  several  methods  [9,10].  These
hybrid  approaches  often
in
modelling. Many of above mentioned are mostly applied to
STLF  problems  [9-16].  For  example,  in  [9]  a  hybrid
approach  based  on  the  wavelet  transform  and  support
vector machine is used to solve the STLF problem. In [10]
the  fuzzy  linear  regression  method  is  used  for  load
forecasting
and  Monday
consumption,  while  the  general  exponential  smoothing
method  was  used  for  weekday  consumption  forecasting.
AI-based  forecasting  methods,  Neural  networks  [11-13],
fuzzy  logic  [14,  15],  and  genetic  algorithm  [16],  show
promising results for STLF.

logic

Often considered to be a special category, the Kalman
filtering technologies have thus far proved to be the most
complex,  yet  reliable  methods  in  time  series  forecasting
[17]. Several applications can be found in [18, 19].

Compared

to  STLF,  mid-term  and

long-term
forecasting  are  rarely  seen  in  research  publications  [20].
According  to  [21],  accurate  mid-term  forecasting  is  the
bigger challenge, because consumption habits are not the
only factor  affecting  the pattern, but also random  factors

such  as  the  country's  political  or  economic  decision-
making and governance. It is stated in [20] that MTLF and
LTLF are highly complex challenges that require not only
fitting multiple models and tweaking the parameters of it
but  more  about  learning  about  data  and  focusing  on
analysis  and  data-centric  thinking.  It  depends  highly  on
domain  experience  in  the  utility  sector,  primarily  energy
companies, i.e., how electricity companies work, how they
depend  on  technology  breakthroughs,  or  even  different
economic or political factors or global events [20].

Also,  MTLF  data  contains  a  lot  of  noise  since  those
data contain information that is better seen in STLF data.
For example, in the area of energy consumption, move-in,
move  out  and
temporary  abandonment  cannot  be
recognized as events, which can be clearly recognized in
STLF  data.  On  the  other  hand,  LTLF  data  contains  less
information  and  can  be  generalized  or  can  ignore  those
kinds of events in forecasting.

As seen by the authors, research gap is seen through a
smaller  number  of  papers  exploring  possibilities  in
application  of  different  models  and  methods  in  MTLF
prediction. Moreover, dataset used in training the model is
the first of this kind in Bosnia and Hercegovina and can be
the  energy  community  and  regional
insightful  for
academia.

1.1  MTLF Overview

for  mid-term

MTLF  plays  a  great  role  in  decision-making  for
countries  whose  power  systems  operate  in  a  deregulated
environment.  The  special  significance  of  MTLF  is
reflected in its contribution to system reliability, as it can
be  used  to  optimize  maintenance  schedules.      Also,  an
accurate  MTLF  is  necessary  for  an  economically  viable
system.  Techniques  developed
load
forecasting  that  use  statistical  methods  are  considered  in
[22-25].  In [22],  authors  fit  a  SARIMA  model  to predict
electricity  consumption  in  Saudi  Arabia.  The  SARIMA
model is shown to outperform the regression and abductive
network machine-learning models developed earlier on the
same data. In [23], a parametric regression method based
on STLF correlation is proposed for MTLF/LTLF. In [24],
an
autoregressive  model  utilizing  meteorological
parameters  is  proposed  to  estimate  monthly  demand
predictions for a period of 1-year and applied as a pilot in
Greek  power  utility.  The  model  provides  high  accuracy
forecasts. A semi-parametric additive model is proposed in
[25] to forecast a huge number of electricity consumption
series on the distribution grid in France at both the daily
horizon  and  yearly  horizon.  The  yearly  prediction  was
based  on  monthly  peaks  calculated  from  daily  peaks  in
network  load.  The  model  showed  good  and  sufficient
performances  for  the  industrial  perspectives.  In  [26],  the
authors suggested a combination of Bootstrap aggregating
for  monthly
time  series  methods
(Bagging)  and
consumption prediction in different parts of the world. The
proposed  methodology  showed  great  performance  in
different parts of the world.

AI-based  approaches  are  often  used  in  mid-term
forecasting. In [27] authors used neural network models to
predict monthly load using historical temperature data for
the  Israel  power  grid.  Their  proposed  ANN  model  gave
better  predictions  compared  with  statistical  approach

methods.  In  [28],  the  authors  implemented  a  statistical
approach  (ARIMA)  and  an  AI-based  (a  simple  neural
network  and  fuzzy  neural  network)  and  compared  the
performance. The conclusion was in favour of the AI-based
approach. In [29] authors proposed dynamic ANN, called
DAN2,  which  is  based  upon  the  principle  of  adaptive
learning for each network layer, propagating knowledge in
lower layers, resulting in targeted network performance in
the  last  layer.  Forecasted  results  in  such  dynamic  neural
networks  showed  good  performance  which,  when
measured by MAPE values to be comparable, showed to
be more accurate compared to traditional statistical, time
series, or standard neural network models.

An  overview  of  SVM  in  terms  of  estimations  of
function curve was described in [30] while load prediction
using the same method was discussed in [31-35]. Various
mid-term forecasting methods are developed and tested on
different  data  sets.  Some  research  recommends  using
proposed  statistical  methods  while  some  show  that  AI-
based methods are superior to statistical techniques.

According  to  [36],  AI-based  approaches  are  still  not
the  first  choice  when  predicting  univariate  time  series.
There  is  a  lower  number  of  publications  using  machine
learning (ML) approaches than classical statistical ones. In
[37] authors showed that classical statistical methods give
better  performance  in  terms  of  accuracy  than  machine
learning  methods  for  univariate  time  series  and  they
pointed out that the reasons are still unknown and need to
be defined to improve the performance of already proven
powerful AI approaches [37]. In the analysis, the authors
used  1045  monthly  time  series  data  from  the  M3
Competition. Motivated by [37], in [36], the authors did a
data-centric  analysis  of  the  sample  size  influence  on  the
final performance of a method. They showed that a small
sample size suits better statistical approaches, while the big
data analysis is stronger in AI-based approaches [36].

In  the  last  three  years  (2018-2022),  focus  of  the
academia  stayed  the  same,  Neural  networks  and  fuzzy
approach  dominate  published  papers  in  the  AI-based
methods,  while  exponential
smoothing  dominates
statistical methods. Moreover, published works now tend
to  combine  several  methods  or  approaches  to  get  better
performance or accuracy. In [38], long-term prediction is
presented  with  fuzzy  Bayesian  method  combined  with
expert  prediction.  Holt-Winters  exponential  smoothing
was  enhanced  by  fruit-fly  optimization  algorithm  in  [39]
and achieved better performance in terms of training and
execution  time,  while  in  [40],  same  method  was  applied
with extreme learning machine with same benefits in short
term  prediction.  Extreme  learning  machine  has  been
applied also in [41] with online search data which lead to
improving  accuracy.  In  [42],  three  ensemble  learning
models are developed and the respective results compared:
gradient  boosted  regression  trees,  random  forests  and  an
adaptation  of  Adaboost,  which  showed  best  accuracy  in
short  term  prediction.  In  [43]  ARIMA  model  with  SVM
was  combined  to  achieve  higher  accuracy  on  targeted
model comparing to single model application. As for the
Neural  network  implementation,  LSTM  dominate  most
cited  papers  in  the  last  three  years,  such  as  [44-47]  and
[48].

In  this  article, the  standard  time  series  methods with
the  modern  machine  learning  methods  are  compared  for
MTLF. This paper includes an analysis of twelve methods.
Used  classical  time  series  models  include  season  naïve,
exponential  smoothing  models,  ARIMA  models,  and
structural  models.  Regarding  machine  learning  methods,
this  article  considered  the  following:  Linear  regression,
Elastic  net,  K-Nearest  neighbours,  Random  forest,
Extreme  gradient  boosting  machine,  Support  vector
machines (linear and radial), and finally the neural network
(neural  network  autoregression).  All  of  the  previously
mentioned  models  are  used  for  regression  problems,  and
wide number of approaches is used intentionally to explore
possible good results of high accuracy with, until now, not
published approach in this domain.

The performances of forecasting models are evaluated
on the monthly electricity consumption data for the period
from January 2000 to March 2020. The first 228 months
are used for training, while the last 15 were used for testing
and  validation.  The  considered  models  calculate  the
forecast  for  the  whole  test  period  from  January  2019  to
March 2020.

A  comparative  analysis  of  such  a  large  number  of
methods  has  not  been  done  so  far  for  MTLF.  As
emphasized  earlier  a  limited  number  of  research  papers
deal with mid-term forecasts of electricity consumption, so
this  analysis  could  be  very  useful,  especially  for
Distribution  System  Operators.  The  electricity  demand
data  considered  in  this  research  are  obtained  from  the
Distribution System Operator (DSO) "Elektrodistribucija"
Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina which is in the final stage of
the  process  of  division  distribution  and  supply.  So,  the
results  of  this  paper  can  give  significant  support  to  the
electric  companies  that  start  to  operate  in  deregulated
electricity markets.

2  MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bosnia and Herzegovina has been an open electricity

market since January 1st, 2015.

Since then, all buyers have a free choice of choosing
an electricity supplier. Supply of the market with electricity
is done by energy stakeholders who are registered for trade
and supply of the Bosnian market with electricity. Supplier
is a name for a utility provider with the permit of electricity
supplying  activity  to  tariff  buyers  and  an  entity  with  the
permit  of  trading  and  supplying  electricity  issued  by  the
regulatory body.

consumption of active energy (in kWh) of high tariff for
metering  points  in  a  time  frame  from  January  2000  to
March 2020. Data is collected from their Data Warehouse,
in  the  form  of  total  monthly  consumption.  First,  data  is
explored  to  find  outliers.  For  outliers’  detection,  Loess’
method  for  decomposition  of  seasonality  and  trend  was
used [49], and several points were detected and eliminated.
After the elimination of the outliers, the missing values are
imputed with linear interpolation. Fig. 1 shows the monthly
electricity  consumption  data  for  the  period  from  2000  to
2018. Detected outliers are presented with dashed lines.

There is a sudden drop in electricity consumption in 2017,
which  makes  precise  forecasting  of  future  electricity

To select the optimal forecasting model, we divide the
data set into two parts: train data is data from 2000 to the
end of 2018. Test data is data of energy consumption for
2019 and the first quartile of 2020.

In the following, the methods and their implementation
used  for  mid-term  forecasting  on  a  given  data  set  are
described.

with Box-Cox transformation in R is used. Auto.arima is
based on the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm [50], which
returns a model with the smallest AIC. The model obtained
by the function is ARIMA(1, 0, 1)(1, 1, 1).

3.3  State-Space Models and ETS

ETS  (Error,  Trend,  Seasonal)  method  is  another
approach for forecasting univariate time series data. It is an
innovation  state-space  model  described  in  [51]  for  every
exponential  smoothing  method.  Predictions  based  on  the
exponential smoothing methods are formed on averages of
previous records but weighted based on their "age" - older
records have lower significance to the prediction than the
newer ones [49]. The exponential smoothing method can
be  represented  as  a  pair  of  trend  and  seasonality
descriptors,  which  can  be  non-existing  (N),  additive  (A),
multiplicative  (M),  or  damped  additive/multiplicative
(Ad/Md), giving 15 different methods [50].

ETS model selection
The function ets() from the forecast package is used,
with Box-Cox transformation, which implements a state-
space  modelling  framework.  The  model  chosen  via
algorithm for our data sets is ETS(A, N, A).

3.4  Structural Time Series Models and the Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter refers to an algorithm for time series
data with state space model descriptors, which recursively
predicts and calculates variance with the strength to predict
in real-time, i.e., to predict a value for the next time point
at  any  part  of  the  model  based  on  the  state-space
descriptors [52].

In this paper, the Kalman filter is applied to the BSM
model, which is a basic structural time series model, which
consists of mutually independent trend, seasonal, and noise
components.  Implementation  is  performed  using  the  R
language.

The structural time series model is a state-space model
by which time series can be decomposed into components:
trend, cycle, seasonal, and noise. Each of these components
is  considered  a  different  space  and  can  be  analysed
separately.

differencing on data before the analysis, the structural time
series  model  allows  getting  the  specific  information  and
identifying  any  characteristics
in  each  explicitly
formulated component. This is the main advantage of the
structural model.

4  MACHINE LEARNING METHODS

Predictions on time-series-based data are a supervised
learning problem. The process of observing different time
frames and applying different models opens the possibility
of  describing  parts  of  data.  The  process  of  training  uses
predictions  on  frames  and  creates  updates  based  on  the
overall or partial result when compared to real data, which
is standard for supervised learning problems. Training of
the  models  is  stopped  when  targeted  performance  is
achieved  [53].  Supervised  learning  problems  are  divided

from DSO in Bosnia and Herzegovina

3  CLASSICAL TIME SERIES FORECASTING MODELS
3.1  Seasonality-Based Naive Method

This  approach  is  often  used  for  data  that  is  highly
seasonal [49]. The method is based on the value of the same
season part in the previous cycle. By y1, y2, ..., yT denote
historical data and by y′ forecasted data. The prediction for
the time T + h can be written as y′
T +h|T = yT+h−m(k+1) where m
is  the  seasonal  part,  h  is  horizon  and  k  is  the  fraction  of
(h ‒ 1)/m, meaning the number of whole time fractions on
which  method  is  based  before  T  +  h.  A  seasonal  naive
forecasting method is implemented in this way in using the
function snaive() from the R package called "forecast". A
seasonal naive forecasting method is often used as starting
point, i.e. the basis, to evaluating any other algorithm. To
produce forecast point, the function snaive() would repeat
the value from the same period a season ago, for example,
to  produce  forecast  for  January  2021,  the  method  would
take the value January 2020.

3.2  Box-Jenkins ARIMA Models

Univariate time series data is most often predicted with
ARIMA models. It is based on the description of historical
data of a single variable and describing the autocorrelation
in  the  data.  The  non-seasonal  model  ARIMA(p,  d,  q)  is
described  with  the  following  three  parameters  p  -  the
number  of  autoregressive  terms,  d  -  the  degree  of
nonseasonal  differences  needed,  and  q  -  the  number  of
lagged  forecast  errors.  Since  ARIMA  models  (p,  q,  d)
cannot be used for data without a seasonal component, a
seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D,
Q)m is formed to support time-series data with a seasonal
component. It contains three new parameters (P, D, Q) to
specify  the  part  of  autoregression,  differencing,  and
moving  average,  and  it  also  adds  a  parameter  m  which
represents the seasonal period [49]. In this paper, the Box-
Jenkins approach is used for model definition and training.
The  procedure  consists  of  data  transformation  and  an
iterative process of model identification, model estimation,
model checking, and forecasting.

ARIMA model selection
To  obtain  the  optimal  ARIMA  model  the  auto.arima
function  from  the  earlier  mentioned  "forecast"  package

into regression problems, where an expected prediction is
an integer-based number and a model is a function with one
numerical  output,  and  classification  problems,  where
expected prediction  is  a  true-false/category-based output.
In order to create a supervised learning problem in time-
series  data,  a  previous  value  can  be  used  as  output  for
future  time  points.  After  choosing  the  variable  for
prediction,  the  feature  engineering  can  define  that  is
informative enough to make a good description of future
time steps [53].

In this paper the class of lag features is used, that is,
the values at prior time steps. The purpose of lag features
is  re-framing  of  time  series  data  in  order  to  observe
previous timeframes as features with the same length and,
possibly,  information.  The  width  of  the  time-frame
window depends on the number of created lagged features
[53].  For  our  data  set  24  lagged  variables  are  created.
Denote them by: t ‒ 1, t ‒ 2, …, t ‒ 24. To estimate  the
relative usefulness of input features two methods are used,
the linear method (lm) and Principal Component Analysis
(PCA).  After  feature  selection,  the  following  machine
learning  methods  are  applied:  Linear  regression,  Elastic
net,  K-Nearest  neighbours,  Random  Forest,  Extreme
gradient  boosting  machine,  and  Support  vector  machine.
The description of these methods can be found in [54].

When  using  linear  method,  student  t-test  shows
significance of t ‒ 1, t ‒ 3, t ‒ 12, t ‒ 22. Thus, those values
will  be  preselected  as  additional  attributes.  To  select
relevant features by PCA method the preProcess function
from  the  caret  package  in  R  is  used.  The  package  caret
(classification and regression training) is used as a tool for
developing initial forecasting models, with the possibility
of  tweaking  the  models  based  on  performance  and
available model parameters. The goal of the caret package
is  fast  model  setup,  training,  and  modification,  with  the
purpose  of  exploring  different  options
regarding
modelling.  Caret  also  covers  pre-processing,  component
analysis, feature selection, and model visualisation.

The  train  function  from  the  caret  package is  used  to
evaluate  the  effect  of  model  tuning  parameters  on
performance,  choose  the  optimal  model  across  these
parameters,  and  estimate  model  performance  from  a
training set using resampling. For the train function from
the  caret  package,  the  possible  resampling  methods  are
bootstrapping,  k-fold  cross-validation,
leave-one-out
leave-group-out  cross-validation
cross-validation,  and
[55].  To  modify  the  resampling  method,  a  trainControl
function  is  used.  The  option method  controls  the  type  of
resampling. For building some models timeslice method is
used,  that  is  time  series  cross-validation  which  is  also
known as "evaluation on a rolling forecasting origin" [56].
Some  of  the  methods,  such  as  Random  Forest  or  Linear
regression  diverged  when  using  cross-validation,  so  the
resampling needed to be done manually. When using the
timeslice  method,  parameters  initialWindow  and  horizon
were  set  in  a  way  that  has  given  the  best  results  on  the
training set. The starting value of repeating values in both
training  and  test  set  are  set  in  favour  of  the  training  set
results.  With  a  window  of  5  years  of  historical  data  (60
lags) and yearly prediction, training of the models gave the
best results.

Neural networks
Neural  networks  are  currently  the  most  popular
methods  for  short-term  consumption  prediction.  It  has
proven  to  be  highly  accurate  when  dealing  with  a  high
number  of  records.  Neural  networks  are  an  artificial
concept based on the human brain. It can be observed as a
though  interconnection  of  "neurons",  brain  cells  in  brain
layers that propagate information between themselves and
further to the surface. The input neurons form the bottom
(first)  layer,  and  the  prediction  forms  the  top  layer
consisting of multiple neurons in a classification problem,
or a single neuron in regression problem modelling. Often,
there are multiple hidden layers, consisting of a network of
neurons used for propagating the knowledge accumulated
in the previous layers of the network [49].

The basic neural network model does not have hidden
layers  and  behaves  as  a  linear  regression  function  with
weights  on  each
input  neuron.  The  weights  (the
coefficients  attached  to  predictors)  are  calculated  in  the
training  process  and  are  based  on  the  learning  algorithm
and the cost function, which ought to be minimized in the
training process [49]. A multilayer perceptron, or MLP, is
a  neural  network  with  at  least  one  hidden  layer,  where
multiple layers of neurons are interconnected in a way that
each  layer  of  nodes  receives  inputs  from  the  previous
layers.  That  approach  to  information  sharing  is  called  a
feed-forward network.

The neural network model where along with the time
series data the lagged values of the data are added as input
is called a neural network autoregression or NNAR model.
In this paper, a three-layer NNAR model for seasonal time
series  data  prediction  is  considered.  A  notation  for  the
model is NNAR (p, P, k)m, where p and P are the numbers
of non-seasonal and seasonal lagged inputs, respectively,
and k is the number of neurons in the hidden layer. [38]. In
this  research  to  fit  NNAR(p,  P,  k)  m  model  the  function
nnetar() function from package forecast in R is used. The
values  of  parameters  p  and  P  are  selected  automatically.
The parameter P is set to 1 by default, p = 3 is chosen from
the optimal linear model fitted to the seasonally adjusted
data and the number of neurons in the hidden layer is set
k = 6.

5  RESULTS

This section presents the forecasting results obtained
by using different models on time series data obtained from
DSO in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Models are applied and
tested to find the optimal forecasting model for this type of
data.  The  electricity  consumption  for  the  period  from
January 2019 to March 2020 is predicted on the monthly
resolution with  historical  data  from  2000  to  2018.  In  the
analysis  of  the  forecasting  results,  the  Mean  absolute
percentage error (MAPE) is measured.

5.1  Forecasts from the Classical Time Series Methods

The forecasting results obtained by the seasonal naïve
model,  ARIMA(1,  0,  1)(1,  1,  1)  model,  ETS(A,  N,  A)
model, and BSM are shown in Fig. 4. It can be noticed that
classical  time  series  methods  ARIMA,  ETS,  and  BSM
perform slightly better than SNAIVE.

The  best  accuracy  according  to  MAPE  is  achieved
with the ETS with MAPE 3.28 %. MAPEs for ARIMA(1,
0, 1)(1, 1, 1) and BSM are 3.36% and 3.87%, respectively.
The seasonal naive model gave MAPE 4.16%.

6  DISCUSION

A  graphical  comparison  of  MAPEs  for  different
methods  is  shown  in  Fig.8.  For  all  models,  error  ranges
between 3% and 8% which is acceptable for application in
practice for MTLF. The NNAR model performed the best
accuracy, with MAPE of 2.67 %. The classical time series
methods  showed  better  accuracy  than  other  machine
learning methods. Having in mind works [36, 37], this was
expected as the sample size is quite small.

To compare absolute relative errors per month, three
methods are chosen (one from each category): ETS(A, N,
A) which showed better accuracy than other classical time
series  methods,  PCA+KNN  which  performed  better  than
other machine learning methods used with PCA or lm, and
the neural network model NNAR(3, 1, 6). The comparison
of absolute relative errors per month for these methods is
given in Tab. 3.  When considering absolute relative errors
per months then the modelsꞌ results can be very different
from each other. Some models give a better prediction for
some months than others. That depends on the models and

Tab. 3 shows that for the months April 2019, August
2019,  and  October  2019  ETS(A,  N,  A)  model  performs
more  accurately  in  forecasting  electricity  consumption
than the other models. For February 2019, May 2019, and
July 2019 the smallest error is achieved by forecasting with
the PCA+KNN, while for January 2019, March 2019, June
2019, September 2019, November 2019, December 2019,
January  2020,  February  2020,  and  March  2020  the  best
results  are  obtained  by  implementing  NNAR(3,  1,  6)
model.  For  July  2019  the  forecasting  from  PCA+KNN
gives  a  much  smaller  error  than  the  other  two  models,
while for September it gives a much larger error than ETS
and NNAR(3, 1, 6). Forecasting from ETS(A, N, A) gives
a very small absolute relative error, less than 1%, for April
2019,  August  2019,  October  2019,  and  December  2019.
The  smallest  absolute  relative  error  with  PCA+KNN  is
achieved  for  April  2019,  while  with  NNAR(3,  1,  6)  the
error of less than 1% is achieved for March 2019, August
2019, September 2019, December 2019, and January 2020.
The largest deviations of the NNAR(3, 1, 6) model, above
5%,  are  obtained  for  the  months  of  May,  July,  and

November  2019.  PCA+KNN  is  at  least  accurate  for
January,  September,  November  2019,  and  March  2020.
For May 2019, November 2019, February 2020 and March
2020 ETS(A, N ,A) showed the smallest accuracy. For all
three  models,  the  obtained  MAPE  for  the  month  of
November  is  larger  than  7%,  and  the  MAPEs  of  these
methods are the most comparable for this month.

Although, the MAPE is the main chosen indicator for
selecting the best forecasting model in this paper, absolute
relative errors per month can provide an additional insight
that  can  be  useful  for  DSO  special  applications,  such  as
comparison of errors per month or seasons.

7  CONCLUSION

In this paper, twelve different methods for MTLF are
compared to see which method gives the best results and
whether  the  errors  obtained  by  using  these  methods  are
comparable. An exhaustive comparative analysis of such a
large  number  of  methods  has  not  been  done  so  far  for
MTLF.  The  analysis  given  in  this  paper  could  be  very
useful for further analysis and improvement of methods for
MTLF and gives significant support to the electric utilities
that plan to operate in deregulated electricity markets.

The efficiency of provided models is competitive with
the  current  publicly  available  models  in  the  terms  of
accuracy  and  their  application  in  the  real  market,  thus  it
represents  contribution  to  the  academia  and  energy
community.

It  can  be  concluded  that  for  this  type  of  data,  time
series  models  perform  better  than  classical  machine
learning  methods.  Even  though  the  best  results  were
expected  from  neural  networks,  it  can  be  concluded  that
MTLF does not have enough data to create the model with
significant accuracy.

Comparing  to  overviewed  references,  the  future
progress could be made with combining several methods
into  one  model,  since  newest  publications  show  biggest
improvements  in  performance  and  accuracy  in  that  way.
Comparing  to  above  mentioned  references,  MAPE  of
3.28% with ETS model is competitive, but authors cannot
make  final  conclusions  and  comparisons  with  other
publications, since the dataset needs to be the same in order
to do so.

Future  work  should  focus  on  creating  a  general
algorithm for choosing the right model for MTLF on any
kind of consumption data and improving data quality with
pre-processing and analysis.

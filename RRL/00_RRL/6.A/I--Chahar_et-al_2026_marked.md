Abstract

The rising complexity of financial systems, combined with limited financial literacy and inadequate
budgeting tools, poses significant challenges for individuals in managing personal finances effectively.
Existing personal finance solutions often rely on static budgeting methods and offer generic
investment guidance, lacking adaptability and personalization. This paper proposes an AI-powered
personal finance assistant that leverages machine learning (ML) and natural language processing
(NLP) to deliver dynamic, user-specific financial insights. The assistant is designed to generate
tailored budget recommendations, provide financial education aligned with user proficiency levels,
and ensure secure financial data handling through advanced encryption protocols. The proposed
system addresses current limitations in financial management tools by integrating real-time data
analysis, user-context adaptation, and educational content delivery. A systematic literature review
and preliminary prototype development validate the feasibility and potential impact of this approach
in improving financial literacy, promoting sound financial decisions, and securing user financial well-
being.

1.  Introduction

In  an  era  defined  by  digital  transformation  and  intelligent  systems,  financial  literacy  and
personal financial management remain critical aspects of an individual's well-being. However,
managing finance effectively has become increasingly complex due to evolving income models,
diverse  investment  opportunities,  fluctuating  markets,  and  changing  consumer  behaviors.
Traditional  financial management  tools,  such  as  spreadsheets  or  manual  budgeting,  often  fall
short  in  providing  real-time  insights,  adaptability,  or  predictive  capabilities.  Consequently,
individuals may struggle with financial planning, leading to poor savings habits, increased debt,
and a lack of preparedness for financial emergencies.

Recent  advances  in  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  have  introduced  new  possibilities  for

transforming personal finance management.

Recent  advances  in  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  have  introduced  new  possibilities  for
transforming  personal  finance  management.  AI  systems  can  now  learn  from  vast  datasets,
understand  individual  spending  patterns,  provide  predictive  insights,  and  offer  tailored
financial  advice  with  minimal  human  intervention.  AI-powered  personal  finance  applications
are capable of not just tracking expenses, but also anticipating future needs, alerting users to
risky  behaviors,  and  suggesting  strategic  financial  actions  based  on  personalized  financial
goals. By integrating machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics, these
systems offer a more dynamic, responsive, and intelligent alternative to traditional budgeting
tools.

The  need  for  an  AI-powered  personal  finance  management  system  is  more  pressing  than
ever. With the rise of gig economy workers, freelancers, remote jobs, and decentralized finance
(DeFi)  platforms,  users  require  tools  that  can  adapt  to  diverse  income  streams  and
unconventional  financial  portfolios.  Additionally,  the  post-pandemic  world  has  brought
heightened  awareness  of  financial  resilience,  prompting  individuals  to  seek  smarter,
technology-driven  methods  for  managing  personal  finances.  AI  can  bridge  the  gap  between
financial  illiteracy  and  financial  empowerment  by  automating  complex  tasks  such  as
categorizing  expenses,  forecasting  budgets,  analyzing  credit  scores,  and  even  detecting
anomalies that may indicate fraud or identity theft.

Despite the existence of several financial management tools, most current systems lack true
intelligence  or  are  limited  by  static  rule-based  designs.  Furthermore,  many  existing
applications do not prioritize user privacy, adaptability, or educational value, often providing
generic  advice  that  fails  to  consider  a  user’s  financial  history,  behavior,  or  goals.  Therefore,
there is a clear opportunity to design and develop an AI-powered system that not only assists
users  in  managing  their  finances  but  also  educates  and  empowers  them  through  intelligent
automation and personalized insights.

This  paper  presents  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  AI-  Powered  Personal  Finance
Management System aimed at helping users gain better control over  their financial lives. The
proposed system leverages machine learning algorithms for expense classification, forecasting,
and  user  behavior  analysis.  It  also  incorporates  recommendation  models  to  provide
personalized financial advice and integrates with real-time data sources to ensure accuracy and
relevance. The primary objective is to create a system that is user-friendly, secure, and capable
of providing actionable insights to users with varying levels of financial literacy.

In  the  following  sections,  we  delve  into  the  related  work,  system  architecture,  core  AI
methodologies,  implementation  details,  performance  evaluation,  and  future  directions  of  the
proposed system. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be
effectively  harnessed  to  promote  better  financial  decision-  making  and  long-term  financial
wellness for individuals.

2.  LITERATURE REVIEW

The  increasing  adoption  of  digital  financial  tools  has  sparked  significant  research  interest  in
personal  finance  management  systems  enhanced  by  artificial  intelligence.  This  section  surveys
relevant  existing  studies  and  systems,  highlighting  their  approaches,  strengths,  and  limitations,
thereby establishing the context for the proposed AI- powered solution.

Early  personal  finance  management  systems  primarily  focused  on  basic  expense  tracking  and
budgeting  functionalities.  These  systems,  often  rule-based  and  static,  lacked  the  ability  to  adapt
dynamically  to  users’  changing  financial  behaviors.  For  example,  applications  like  Quicken  and
Microsoft Money provided users with tools to manually input financial data and generate reports,

but  they  did  not  incorporate  advanced  analytics  or  predictive  modeling[1].  As  digital  finance
evolved, the demand for smarter, more interactive tools grew.

With  the  advent  of  machine  learning  (ML),  recent  studies  have  explored  automated  expense
classification  and  anomaly  detection  in  personal  finance.  Machine  learning  algorithms  such  as
decision  trees,  support  vector  machines,  and  neural  networks  have  been  utilized  to  categorize
transactions based on descriptions and amounts with high accuracy [2]. These classification models
help  users  visualize  spending  habits  by  grouping  expenses  into  meaningful  categories,  which  is
fundamental for budget management. However, many models rely heavily on supervised learning,
requiring large, labeled datasets that may not be readily available for all users, limiting scalability.
Predictive  analytics  has  also  gained  traction  in  the  domain  of  personal  finance.  Time  series
forecasting models,  including  ARIMA  and Long  Short-  Term Memory  (LSTM)  networks,  have  been
applied to predict future expenses or cash flow trends [3]. Such predictive capabilities enable users
to  plan  budgets  proactively,  anticipate  financial  shortfalls,  and  make
informed  decisions.
Nevertheless,  existing  predictive  models  often  struggle  with  the  inherent  variability  in  individual
spending  patterns,  especially  when  faced  with  irregular  income  streams  common  in  gig  economy
workers.

Recommendation systems in personal finance management have utilized collaborative filtering
and  content-based methods  to  provide  users  with  personalized  saving tips,  investment  advice,  or
credit score improvement strategies [4]. These systems aim to tailor financial guidance to individual
user  profiles  and  goals,  enhancing  engagement  and  relevance.  However,  challenges  remain  in
balancing  personalization with  privacy, as  sensitive  financial  data  needs  robust  protection  against
misuse or breaches.

 Natural  language  processing  (NLP)  has  been  employed  to  improve  user  interaction  within
financial  applications.  Chatbots  and  virtual  assistants  capable  of  understanding  user  queries  and
providing real-time financial advice have been demonstrated in recent research[5]. These interfaces
reduce  barriers  for  users  unfamiliar  with  complex  financial  terminology  and  foster  ongoing  user
engagement.  Yet,  such  conversational  systems  are  still  limited  by  their  ability  to  handle  nuanced
financial scenarios and often require continuous updates to maintain accuracy.

Several  commercial  apps  like  Mint,  YNAB  (You  Need  a  Budget),  and  Pocket  Guard  incorporate
some  AI  features  but  primarily  depend  on  predefined  rules  and  heuristics  rather  than  adaptive
learning models. Moreover, the lack of transparency in how these apps process data and generate
recommendations raises concerns about trust and accountability.

A.  Web-based Financial Applications
Financial workflows can be streamlined using automation features provided by web-based
platforms. Using PHP and MySQL [6] created an online application for a board planning house
in Indonesia to combine billing, auditing, budgeting, and planning. They were also overcoming
the  drawbacks  of  manual  bookkeeping,  usability  tests,  security,  and  comparisons  with  other
solutions that need improvement. Using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and AJAX [7] demonstrated a
responsive university budget administration system.

B.  Personal Budgeting Research
Making a personal budget is a crucial yet challenging financial process. Galperti investigated
theoretic connections between consumption-saving biases and bud- getting. However, further
research  is  required  to  ensure  consistency  in  real-world  budget  adherence  and  tracking
initiatives.  Individual  prejudices  and  perceptions  of  trade-offs  can  influence  particular
budgeting  strategies.  Financial  results  could  be  improved  by  more  research  on  how  to
overcome budgeting challenges.

C.  Financial Literacy Initiatives
Better financial literacy is essential for making decisions as financial systems become more
complex.  According  to  Molina  et  al.[8]  university  students'  risk  tolerance  and  literacy  were
negatively  correlated,  supporting  the  need  for  educational  interventions.  The  importance  of
literacy in navigating Indian financial systems was highlighted by Rath and Patra  [9]. Deficits
were  found  when  Dube  and  Asthana  [10]  examined  the  knowledge,  abilities,  and  behavioral
components  of  Indian  pupils.  Financial  knowledge  is  essential  for  risk  avoidance  and  money
management in all situations.

D.  AI Applications in Finance
The  integration  of  finance  is  gaining  momentum  as  AI  advances.  Cao  [11]  thoroughly
examined  AI  strategies,  classifying  analytics  and  learning  approaches  that  support  financial
tasks,  but  failing  to  handle  constraints.  Comparisons  revealed  that  cutting-edge  approaches
enhanced  conventional  procedures  rather  than  replaced  them.  In  particular  Waliszewski,  K.
and Warchlewska,  A.  [12]  investigated  consumer  acceptability  of  AI  finance  tools  and
discovered  demographic  differences.  For  the  implementation  of  AI  financial  solutions  to  be
effective, user surveys are still essential.

3.  METHODOLOGY

This section describes the overall approach and techniques employed to design and develop
the  AI-Powered  Personal  Finance  Management  System.  The  methodology  focuses  on
integrating  artificial  intelligence  components  that  collectively  facilitate  automated  expense
classification,  predictive  financial  analytics,  personalized  recommendations,  and  natural
language interaction. Additionally, attention is given to data security and user privacy.

A.  System Overview
The  system  is  designed  as  a  modular  architecture  composed  of  the  following  core

components:

  Data  Collection  and  Integration  Module:  Aggregates  financial  data  from  multiple
sources including bank transactions, credit card statements, digital wallets, and user
inputs.

  Expense  Classification  Engine:  Applies  machine  learning  models  to  categorize
transactions automatically into predefined categories (e.g., food, transport, utilities).
  Predictive  Analytics  Module:  Utilizes  time  series  forecasting  to  predict  future

expenses and income flows, enabling proactive financial planning.

  Recommendation  System:  Generates  personalized  financial  advice  and  budgeting

tips based on user behavior, goals, and predictive insights.

  Natural Language Processing Interface: Provides a conversational interface allowing

users to interact with the system through queries and commands.

  Security  and  Privacy  Layer:  Implements  encryption,  anonymization,  and  access

control to protect sensitive user data.

B. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Financial  data  is  collected  via  secure  API  connections  to  banking  institutions  or  manually
uploaded CSV files. Raw data undergoes preprocessing steps including normalization, missing value
handling, and feature extraction. Transaction descriptions are cleaned by removing special characters
and stop words to enhance the performance of classification models.

C. Expense Classification
The classification engine employs supervised machine learning algorithms to assign each transac-
tion  to  appropriate  categories.  Initially,  a  labeled  dataset  of  transactions  is  used  to  train  several
models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a deep learning-based Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential text analysis.
Model training involves:
•
•
scriptions.
•

Feature engineering on transaction metadata (amount, date, merchant name).
Text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to represent transaction de-

Cross-validation to select the model with the best accuracy and generalization

D. Security and Privacy Measures
Given the sensitivity of financial data, the system incorporates robust security mechanisms:
End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control to restrict data access.
Anonymization techniques during model training to prevent data leakage.
Compliance with data privacy standards such as GDPR.

We  incorporated  various  components  in  our  project  development  including  React.js  alongside
Flask and MongoDB along with Firebase based on their specialized features. The frontend user in-
terface  (UI)  implementation  with  act.js  simplifies  dynamic  interface  development  to  create inter-
faces that deliver both user responsiveness and  engaging experiences. Its component-based struc-
ture  makes  building  and  maintaining  the  user  interface  effective  thus  delivering  smooth  money
management services to users.

The backend framework uses Flask to accomplish machine learning operations. Through its simpli-
fied  approach  Flask  enables  developers  to  build  dependable  web-based  operations.  The  callable
framework of this system makes it easy to incorporate machine learning models while enhancing
both analytical procedures and forecasting accuracy.

The application utilizes Flask components for machine learning operations and backend manage-
ment and pairs them with React.js for frontend UI development and MongoDB for database work
and Firebase for authentication and real-time functions. AI engines enable this personal finance as-
sistant to provide an effective platform which effectively manages user finances through data syn-
chronization.

4.  EMERGING TRENDS IN AI FOR PERSONAL FINANCE

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are reshaping personal financial practices due to continuing
rapid  technological  advancements.  Financial  institutions  now  combine  virtual assistants with AI-
powered chatbots as one main advancement in this field. These smart technologies modernize cus-

tomer service by offering live answers to customer questions while facilitating transactions and de-
livering customized financial advice. AI chatbots interact with users by using natural language pro-
cessing  to  provide  individualized  suggestions  matched  to  their  financial  profiles  and  goals.  Cus-
tomers experience faster financial transactions and inquiries together with enhanced service quality
as a result of heightened interaction with AI- powered forms of customer service [8].
A.  AI-powered Customer Service Enhancement
The  Financial  institutions  continue  to  integrate  AI-powered  chatbots  and  virtual  assistants  for  a
consistent modernization of their customer service systems. The devices utilize standard language
conversations to provide individualized financial guidance and transaction management and query
responses to their users. These chatbots utilize their natural language processing infrastructure to
give users improved satisfaction during banking transactions that process quickly and produce tai-
lored advice based on client financial objectives and information.

B.  Integration of AI into Personal Expense Management Platforms
People  transform  their  financial  tracking  methods  because  personal  financial  management  tools
now incorporate AI technologies. Real-time financial data analysis through AI algorithms operates
on large data sets to provide customers with valuable insights into their expenditure habits and in-
vestment returns and progress toward financial targets. Through interactive dashboards and visuali-
zation tools these platforms allow users to track their financial health while identifying spending
patterns and making best choices in investing and budgeting and saving [9].
C.  Rise of AI-driven Predictive Analytics
Modern  AI  predictive  analytics  through  sophisticated  machine  learning  algorithms  transforms
personal financial planning by using past data analysis to reveal market trends for exceptional fu-
ture  market  prediction  accuracy  [13].  Users  leverage  predictive  analytics  driven  by  AI  to  make
ahead investment decisions as well as optimize their portfolio distributions while decreasing risk
through price asset and market force forecasts. Through predictive capabilities users can change
traditional wealth generation practices and investment portfolio management approaches to seize
better market opportunities while navigating volatile conditions [4].

D.  Personalized Financial Planning Solutions
Customized  financial  planning  emerges  from  AI-powered  personal  finance  tools  through  as-
sessing what users prefer and demand. AI systems analyze users' financial spending  activities to-
gether with their income patterns and their  recorded life changes. The systems will provide de-
tailed instructions about debt control and savings together with budget guidelines. Users develop
strategic financial plans through tailor-made insights which help them achieve their long-term ob-
jectives while adapting to changing conditions  [1].

5.  Potential impact on personal financial management

Personal financial  planning  underwent  a  significant behavioral  transformation following  the  de-
ployment  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  into  customer  financial  interactions.  AI-  powered  robo-
advisors  through  the  financial  services  industry  deliver  retail  investors  access  to  professional
wealth  management  services  at  affordable  costs  following  the  healthcare  industry's  example.

Figure 5 User engagement growth with personal finance management system

Through robo-advisors powered by AI clients gain access to automated rebalancing functions
as  well  as  continuous  system  monitoring  and  individually  tailored  portfolio  construction.  These
advanced portfolio features deliver peak operational results while ensuring effective alignment be-
tween strategic financial goals and personal targets.

Artificial intelligence systems aimed at personal financial  fraud protection now operate with im-
proved  security  measures  to  stop  suspicious  conduct  and  unauthorized  transactions  and  prevent
identity  takeovers.  Systems  process  data  to  rapidly  find  irregular  behavior  which  then  triggers
alerts  for  users  alongside  alerts  sent  to  financial  institutions.  Financial  ecosystem  credibility  in-
creases  through  asset  protection  which  drives  digital  transaction  confidence  among  users  when
adopting this proactive detection approach. Robo-advisors alongside fraud detection systems rep-
resent  only  one  usage  of  artificial  intelligence  in  personal  financial  planning.  Individuals  make
better financial choices through data-driven resources  which  maximize  profits  while  minimizing
risks [13].

6.  RESULTS AND EVALUATION

This section presents the outcomes of the developed system and evaluates its performance across
key functionalities including expense classification accuracy, predictive forecasting reliability, rec-
ommendation relevance, and user experience. The evaluation aims to determine the system’s prac-
tical effectiveness in supporting intelligent and personalized financial management.

A.  Evaluation Metrics

In this project, multiple performance metrics were used to assess the effectiveness of the AI models
and the overall system. These include:

i.

Accuracy and Precision (For Transaction Categorization)

•  Accuracy  measures  the  percentage  of  efficaciously  categorized transactions in a given da-
taset. The accuracy of the transaction categorization version is critical because it immediately
influences  how  well  the  device  can  classify  spending  into  beneficial  classes  like  "groceries,"
"enjoyment," or "utilities."

•  Precision evaluates the version's capability to avoid fake positives (misclassifying transac-
tions into wrong classes). Excessive precision is vital for making sure that the system presents
users with sincere categorizations to assist them with music spending and manipulate budgets.

ii.  Mean  Absolute  blunders (MAE)  (For  Spending Prediction)

Suggest Absolute mistakes measure the difference among anticipated and real spending amounts.
MAE  is  a  vital  metric  for  assessing  the  accuracy  of  the  machine’s  monetary  forecasting.  A  low
MAE suggests that the device’s predictions for destiny expenses are close to the actual values.

iii.

F1-rating (For finances Allocation Optimization)

•  The F1-score is used to assess the overall performance of models tasked with optimizing
finances  allocation  and  suggesting  saving  strategies.  This  metric  is  beneficial  whilst  the  da-
taset  has  an imbalanced distribution  (e.g., some  budget  categories like "financial savings"
may be much less frequent than "spending"). The F1-score balances precision and consid-
eration, making sure that the system doesn’t prioritize one kind of mistakes over any other.

B.  Discussion of Results

Typically, the AI-powered non-public finance control machine completed properly in categoriz-
ing transactions, predicting spending, and imparting relevant monetary advice.  However, sever-
al challenges have been recognized all  through the evaluation segment:

Figure 6 Distribution of Expenses across Transaction Types
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=6377518

  Records first-class: The accuracy of predictions and suggestions was motivated via  the
exceptional of input facts. Incomplete or misguided transaction records  ought to cause
less dependable effects.

  Model  Adaptability:  The  device  accomplished  well  for  users  with  stable  earnings  and
predictable  expenses, however,  struggled  to  offer  tailor-made  hints  for  users  with
relatively fluctuating earnings or abnormal spending patterns.

7.  CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS

AI  integration  for  personal  expense  management  shows  great  promise  to  transform  money  han-
dling yet numerous impediments prevent it from achieving its potential thrust. Personal finance ap-
plications of AI require successful  ethical implementation through deep understanding of their as-
sociated problems.

A. User Trust and Adoption
People  find  it  hard  to  grant  trust  in  AI-driven  financial  solutions  and  hence  hinder  widespread
adoption. Users hesitate to welcome technical advancements particularly within their finances be-
cause they fear errors together with Hourly Problem-Solving Model and system instability[14]. For
building trust with users about AI systems we should  provide simple interfaces alongside clear ex-
planations of AI algorithms and present its positive and negative features openly. AI-driven solu-
tions will reach wider adoption when users experience quantifiable benefits through satisfying sys-
tem interfaces [4].

B.  Data Quality and Accessibility
The effectiveness of AI-based personal financial management depends dramatically on the caliber
of data provided together with its accessibility. Some people  struggle to get high-quality financial
information  either  because  they  cannot  access  financial  services  or  because  they  don't  want  to
share their money details. The  aggregation process coupled with analysis becomes more challeng-
ing when personal financial data is separate. All  stakeholders, including financial institutions and
regulators and consumers alongside fintech businesses, must unite their efforts to develop technical
frameworks which ensure both data sharing processes and privacy protection mechanisms as well as
interoperability standards to resolve data accessibility and quality challenges.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=6377518

C.  Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management
The financial legislation encompasses three key sectors of criteria known as Know Your Customer
provisions that require financial organizations along with fintech businesses to maintain strict rules
for  data  management  and  customer  privacy  safeguards  while  promoting  transaction  transparen-
cy[15].  Unintended  effects  alongside  algorithmic  bias  and  model  drift  stand  as  new  challenges
which  AI  algorithms  potentially  advance  in  the  financial  industry.  Proper  control  of  these  risks
serves to minimize potential adverse effects for our customers and financial system stability.

D.  Digital Inclusion and Accessibility
To advance financial inclusion along with empowerment it is essential to give everyone equal op-
portunities to use AI- powered  financial  resources.  Technology  gaps  combined with limited in-
ternet connectivity and minimal digital  literacy adoption create obstacles for marginalized people
wanting  to  access financial  services.  AI  algorithms  can  inadvertently  perpetuate already  present
discriminatory  practices  because  these  algorithms  deliver  dissimilar  results  across  population
segments. To achieve digital accessibility alongside inclusive design we must create AI solutions
that deliver user-friendly experiences while recognizing cultural contexts and adjusting to cater to
diverse preferences for users of all ability levels including people with disabilities and those lack-
ing technical expertise.

8.  EXPECTED OUTCOMES

The  Personal  Finance  Management  System  project  typically  incorporates  transaction  records
along  with  user  profile  data  as  well  as  budgeting  information  alongside  additional  information
about  saving  and investments. The  combination  of transaction  IDs  and  quantities  and  dates  and
types  and  categories  (food,  rent,  or  utilities)  and  payment  methods  and  vendor  names  contains
transaction data. Budgeting data reveals projected and actual spending changes by  category, yet
user information can contain unidentified identifiers and income ranges and specific financial tar-
gets. User-controlled saving and investment parameters monitor both investment assets and dura-
tions and interest rates. The system extracts data from three potential sources: manual entry, fi-
nancial application exports and bank feeds.

The following results are anticipated by the suggested AI- powered personal finance assistant:

  Using automated data aggregation and analysis gives users a thorough picture of their

financial situation.

  Using  machine  learning  techniques,  create  customized  and  adaptive  budgets  based  on

customers' spending habits and revenue sources.

  Incorporate  educational  modules  on  subjects  like  investing,  saving,  and  budgeting  to

raise users' financial literacy.

9.  Conclusion and future scope

This paper recommends building artificial intelligence-  based personal expense management tools
to  resolve  increasing  financial  management  complications.  This  proposed  solution  implements
modern  technological  elements  including  machine  learning  along  with  natural  language  pro-
cessing through an extensive web-based  system.
The research objectives facilitate consumer education through informed financial decisions which
enable goal achievement while securing their future prosperity. Successfully maintaining personal
financial management tools depends heavily on user satisfaction since it determines continuous sys-
tem use. The system's performance accuracy together with its utility function and ability to meet
user financial management needs proves fundamental.

In end, the AI-powered private Finance management gadget has validated to be a precious tool for

lives, make informed decisions, and enhance their economic balance.

At  the  same  time  as  there  are  demanding  situations  that  want  to  be  addressed,  especially  round
managing irregular  financial information and increasing the device’s skills to provide greater ad-
vanced monetary offerings, the progress made up to now is encouraging. Future upgrades, consist-
ing of the adoption of extra advanced fashions, actual-time statistics integration, and improved pro-
tection capabilities, will help the machine turn out to be a more complete tool that caters to the var-
ious wishes of customers.

The long-term fulfillment of the gadget will depend upon non-stop development, responsiveness to
person  comments,  and  the  capacity  to  adapt  to  changing  economic  landscapes  and  technological
advancements.  With  these  improvements,  the  device  has  the  capacity  to  come  to  be  an  essential
device for private finance management, helping users reap their monetary goals and navigate their
monetary futures with self-assurance.

High satisfaction was shown by the survey results, with favorable comments given to important ar-
eas  including  goal-setting  functionality  (4.3/5),  correctness  of  transaction  categorization  (4.2/5),
and convenience of use (average  score of 4.5/5). The system's user-friendly layout and the ability
to customize budgets according to spending habits were especially well-liked by users. There were,
nevertheless, certain parts that needed work. The accuracy of  transaction  classification  was  ques-
tioned by a few users, particularly when dealing with unclear or vendor-specific transactions. Addi-
tionally, recommendations were made to increase the accuracy of spending predictions, especially
for  variable  or  non-recurring  costs  like  meals.  Notwithstanding  these  shortcomings,  the  system's
overall satisfaction rating  of 4.4/5 showed that it successfully satisfied users' financial management
requirements and offered insightful  information for future improvements.

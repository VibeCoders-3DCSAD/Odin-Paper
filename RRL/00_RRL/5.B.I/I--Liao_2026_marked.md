Abstract: The dynamic, evolving, and inherently non-stationary characteristics of modern network
environments present a fundamental challenge to traditional intrusion detection systems that rely
on  static  learning  paradigms.  As  network  traffic  patterns,  system  usage  behaviors,  and  threat
manifestations continuously change over time, the statistical properties underlying detection data
are prone to both explicit and implicit variations, commonly described as concept drift. Such drift
leads  to  a  gradual mismatch  between previously learned models  and  current  data  distributions,
resulting  in  performance  degradation,  delayed  responses,  and  reduced  practical  effectiveness  of
fixed  detection  mechanisms.  To  address  these  limitations  and  support  the  construction  of  an
intelligent defense system with long-term adaptability, this study conducts a systematic theoretical
investigation into dynamic intrusion detection from the perspective of learning evolution. On this
basis, a unified framework is proposed that tightly integrates concept drift detection mechanisms
with incremental learning strategies, enabling models to identify distributional changes in a timely
manner and update their knowledge without retraining from scratch. The framework emphasizes
continuity,  stability,  and  adaptability,  aiming  to  balance  detection  accuracy  with  computational
efficiency under continuously changing conditions. By clarifying the internal relationship between
drift  detection  and  incremental  model  updating,  this  work  provides  a  structured  theoretical
foundation  for  the  development  of  adaptive  intrusion  detection  systems  capable  of  maintaining
robust performance in complex and evolving network scenarios.

1. Research Background

Presently, information networks have become the core infrastructure underpinning
societal operations, with their security and stability being of paramount importance. The
security  landscape  within  cyberspace  is  exhibiting  increasingly  severe  complexity  and
dynamism. Attack techniques continually evolve, progressing from large-scale scanning
and  exploitation  of  known  vulnerabilities  to  highly  customized  advanced  persistent
threats  and  covert  attacks  leveraging  artificial  intelligence.  Concurrently,  the  network
environment  itself  undergoes  constant  transformation  due  to  the  deployment  of  new
services,  equipment  upgrades,  and  shifts  in  user  behavior  patterns. This dual dynamic
evolution of attack methods and network environments gives rise to a fundamental issue:
the concepts underlying network traffic data are not static but undergo drift over time [1].
Against  this  backdrop,  traditional  intrusion  detection  systems  based  on  static
learning  paradigms  face  a  fundamental  theoretical  dilemma.  Data  during  training  and
deployment phases are assumed to follow identical probability distributions. However,
the reality of concept drift utterly undermines this assumption. Over time, static models
gradually  become  obsolete,  their  discriminative capabilities  steadily  deteriorating.  This
forces  security  administrators  to  periodically  collect  fresh  data,  retrain,  and  redeploy

models - a resource-intensive process with inherent latency that proves cumbersome and
inefficient against rapidly evolving threats.

Concept drift detection and incremental learning, as two key technological directions,
each  offer  partial  solutions.  Concept  drift  detection  aims  to  identify  moments  of
significant shift in data distribution by monitoring data streams or model performance,
its core value lying in providing awareness of when change occurs. Incremental learning
focuses  on  how  models  can  continuously  learn  new  knowledge  from  incoming  data
without  forgetting  existing  knowledge,  its  core  value  being  the  provision  of  adaptive
updating capabilities. Consequently, constructing a dynamic intrusion detection system
framework  that  deeply  integrates  concept  drift  detection  and  incremental  learning
theories holds urgent theoretical significance and practical value. Thoroughly exploring
the  theoretical foundations, coupling  mechanisms,  and coordination  strategies  for their
fusion  is  not  only  the  inevitable  path  to  overcoming  the  limitations  of  current  static
detection  models  but  also  the  key  to  enabling  intelligent  security  systems  to  possess
sustainable evolutionary capabilities. This lays a solid theoretical foundation for building
a genuine cyber defense system.

2. Theoretical Overview

2.1. Theoretical Framework for Concept Drift Detection

Within the context of network intrusion detection, the core objective of the theoretical
framework  for  concept  drift  detection  lies  in  constructing  a  mathematical  and
computational framework capable of automatically identifying fundamental shifts in data
generation  mechanisms  [2].  This  approach  does  not  merely  monitor  fluctuations  in
network  traffic  metrics,  but  rather  seeks  to  discern  the  underlying  rules  driving  traffic
generation.

Fundamentally, concept drift detection theory follows two parallel logical pathways.
The first involves direct monitoring based on data distribution. This approach assumes
that during conceptually stable periods, observed network traffic characteristics or their
latent  representations  fluctuate  around  a  stable  statistical  distribution.  A  significant
deviation  from  this  underlying  distribution  signals  potential  new  attack  patterns  or
alterations in normal network behavior. The second approach involves indirect inference
based on model performance. This theory employs the detection model itself as a probe,
continuously  evaluating  its  classification  performance  on  the  latest  data.  A  sustained
decline in model performance, particularly abrupt deterioration in specific categories, is
regarded  as  compelling  evidence  of  concept  drift.  This  indicates  that  the  decision
boundaries relied upon by the model are no longer applicable to the current environment.
Statistical  process  control  theory  treats  data  streams  or  model  error  rates  as  time-
varying  sequences.  By  employing  tools such as control  charts,  it  establishes  confidence
intervals or control limits. Should the cumulative deviation or instantaneous value of the
sequence exceed predefined theoretical thresholds, a drift alert is triggered. Its advantages
lie in its formal simplicity and computational efficiency, rendering it particularly suited
for detecting sudden, abrupt shifts-such as the abrupt emergence of novel attacks within
a network [3].

Hypothesis  testing  formalizes  drift  detection  as  a  rigorous  statistical  hypothesis
testing problem. Its core involves constructing two data windows and proposing a null
hypothesis  that  both  windows  originate  from  the  same  distribution.  By  calculating
statistics  such  as  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test,  chi-squared  test,  or  distance-based
metrics,  it  assesses  the  confidence  level  for  rejecting  the  null  hypothesis,  thereby
conferring statistical interpretability upon detection outcomes.

Ensemble difference metric theory employs machine learning models themselves as
sensors  for  distributional  divergence.  A  typical  approach  involves  using  two  or  more
learners to monitor performance differences between reference and new data, or directly
training  a  classifier  to  distinguish  between  old  and  new  data.  The  discriminative

capability of this classifier reflects the degree of distributional divergence between the two
datasets,  enabling  capture  of  nonlinear  changes  in  high-dimensional,  complex  feature
spaces and demonstrating good sensitivity to gradual drift.

2.2. Theoretical Framework of Incremental Learning

From a formal definition perspective, incremental learning addresses an infinite or
extremely lengthy data sequence. Upon receiving a new data batch at each time step, the
model must complete its update immediately or within a finite timeframe, preparing to
process the subsequent batch. Consequently, the core of incremental learning theory lies
in  investigating  how  to  achieve  efficient  and  stable  knowledge  accumulation  under
conditions where partial historical information is either missing or irreproducible [4].

The core theoretical challenge confronting this framework is the stability-plasticity
dilemma.  Stability  denotes  a  model's  capacity  to  retain  acquired  knowledge,  while
plasticity  signifies  its  ability  to  adapt  to  new  information.  Excessive  stability  leads  to
rigidity, rendering the model incapable of learning emerging attack patterns; conversely,
excessive  plasticity  induces  forgetting,  causing  previously  identified  attacks  to  be
misclassified as normal.

Consequently,  incremental  learning  theory  has  developed  several  core  solution
paradigms.  Firstly,  regularization-based  approaches  impose  constraints  on  parameter
updates  by  introducing  additional  regularization  terms  into  the  loss  function.  Their
theoretical  core  lies  in  identifying  and  preserving  parameters  crucial  for  old  tasks.
Secondly, dynamic architecture-based approaches permit the model's structure to expand
or adjust as new tasks or knowledge emerge.

Thirdly, replay-based approaches. Systems maintain a finite-capacity memory buffer
storing  representative  samples  of  past  data  or  their  features.  When  learning  new  data,
samples  from this  buffer  are  mixed  with fresh data  for  training,  periodically replaying
historical patterns.

3. Theoretical Modelling of Framework Components for Dynamic Intrusion Detection

3.1. Formalization of Intrusion Detection Problems in Dynamic Environments

The  theoretical  modelling  of  traditional  intrusion  detection  systems  rests  upon  an
idealized assumption that the world is static. At a specific point in time, sufficient network
traffic  data  is  collected  to  represent  all  future  possible  scenarios,  from  which  a  fixed,
optimal discrimination rule is learned. Once established, these rules are deployed as static
filters,  expected  to  remain  effective  indefinitely.  Consequently,  the  primary  task  in
formalizing intrusion detection for dynamic environments is to abandon the assumption
of a static, closed world entirely, instead acknowledging and embracing the reality of a
dynamic, open world. Within this new theoretical paradigm, intrusion detection ceases to
be a mathematical optimization problem solvable in a single instance, becoming instead a
continuous, never-ending process of adaptation.

Attack  patterns  exhibit  non-stationarity.  Novel  attack  vectors  emerge  from
unforeseen  directions,  while  established  methods  undergo  camouflage  and
metamorphosis  to  evade  detection.  The  set  of  anomalies  or  attack  categories  a  system
must  recognize  is  not a static  catalogue,  but  a dynamic collection where  new members
continually emerge and old ones may reappear in disguised forms. Natural drift in normal
behavior  baselines  corresponds  to  deliberate  alterations  by  attackers.  The  protected
network  environment  itself  undergoes  legitimate,  organic  evolution.  Deploying  new
applications,  updating  software  versions,  shifting  user  behavior  patterns,  and  even
adjusting network architecture all cause gradual yet persistent changes in the statistical
characteristics of legitimate traffic.

3.2. Constructing Models for Network Flow Characteristics

The  high-dimensionality,  strong  correlations,  and  extreme  imbalance  inherent  in
network  flow  data  present  the  primary  theoretical  challenge  for  drift  detection.  The
feature space dimensions of network connections or flow records are typically extremely
high, with complex nonlinear dependencies between features. More critically, the volume
of  normal traffic  differs  by  several  orders  of  magnitude  from  that of  attack traffic. This
extreme class imbalance renders drift detection methods based on global statistics highly
susceptible  to  failure.  Subtle distributional  shifts  occurring  only  in a  minority of attack
samples are drowned out by the dominant signal of normal traffic, leading to detection
delays  or  complete  false  negatives.  Consequently,  theoretical  models  must  possess  the
capability to capture the evolution of microscopic anomaly patterns within the macrocosm
of data flow, maintaining sensitivity unaffected by the scarcity of a class.

Moreover, the patterns of concept drift within network environments exhibit unique
complexity and adversarial properties, demanding detection models that transcend mere
identification of simple distribution shifts. The dynamism of cybersecurity stems not only
from  the  natural  evolution  of  technology  but  also  from  the  ongoing  strategic  interplay
between  attackers  and  defenders.  To  evade  detection,  attackers  deliberately  execute
evasive attacks, causing the traffic patterns they generate to drift slowly and purposefully
from known anomaly zones towards normal regions.

Adversarial  concept  drift  and  benign  concept  drift  arising  from  business  updates
may appear similar superficially, yet their nature is fundamentally distinct. The former
constitutes  deliberate,  targeted  evasion  by  attackers,  aimed  at  progressively  blurring
classification boundaries; the latter represents spontaneous, purposeless evolution of the
environment.  Consequently,  theoretical  models  must  not  only  detect  changes  but  also
possess  the  preliminary  capability  to  distinguish  the  'intent'  behind  them.  This
differentiation  is  crucial  for  subsequent  adaptive  decision-making:  Malicious  drift
necessitates  decisive,  reinforced  learning  to  fortify  defenses;  benign  drift  may  require
more  cautious,  incremental  adjustments to  prevent the  model  from  being disrupted  by
irrelevant noise.

To  address  these  dual  challenges,  constructing  a  robust  theoretical  model  must
adhere to core design principles of hierarchical decoupling and collaborative monitoring.
It should be deconstructed into distinct layers and groups, each equipped with sensitive
detection  submodules.  Specifically,  the  model  should  undergo  collaborative  modelling
across at least three logical layers:

First,  at  the  macro-level,  the  model  must  monitor  the  statistical  distribution  of
fundamental  network  traffic  characteristics,  such  as  the  evolution  of  aggregate  metrics
including overall traffic volume, protocol-port distribution, and connection duration. This
layer  is  sensitive  to  large-scale,  global  changes-such  as  traffic  surges  triggered  by  new
service launches or alterations in connection request patterns caused by novel scanning
tools.  The theoretical  basis  lies  in  the  fact that  even  if  attack  traffic  constitutes  a  minor
proportion, certain attacks (such as DDoS) or large-scale scans will still leave detectable
anomalous perturbations in macro-level statistics.

Second, at the micro-level, the model must delve into the internal structure of traffic,
focusing  on  the  distributional  stability  of  specific  behavioral  clusters  or  potential
subspaces.  This  requires
leveraging  online  clustering,  community  detection,  or
representation learning techniques to dynamically partition traffic into groups exhibiting
similar behavioral patterns. Drift detection then operates within each independent cluster-
for instance, monitoring the behavioral profile of a 'normal web server cluster' or tracking
the  evolutionary  characteristics  of  an  anomaly  cluster
'suspected  C&C
communications'. The core theoretical advantage of this approach lies in transforming a
global,  imbalanced  detection  problem  into  a  series  of  locally  balanced  or  at  least  more
manageable  subproblems.  This  significantly  enhances  the  model's  sensitivity  to  subtle
variations in rare attack patterns.

Thirdly,  at  the  correlation  and  sequence  level,  the  model  should  transcend  the
assumption  of  independent  and  identically  distributed  events,  focusing  instead  on  the
evolution of temporal dependencies and causal relationships between network incidents.
The essence of an attack often manifests in anomalous patterns of interconnected events
(such  as  a  successful  intrusion  potentially  encompassing  correlated  activities  across
multiple  stages:  scanning,  exploitation,  privilege  escalation,  and  data  exfiltration).
Theoretical models require integration of monitoring for time series, graph structures, or
state  transition  probabilities.  For  instance,  monitoring  changes  in  the  probability  of
behavioral sequences from specific source IPs to target service ports may detect tactical
adjustments  by  Advanced  Persistent  Threats  (APTs)  earlier  than  monitoring  isolated
connection characteristics.

Finally,  a  comprehensive  theoretical  model  necessitates  a  meta-evaluation  and
decision fusion layer. This layer receives and synthesizes output signals from detection
submodules  across  the  aforementioned  tiers  (potentially  including
'macro-metric
anomalies,'  'shifts  within  specific  anomaly  clusters,'  or  'ruptures  in  critical  correlation
patterns').  It  must  determine  whether  these  signals  indicate  a  single  fundamental
conceptual drift event based on predefined rules or learned experience, while assessing
their overall confidence level and threat severity. Through this multi-perspective, multi-
evidence fusion  and validation,  the  system can  more reliably  trigger  adaptive  learning
mechanisms  while  providing  richer  contextual  information.  For  instance:  'Current
changes primarily centre on the gradual expansion of normal operations within category
X, accompanied by minor evasion signs of known attacks within category Y.' This guides
the incremental learning module to adopt precisely matched, refined update strategies.

3.3. Theoretical Modelling of Adaptive Coordination Mechanisms

The theoretical modelling of adaptive coordination mechanisms aims to construct an
intelligent dispatch centre endowed with decision-making and regulatory capabilities. By
receiving  raw  perceptual  signals  regarding  environmental  changes  from  the  drift
detection module, it transforms these through analysis, fusion, and inference into a series
of  executable,  measurable  control  commands.  This  precisely  guides  the  incremental
learning module to execute the model update strategy most suited to the current context.
Generally, this process comprises three component steps.

The  Context  Parsing  and  Drift  Semantic  Understanding  component  processes  the
multidimensional  signals  output  by  the  drift  detection  module.  Its  theoretical  function
involves  signal  fusion  and  semantic  enhancement,  providing  an  initial  qualitative
characterization of  the drift's  nature,  which  serves as the  primary  basis  for  subsequent
decision-making.

The Strategy Mapping and Knowledge Base Management component serves as the
coordinator's  "decision-making  brain".  It  stores  mappings  between  different  drift
scenarios  and  their  corresponding  incremental  learning  strategy  combinations.  This
mapping is not static but undergoes self-optimization through a meta-learning loop: the
system  evaluates  the  long-term  effects  after  each  strategy  execution  and  adjusts  the
preference of the strategy mapping accordingly. This enables the coordination mechanism
to learn from historical decisions, continuously refining the effectiveness of its scheduling
strategies.

The  execution  control  and  feedback  loop  component  is  responsible  for  translating
decisions  into  specific  control  parameters,  issuing  them  to  the  incremental  learning
module  for  execution,  and  establishing  a  tightly  coupled  feedback  loop.  It  not  only
initiates  the  learning  process  but  also  monitors  resource  consumption  and  immediate
effects during learning, intervening dynamically when necessary. Simultaneously, it feeds
back the model's preliminary performance on new data following learning completion to
the  coordinator.  This  data  is  utilized  to  update  the  system  state  and  evaluate  the

Vol. 3 No. 1 (2026)

24

https://www.gbspress.com/index.php/JCSSR

effectiveness  of  the  current  decision,  thereby  completing  a  full  perception-decision-
execution-evaluation adaptive cycle.

The  dynamic  decision-making  process  further  necessitates  the  deep  integration  of
resource awareness with multi-objective optimization theory. In real-world deployments,
computational  power,  memory,  and  response  time  are  finite  resources.  A  theoretically
optimal  update  strategy  may  prove
impracticable  under  resource  constraints.
Consequently, the coordinator's decision model must incorporate a resource-constrained
optimizer.  For  instance,  when  multiple  drift  signals  are  detected  concurrently  amidst
resource scarcity, the coordinator must priorities resource allocation by ranking each drift
based on its threat level, confidence score, and potential impact on the system's overall
security posture. This necessitates that the coordinator not only comprehends security but
also understands the system's operational state, making real-time Pareto-optimal trade-
offs  between  objectives  such  as  detection  performance, response  velocity,  and  resource
efficiency.

The  theoretical  completeness  of  adaptive  coordination  mechanisms  is  further
demonstrated  through  their  design  for  interpretability  and  intervenability.  As  an
autonomous decision-making hub, its logic must not constitute a black box. Theoretical
models should output rational explanations for their decisions, such as: 'Strategy Y was
selected  for  rapid  model  reconstruction  due  to  detecting  high-confidence  mutations  in
feature cluster X, coupled with sufficient current system memory.' This explainability is
crucial for establishing security analysts' trust in the system, while also providing a clear
interface  for  analysts  to  intervene  manually  when  necessary  (e.g.,  vetoing  a  high-risk
update  or  injecting  domain-specific  prior  knowledge).  Through  this  hybrid  human-
machine collaborative decision-making model, the system's autonomy is combined with
human  expertise  and  overall  control  capabilities,  forming  a  more  reliable  and  robust
dynamic defense system.

4. Conclusions

This  study  systematically  constructs  a  theoretical  framework  integrating  concept
drift detection with incremental learning to address core challenges in intrusion detection
within  dynamic  network  environments.  The  research  first  elucidates  the  intrinsic
mechanism by which traditional static detection models fail due to concept drift, thereby
demonstrating  the  necessity  and  superiority  of  deeply  integrating  environmental
awareness  (drift  detection)  with  self-renewal  (incremental  learning).  By  establishing  a
closed-loop 'detection-adaptation' theoretical model, this study provides a comprehensive
paradigm for enabling autonomous, continuous evolution in dynamic intrusion detection
systems.

Incremental  learning,  whilst  designed  for  efficient  updates,  still  requires  its
computational  and  storage  overhead  to  be  strictly  constrained  in  resource-constrained
edge  devices  or  high-throughput  backbone  network  environments.  Furthermore,  after
months  or  even  years of  continuous  evolution, a  model's  internal  knowledge  structure
may become exceptionally complex, potentially giving rise to 'cognitive debt'. Designing
lightweight  algorithms  and  periodic  knowledge  distillation  and  reconstruction
mechanisms to maintain model simplicity and efficiency without sacrificing accumulated
discriminative  capabilities  presents  a  theoretical  and  practical  challenge  for  ensuring
long-term robust system operation.

Traditional  intrusion  detection  evaluations  rely  on  static  dataset  partitioning  and
fixed  performance  metrics,  which  prove  wholly  inadequate  for  assessing  dynamic
adaptive  systems.  Future  developments  necessitate  the  establishment  of  dynamic
benchmarking platforms capable of simulating concept drift, attack evolution, and shifts
in  normal  behavior. These  should  employ  metrics  that  better reflect  long-term  efficacy,
such as cumulative detection gain, average adaptation recovery time, and forgetting rate,

to  scientifically  measure  a  system's  intelligence  and  robustness  throughout  its  entire
lifecycle.

The  theoretical  significance  of  this  research  lies  in  shifting  the  focus  of  intrusion
detection  studies  from  pursuing  static  optimal  solutions  towards  constructing  viable
adaptive learning systems. It not only provides systematic theoretical tools for addressing
concept drift but, more importantly, outlines a feasible theoretical blueprint for the 'meta-
learning'  capability-the  ability  to  'learn  how  to  learn'-that  future  intelligent  security
systems  should  possess.  Future  research  may  build  upon  this  framework  to  further
explore theoretical mechanisms for handling complex drift patterns such as periodic or
context-dependent shifts, investigate theories for rapid adaptation to novel threats under
sparse sample conditions, and strive to enhance the interpretability of the entire adaptive
process. Ultimately, this will propel dynamic intrusion detection theory towards a more
mature and comprehensive stage of development.

ABSTRACT
At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent
factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to
users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a
uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number
of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes ineffi-
cient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods
have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding
sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly,
they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic bal-
ancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity,
where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for ev-
ery memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory
complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, mak-
ing the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget
strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learn-
ing based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each
each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the
search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding
Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e.,
embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet
pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-
based action formulation and engaging set representation learning,
we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an
action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level
action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on
two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular
recommender models under different memory budgets.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recommender systems (RSs) predict a user’s preference for an
item according to observed user-item interactions [51, 61] and
have been indispensable across numerous modern platforms such
as e-commerce and social media [23, 27, 64]. In contexts where
computations on local devices are essential, such as federated rec-
ommendation [39] and Internet of Things (IoT) services [16], the
need for RSs with small memory footprints becomes critical due to
highly constrained computational resources. The main bottleneck
for downsizing RSs is often the embedding table, which represents
users and items with distinct embedding vectors to facilitate pair-
wise similarity computation. As such, the size of the embedding
table can quickly exhaust the available memory, posing a significant
challenge to achieving scalable and resource-friendly RSs.

Such memory bottleneck is attributed to conventional embed-
ding tables, which typically allocate fixed and uniform embedding
sizes to each user and item [8, 18]. Such a design may require an
excessive number of parameters in industry-scale applications, e.g.,
the benchmark recommender in [11] has more than 25 billion pa-
rameters in its embedding table and requires 100 GB memory. In this
regard, researchers have developed methods to achieve lightweight
embeddings while maintaining its expressiveness. One stream of
methods aim to prune redundant parameters of the embedding table.
For example, [37] proposed OptEmbed, a novel embedding sparsifi-
cation framework that prunes redundant embeddings by learning an
importance score for each feature. These methods mostly optimize
a loss function combining a recommendation term and a sparsity
regularizer. Apart from sparsification/pruning methods, another
line of works featuring reinforcement learning (RL) techniques
have also emerged. Those methods adopt an RL-based policy net-
work to search for the optimal embedding sizes for each user/item,
where the embedding sizes (i.e., actions) can be selected from an
action space consisting of either a predefined set of values [? ]
or a continuous range [41]. Similar to sparsification methods, the
reward functions in RL-based lightweight embedding approaches

also bind the recommendation quality term with a memory com-
plexity penalty. By tuning a trade-off coefficient among the two
terms, they can adjust the regularization strength on the parameter
consumption, thus achieving the desired memory efficiency.

Despite the possibility of balancing performance and embed-
ding parameter size, these two types of methods are still away
from practical use for two reasons. Firstly, such a desired balance
is achieved by jointly optimizing an additional space complexity
constraint on top of the recommendation objective. For example,
in [18], this is formulated as the difference between the budgeted
embedding parameter size and the actual parameter consumption
of the compressed embedding table. However, such an implicit loss
term means that the resultant embedding table may not necessarily
meet the desired parameter budget every time [8]. Moreover, the
optimization quality is highly sensitive to the trade-off coefficient,
which needs to be heuristically tuned for each memory budget.

The second reason is that, to achieve optimal recommendation
performance under each memory budget, the embedding size is
decided on an instance-by-instance basis w.r.t. each user/item. Tak-
ing a recent RL-based method CIESS [41] as an example, a policy
network predicts the optimal action for every single user and item,
based on which the backbone RS is trained and evaluated to cal-
culate the reward, enabling training the policy network. On the
one hand, ideally, the policy network is expected to be iteratively
updated w.r.t. each instance (i.e., user/item), but this can be prohib-
itively inefficient given the large number of users and items. On
the other hand, performing only one update per batch/epoch leads
to slower convergence due to the aggregated nature of the reward
function, and may potentially result in inferior generalization [20].
In response to both challenges, we propose Budgeted Embedding
Table (BET) for RSs, an automated input embedding size search
paradigm that can efficiently generate size decisions and perform
optimization at the embedding table level. An overview of BET is
provided in Figure 1. To address the first challenge, we innovatively
propose a bounded sampler that draws embedding sizes for all
users/items from a collection of probabilistic distributions, with the
guarantee that the total parameter usage is capped. As the embed-
ding sizes for all instances in the embedding table are produced all
at once, we term this a table-level action. This strategy frees us from
the need for manually designing and tuning the implicit parameter
constraint in the reward/loss function, and allows us to enforce the
memory budget with a negligible cost.

To tackle the second challenge, we further pair the generated
table-level actions with a fitness prediction network to evaluate the
quality of those actions. Essentially, in each search iteration, after
sampling several table-level actions, we need to identify the ones
that promise high recommendation accuracy. A straightforward
solution is to greedily evaluate each candidate action by training
and evaluating a backbone RS from scratch with the suggested
embedding sizes [18, 41, 62? ], which apparently impedes efficiency.
One may think of a surrogate function [3, 8] that “predicts” the
fitness of each action, instead of explicitly evaluating it. Accurately
predicting the performance of the table-level actions is crucial yet
another major challenge in this regard, as either overestimating or
underestimating an action’s performance will eventually cause sub-
optimal embedding size decisions. To align with the evaluation of
table-level actions in BET, our fitness predictor innovatively utilizes

Figure 1: Overview of BET.

a set-based formulation of actions, and embeds each action with
DeepSets [59], where the learned high-quality action embeddings
can efficiently provide reliable performance feedback on each table-
level action. Furthermore, the set-based action representations can
be inductively learned, which is essential for our iterative search
algorithm that constantly generates unseen actions that need to be
evaluated.

To summarize, our work presents the contributions below:

• We identify the practicality bottlenecks of existing embed-
ding size search methods for lightweight RSs, namely the
implicit and non-scalable parameter size constraints for meet-
ing different memory budgets, and the inefficient embedding
size generation and evaluation for every instance.

• We propose BET, a novel table-level embedding size search
approach featuring an efficient action sampling strategy that
generates table-level actions for all users and items and a
DeepSets-based fitness prediction network that accurately
predicts their performance to reduce action evaluation costs.
• Extensive empirical comparisons have been carried out on
two real-world datasets by pairing state-of-the-art embed-
ding size search algorithms with various backbone RSs, which
confirm the advantageous efficacy of BET.

2 PRELIMINARIES
To provide a detailed research background, we hereby discuss rele-
vant research topics.

2.1 Deep Recommender Systems
Researchers have proposed numerous deep recommender mod-
els to capture the user-item relationships. The first line of deep
recommender systems are based on MLPs. For instance, Neural
Collaborative Filtering (NCF) [15] integrates a MLP with a matrix
factorization component to learn the two-way interactions between
users and items. AutoRec [45] uses an autoencoder to model the
user-item interactions in a low-dimensional hidden space and per-
form collaborative filtering. Lin et al. proposed a novel sequential
recommender system, Dual Contrastive Network [31] that gen-
erates self-supervised signals by considering both user and item
perspectives and refining representation learning through dual rep-
resentation contrastive learning. In addition to MLP-based meth-
ods, graph-based architectures [14, 53, 58] have also been studied.
For example, Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) [53]
extends traditional neural collaborative filtering by modeling user-
item interactions with graph convolution networks. LightGCN [14]

558Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems

takes inspiration from NGCF and simplifies it by removing its self-
connection, feature transformation and linear activation operations.
Another line of recommender systems are based on factorization
machines. Factorization Machines (FM) combine linear regression
with matrix factorization techniques to handle high-order interac-
tions [42]. [2] was also created to mine higher-order interactions.
Its deep variants - QNFM [7], DeepFM [13] and xLightFM [17]
have been proposed too. Moreover, numerous methods have been
proposed to leverage heterogeneous data for recommendation. For
instance, [6, 12, 25] have been devised to extract information from
user reviews or hashtags. [24, 52] have been proposed to exploit
videos and images for recommendation. Location information has
also been utilized to assist location-aware recommendations [4].

2.2 Lightweight Embeddings For

Recommenders

Various classes of works have investigated learning compressed
embeddings to provide a low-memory alternative to traditional
embedding tables in recommender systems [63]. For examples,
feature selection search methods [32, 36, 54] are trained to learn
importance scores, based on which they filter out the unimportant
feature fields. Embedding dimension search approaches [22, 34, 35,
40, 41, 62] improve traditional recommender systems with fixed and
uniform sizes by introducing mixed dimensions for each feature.
Quantization-based methods [5, 9, 10, 19, 21, 26] reduces the preci-
sion of numerical values and store the parameters with lower bits.
Feature hashing approaches [1, 11, 28, 30, 33, 46, 47, 57, 60] utilize
various hash tricks to transform input values to a smaller range,
thus compression the embedding table. Knowledge distillation tech-
niques train a smaller student model from a larger teacher model
and have been used to learn an embedding table of smaller sizes
from larger ones [55, 56]. BET achieves dynamic embedding sizes
and aims to find the optimal embedding size for each feature, so it
should be classified as a embedding dimension search approach.

3 PROPOSED APPROACH
In a nutshell, BET has three components: (1) a pre-trained backbone
recommender with a full-size embedding table 𝐺Θ (·) parameterized
by Θ; (2) an action fitness prediction network 𝐹Φ (·) parameterized
by Φ; and (3) a non-parametric action sampler 𝐻 (·). Figure 1 pro-
vides an overview of the workflow of BET. Under pre-specified
memory budgets, 𝐻 (·) samples actions from a set of probabilistic
distributions in each iteration. Each action specifies the embedding
sizes for all users and items. Afterwards, 𝐹Φ (·) estimates the fitness
of each action and selects the best action predicted. 𝐺Θ (·) is further
finetuned by adopting the embedding sizes in the chosen action,
and is then is evaluated on a hold-out dataset to obtain the actual
fitness score (i.e., recommendation quality) of the action. This facil-
itates the optimization of 𝐹Φ (·) by minimizing its prediction error,
thus leading us to optimal actions under each given memory budget
after 𝑇 iterations. In the remainder of this section, we unfold the
design of each component.

3.1 Recommender with Embedding Masking
Let U and V denote a set of users 𝑢 and items 𝑣, respectively. The
embedding table in the recommender maps each integer-valued user

or item IDs to a real-valued embedding vector e𝑛, where 𝑛 ∈ U ∪V
indexes either a user or an item. Note that we only separately use 𝑢
and 𝑣 to index users and items when they need to be distinguished,
e.g., when performing pairwise ranking. The vertical concatena-
tion of all embedding vectors forms the embedding table E of size
(|U| + |V |) × 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 , where 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum/full embedding
size supported by 𝐺Θ (·). The embedding sizes are adjusted via a bi-
nary mask M ∈ {0, 1} ( | U |+| V | ) ×𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 , which is commonly adopted
for embedding sparsification in lightweight recommender systems
[35, 37, 41]. Each row m𝑛 in M is a mask vector corresponding to
user/item 𝑛. Given a searched embedding size 𝑑𝑛, we set the first
𝑑𝑛 elements of m𝑛 to ones the remaining 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑑𝑛 dimensions to
zeros. Then, we perform element-wise multiplication of the embed-
ding table E and the binary mask matrix M to adjust the embedding
sizes during embedding look-up, i.e., e𝑛 = (E ⊙ M) [𝑛] where [𝑛]
retrieves the 𝑛-th row of a matrix. M is adaptively updated based
on the sampled actions in every iteration. It is worth noting that,
in the deployment stage, only the heavily sparsified embedding
table E𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 = E ⊙ M will be stored, where the cost of storing
zero-valued entries can be negligible with sparse matrix storage
techniques [44, 49]. Once we obtain the sparse embedding vectors,
the recommender model 𝐺Φ (·) computes a preference score ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣
representing pairwise user-item similarity:

ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣 = 𝐺Θ (e𝑢, e𝑣),

(1)
where 𝐺Θ (·) can be any latent factor-based recommender model
that supports pairwise scoring.

𝑢 ∈ U, 𝑣 ∈ V,

For optimizing the recommender, we adopt Bayesian Personal-

ized Ranking (BPR) loss [43]:

L𝐵𝑃𝑅 =

∑︁

(𝑢,𝑣,𝑣′ ) ∈ D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛

− ln 𝜎 ( ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣 − ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣′ ) + 𝜂 ∥Θ∥2

,

(2)

where (𝑢, 𝑣, 𝑣 ′) ∈ D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 represents the training samples where
user 𝑢 chooses item 𝑣 over item 𝑣 ′, while ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣 and ˆ𝑦𝑢𝑣′ respectively
represent the predicted preferences that user 𝑢 has on items 𝑣 and
𝑣 ′. 𝜂 ∥Θ∥2
2 provides regularization to prevent overfitting, with a
scaling factor 𝜂. Our goal is to search for the optimal embedding
sizes for all users and items under strict memory budgets, hence
the overall objective is defined as follows:

min
Θ,Φ

L𝐵𝑃𝑅 s.t. 1 −

∥M∥1,1
(|U| + |V |) × 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥

≤ 𝑐,

(3)

where ∥M∥1,1 counts the number of ones, or equivalently retained
parameters in the binary mask, 𝑐 (0 < 𝑐 < 1) is the target sparsity
rate, i.e., the ratio between the numbers of active parameters in
sparsified and full embedding tables.

3.2 Budget-Aware Action Sampling
Hereby we introduce a novel table-level action sampling strategy. In
each search iteration, we randomly sample a set of candidate actions
Q = {𝑎1, ..., 𝑎𝑚 }. Each action assigns a continuous embedding size
𝑑𝑛 ∈ N+

to every user or item 𝑛 ∈ U ∪ V.

≤𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥

As we aim to avoid optimizing the selected action towards an
implicit, manually tuned memory cost term, we propose to directly
draw a table-level action that: (1) makes all generated embedding
sizes conditioned on a certain distribution; and (2) ensures the
total parameter size of all embeddings is capped at the budgeted

559WSDM ’24, March 4–8, 2024, Merida, Mexico

Yunke Qu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, & Hongzhi Yin

parameter consumption. In short, (1) essentially narrows the action
space to mitigate the difficulty of searching from a huge collection
of completely random actions, while (2) guarantees that the table-
level action strictly meets the memory budget in the first place.

To generate an action 𝑎, we first determine two probability distri-
butions 𝑃U and 𝑃V respectively for users and items. Meanwhile, to
introduce inductive bias to the action sampler, instead of resorting
to a fixed distribution throughout the search process, 𝑃U and 𝑃V
are both randomly chosen from a set of candidate distributions
with on-the-fly parameterization. Specifically, we utilize a power
law distribution, a truncated exponential distribution, a truncated
normal distribution and a log normal distribution. For simplicity,
we let the two selected distributions respectively be parameterized
by 𝛽 U and 𝛽 V . In each iteration, the parameters are all determined
uniformly at random:

𝛽 U, 𝛽 V ∼ Uniform(0, 𝛽𝑚𝑎𝑥 ),
where 𝛽𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximal value allowed. Notably, the embedding
sizes of each field (i.e., users and items) are derived by independently
sampling from two distributions 𝑃U and 𝑃V . This is because each
field may have distinct properties [37] and different distributions
are needed to model the embedding sizes of users and items.

(4)

After the distributions are determined, we sample |U| and |V |
probabilities respectively from 𝑃U and 𝑃V . The set of probabilities
are respectively denoted as {𝑝𝑖 } | U |
∼ 𝑃V . We
𝑖=1
then normalize all 𝑝𝑖 and 𝑝 𝑗 as the following:
𝑝 𝑗
(cid:205)| V |
𝑗

∼ 𝑃U and {𝑝 𝑗 } | V |
𝑗=1

𝑝𝑖
(cid:205)| U |
𝑖

˜𝑝 𝑗 =

˜𝑝𝑖 =

𝑝 𝑗

𝑝𝑖

(5)

,

,

where ˜𝑝𝑖 / ˜𝑝 𝑗 indicates the fraction of parameters each user/item re-
ceives among all users/items. Next, we obtain the actual embedding
sizes by applying the fraction on the memory budget:
𝑑𝑖 = ⌊ ˜𝑝𝑖 · 𝑤 · 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 · (|U| + |V |)⌋,
𝑑 𝑗 = ⌊ ˜𝑝 𝑗 · (1 − 𝑤) · 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 · (|U| + |V |)⌋,

𝑖 = 1, 2, · · · , |U|,
𝑗 = 1, 2, · · · , |V |,

(6)

where 𝑤 controls the proportion of parameters allocated to the
users. In practice, 𝑤 can be empirically defined, such as an even
split (i.e., 0.5). In BET, 𝑤 is sampled from a uniform distribution
each time a table-level action is generated, i.e., 𝑤 ∼ Uniform(0, 1),
so as to probe more embedding size allocation strategies in the
iterative search process.

With |U| + |V | embedding sizes derived, we now allocate them
to each user and item. Previous studies [37, 48, 62] have shown that
more frequent users and items tend to be more informative than
long-tail ones, hence generally benefit from a larger embedding
dimension which allows more information to be encoded. Therefore,
we rank the users by their frequency and allocate the 𝑛-th largest
user embedding size to the 𝑛-th frequent user. Similarly, we assign
embedding sizes to items based on their frequency. As such, we are
capable of sampling 𝑚 random table-level actions in each search
iteration to facilitate the subsequent steps.

3.3 Fitness Prediction Network
In each iteration 𝑡 we sample a set of 𝑚 actions, denoted as Q𝑡 . To
select the optimal action from Q𝑡 , a straightforward approach is to
pair each sampled action with a fresh recommender, train it until

Figure 2: Example of our set-based action formulation. Sup-
pose we have three legitimate embedding sizes {16, 32, 64},
four users (red) and two items (green). Then, size 16 is a
set containing user 1, user 2 and item 4, which means their
embedding sizes are 16. Similarly, the action specifies the
embedding sizes of user 3 and item 5 to be 32. Size 64 is not
used by any users/items.

Figure 3: Overview of the DeepSets-based fitness predictor.

convergence and select the action that yields the best final recom-
mendation quality on the validation set. However, this approach
faces inevitable computational burdens given the 𝑚 training and
evaluation processes needed per search iteration.

In BET, we utilize an action fitness predictor, which inductively
learns distinct embeddings of actions and predicts its fitness score
(i.e., recommendation quality) based on the action embeddings. As
discussed earlier, learning expressive representations of different
actions is a crucial yet non-trivial task for effective fitness predic-
tion, especially considering the need for inductively composing
embeddings for unseen actions in every new search iteration.

Thus, we propose a novel action fitness prediction network based
on the notion of set representation learning [50, 59]. Before delving
into the fitness prediction network, we first detail the set-based
formulation of each action. Each action is regarded as a collection
𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥
of sets 𝑎 = {S𝑑 }
𝑑=1 , where each set S𝑑 = {𝑛|∀𝑛 ∈ U ∪V, 𝑑𝑛 = 𝑑 }
stores the users and items that use the embedding size 𝑑 ∈ [1, 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 ].
S𝑑 = ∅ if there is no user or item assigned to embedding size 𝑑.
A toy example with is given in figure 2. As such, this allows us to
build our fitness predictor upon DeepSets [59] owing to its ability
to learn permutation-variant representations of sets.

The fitness prediction network consists of four components: a
user encoder 𝜌 U (·), an item encoder 𝜌 V (·), an embedding size
encoder 𝜇 (·), and a decoder 𝜋 (·), all of which bear a distinct MLP.
Encoders 𝜌 U (·)/𝜌 V (·) take some contextual information about a

560Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems

user/item, and produce their corresponding representations. Previ-
ous studies [41, 62] have demonstrated the suitability of users’/items’
popularity and current embedding sizes as the context information
for embedding size search. We inherit this design by establishing a
hierarchical, set-compatible action representation learning scheme.
Specifically, 𝜌 U (·) and 𝜌 V (·) respectively takes the user and item
frequencies to generate frequency-weighted embeddings:

), 𝑢 ∈ U,

𝒒𝑢 = 𝜌 U (

𝑓𝑢
max𝑢′ ∈ U 𝑓𝑢′
𝑓𝑣
max𝑣′ ∈ V 𝑓𝑣′
where each 𝑓𝑢 /𝑓𝑣 is normalized by the maximum user/item fre-
quency observed.

𝒒𝑣 = 𝜌 V (

𝑣 ∈ V,

(7)

),

As mentioned above, within an action 𝑎, each set S𝑑 contains
all users and items with embedding size 𝑑. To obtain embedding 𝒔𝑑
of set S𝑑 , we firstly fuse the representations of all involved users
and items using mean aggregation, and then append the explicit
embedding size information:

𝒔𝑑 = 𝜇

where [; ] represents concatenation. With the representations gen-
erated for all 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 sets, we derive the embedding for the entire
action 𝑎 by further merging all set representations:

𝒉𝑎 =

𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥
∑︁

𝑑=1

(9)

where we use 𝒉𝑎 to denote an action embedding. An additional
benefit from the set-based action embeddings is that, whenever the
action sampler draws any action that is new to the fitness predictor
(which is commonly the case in embedding size search), it allows
for generating the action embedding in an inductive fashion with
the available context information and the updated set formulation.
With each action embedding 𝒉𝑎, the decoder 𝜋 (·) takes 𝒉𝑎 and

outputs ˆ𝑟𝑎, which is the predicted fitness score of action 𝑎:

where eval(·) evaluates the recommendation quality, D𝑣𝑎𝑙 is the
validation set, M𝑎 is the binary mask corresponding to action 𝑎,
and the denominator is the recommendation quality of the pre-
trained backbone recommender 𝐺Θ (·) with the full embedding
table. Hence, 𝑟𝑎 can be interpreted as the ratio between the two
recommendation accuracy obtained by the sparsified embeddings
and the full embeddings. The implementation of eval(·) can follow
most commonly used recommendation metrics like Recall@𝑘 and
NDCG@𝑘 [14, 43], where we adopt an ensemble of both metrics
under different values of 𝑘:

(10)

where we the choices of 𝑘 cover K = {5, 10, 20} in our paper.

We will detail how the entire fitness prediction network 𝐹Φ (·) is
optimized along with the search process in the next section.

3.4 Fitness Predictor Training
Though bearing a relatively simple structure, the fitness predictor
still needs to be trained with some ground truth samples. The
fitness prediction network 𝐹Φ (·) is optimized by minimizing the
mean squared error between the predicted fitness score ˆ𝑟𝑎 and the
actual one 𝑟𝑎 with gradient descent:
∑︁

∑︁

(𝑟𝑎 − 𝐹Φ′ (𝑎))2 = argmin

(𝑟𝑎 − ˆ𝑟𝑎)2.

Φ = argmin

The actual fitness score 𝑟𝑎, i.e., recommendation quality of the
action, can be evaluated on the backbone recommender 𝐺Θ (·) after
being finetuned with an action 𝑎 w.r.t. Eq. 2:

𝑟𝑎 =

eval(E ⊙ M𝑎 |D𝑣𝑎𝑙 )
eval(E|D𝑣𝑎𝑙 )

,

(12)

The ground truth samples can be thus generated by gathering
different action-fitness pairs. Instead of constructing a pool of such
training samples and train 𝐹Φ (·) upfront, we incrementally add one
training sample in every search iteration 𝑡 to optimize 𝐹Φ (·) on
the go. The training sample is constructed by firstly identifying
a promising action from Q𝑡 , denoted by 𝑎𝑡 , and then obtaining
𝑟𝑎𝑡 by evaluating 𝑎𝑡 on the finetuned 𝐺Θ (·). Compared with most
RL-based embedding size search methods, the required number of
fitness evaluation with the recommendation model will be reduced
from 𝑚 × 𝑇 to merely 𝑇 , where 𝑇 is the total number of iterations
as well as the ground truth samples for optimizing 𝐹Φ (·).

3.5 Action Selection and Embedding Retraining
The pseudocode for BET is presented in Algorithm 1. Among its 𝑇
search iterations, we utilize three different strategies to pick one
action 𝑎𝑡 from the candidate action set Q𝑡 (lines 4-12). Then, the
recommender 𝐺Θ (·) is finetuned by adopting 𝑎𝑡 and evaluated on
the validation set (lines 13-14), where the produced (𝑎𝑡 , 𝑟𝑎𝑡 ) sample

is popped into the population set A to facilitate training the fitness
prediction network 𝐹Φ (·) (lines 16-20). Finally, a selective retraining
process is conducted with the top-ranked actions in the population
in order to identify the best embedding size decision for all users and
items. We provide further details about action selection strategies
and retraining the sparsified embeddings below.

3.5.1 Diversifying the Action Space. The iterative input embedding
size search contains 𝑇 iterations. In each iteration 𝑡, the selected
action 𝑎𝑡 is added to the population set A with its associated fitness
score. For efficiency consideration, in each iteration 𝑡, we only
compute the actual fitness score for action 𝑎𝑡 , which is selected
from candidate actions Q𝑡 with one of the three following strategies:
I: We use our fitness prediction network 𝐹Φ (·) to predict the
fitness score of each candidate actions, and greedily selects
the action predicted to have the highest fitness score, i.e., 𝑎𝑡 =
𝐹Φ (𝑎). In essence, 𝐹Φ (·) is a surrogate function
argmax𝑎∈ Q𝑡
that is trained to approximate Eq. 12 and is substantially more
cost-effective than evaluating all 𝑚 actions via recommender
finetuning.

II: We randomly select one action from the Q𝑡 to diversify the
training samples for 𝐹Φ (·) by preventing it from overfitting
some specific action distributions in the population A.
III: We identify currently the best action (with the highest 𝑟𝑎)
in A. All actions in Q𝑡 and the best action are inductively
embedded into vector representations using Eq. 9. Then, by
calculating the pairwise Euclidean distance, we select action
𝑎𝑡 ∈ Q𝑡 by locating the best action’s nearest neighbor in the
embedding space.

Selective Retraining for Sparsified Embeddings. After 𝑇 search
3.5.2
iterations, from the population we identify the top five actions with
the highest 𝑟𝑎 on the validation set, denoted as A′. Each action
𝑎 ∈ A′ is paired with a fresh backbone recommender model, which
is trained from scratch on the training set until convergence. Next,
we evaluate the trained recommenders and select the final action
𝑎∗ that yields the best validation performance:

𝑎∗ = argmax
𝑎∈ A′
with which the sparsified embedding E𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 is obtained and stored
for inference.

4 EXPERIMENTS
This section details the experimental results of BET’s performance.

4.1 Base Recommenders and Comparative

Methods

One can combine BET with different embedding-based representa-
tion learning backbone recommender models. We tested the effec-
tiveness of our approach with three commonly used recommender
models as the backbone recommender 𝐹Φ: NCF [15], NGCF [53]
and LightGCN [14]. We used the same settings as reported in their
original works and replaced the embedding table with one with
adjustable embedding sizes to demonstrate the versatility and gen-
eralizability of our method across various backbone recommenders.
We compare BET with the following model-agnostic embedding
size search algorithms:

• PEP [35]: It adaptively prunes the embedding parameters
based on a learned pruning threshold learned along with the
model’s other parameters during the training process.

• ESAPN [? ]: It uses an RL agent which performs hard selec-
tion on embedding sizes for users and items based on the
memory complexity and recommendation performance.
• OptEmbed [37]: It prunes redundant embeddings based on
learnable pruning thresholds indicative of features’ impor-
tance and derives the optimal embedding size for each field
using evolutionary search.

• CIESS [41]: It is an RL-based method that chooses embedding
sizes for the users and items from a continuous domain.
• Single and Uniform (SU): All users and items share equal

and fixed embedding sizes.

• Single and Random (SR): The embedding sizes of the users

and items are sampled from a uniform distribution.

4.2 Evaluation Protocols
All the aforementioned methods are evaluated on two real-world
datasets: Gowalla [29] and Yelp2018 [53]. The first has 1,027,370
interactions between 29,858 users and 40,981 items while the latter
has 1,561,147 interactions between 31,668 users and 38,048 items.
We take 50%, 25% and 25% of the two datasets for training, vali-
dation, and test. To measure the recommendation performance of
the backbone recommender, Recall@𝑘 and NDCG@𝑘 are used as
evaluation metrics, where 𝑘 is set to either 5 or 20. To test the recom-
mendation performance of CIESS, PEP, SU and SR, three different
sparsity ratios (𝑐) of 80%, 90% and 95% are used. For each method,
the compressed embedding table is ensured to have no more than
𝑐 · 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 · (|U| + |V |) usable parameter and the maximal embed-
ding size is 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 128. However, since ESAPN and OptEmbed are
not designed to precisely control the embedding sparsity and focus
more on the performance, this section only reports the performance
associated with their final embedding tables after pruning.

4.3 Implementation Notes for BET
Hereby we detail the implementation of BET. The number of search
iterations 𝑇 is 10. The maximal values of the distribution parameters
𝛽𝑚𝑎𝑥 are set to 20 for power law distribution, 20 for truncated
normal distribution, 5 for truncated exponential distribution and
0.5 for log normal distribution. The maximal embedding size 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥
is 128 and the minimal embedding size 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛 is 1. In each iteration,
the pre-trained backbone recommender is finetuned for 10 epochs
(i.e., ℎ = 10) when the backbone recommender is LightGCN or NCF.
When NGCF is used, the backbone recommender is finetuned for
15 epochs (i.e., ℎ = 15). For finetuning, the initial learning rate is
0.03 and decays every 200 steps with a decay ratio of 0.98. The
number of fitness prediction updates in each iteration, or 𝑁 , is set
to 2. The user and item encoders have input size 1, output size 16,
and hidden size 16. The size encoder has input size 17, output size
64, and hidden size 64. The decoder has input size 64, output size 1,
and hidden size 64. All the MLP-based encoders and decoders have
two layers with the Leaky RelU [38] activation function.

Table 2: Performance of BET when different selection meth-
ods are used.
4.4 Overall Performance Comparison
Table 1 shows the Recall@𝑘 and NDCG@𝑘 scores of various light-
weight embedding methods when they are paired with different
backbone recommender models. We also perform paired student’s
𝑡-test between BET and the best baseline method. Compared with
the baselines with adjustable sparsity ratios (i.e., PEP, SU, SR, and
CIESS), BET achieves better performance across all three backbone

recommenders and at nearly all specified sparsity levels (80%, 90%,
and 95%). The associated 𝑝-values are below 5% most of the time
so we can reject the null hypothesis that the observed performance
changes occurred by chance in most scenarios.

Meanwhile, the sparsity ratios achieved by ESAPN and OptEm-
bed range from 67% and 83%, often failing to meet the minimum
target of 80%. Despite keeping a relatively higher number of param-
eters compared to other methods, their recommendation perfor-
mance is consistently inferior to BET. For instance, when used with
LightGCN on the Gowalla dataset, ESAPN requires more memory
complexity (75% sparsity ratio) to achieve a comparable perfor-
mance compared to BET under an 90% sparsity condition.

In summary, BET demonstrates superior performance while
maintaining the same memory usage. Similarly, when comparing
performance levels, BET proves to be more efficient in memory
utilization. Consequently, these findings highlight the benefits of
the ongoing embedding size exploration in BET.

NDCG@20 with LightGCN as the backbone recommender.

4.5 Model Component Analysis
Selecting from the set of candidate actions in each iteration is a vital
step in BET, where we proposed a hybrid selection method that
alternately uses three selection strategies. To study the effectiveness
of the proposed selection method and the DeepSets-based fitness
prediction network, we conduct a quantitative study on BET and
its two variants. The first variant uses random selection only. The
second variant incorporates a simplistic fitness prediction network
that only accepts the embedding sizes of each user and item. Table
2 illustrates the performance of the original version of BET along
with its two variants in terms of their Recall@20 and NDCG@20
scores. Only the performance of the best-performing backbone
recommender LightGCN is reported due to space limit. The results
show that BET with a DeepSets-based fitness prediction network
has better performance than the two variants, implying that our
proposed selection method is effective and the DeepSets-based
architecture is able to learn the latent representation of actions.

4.6 Analysis of Hyperparameter
In this section, we inspect the influence of the core hyperparameters
in BET in terms of Recall@20 and NDCG@20. LightGCN shows
the best performance so it is chosen as the backbone recommender
for demonstration.

4.6.1 Number of Sampled Actions 𝑚. In each iteration, we sam-
ple 𝑚 candidate actions to choose from. We tune BET with 𝑚 ∈
{20, 40, 60, 80, 100} for both Yelp2018 and Gowalla. Then we show
how the performance changes with different values of 𝑚 w.r.t. Re-
call@20 and NDCG@20 scores. As shown in Figure 4, although
BET is relatively insensitive to the value of 𝑚, better performance
is achieved with 𝑚 = 100 on both datasets.

4.6.2 Number of Iterations 𝑇 . BET iteratively samples, selects and
evaluates actions in search of the optimal one. One natural question
that arises is how many iterations it needs to find the action that
leads to peak recommendation performance. This question is crucial
for understanding the effectiveness of BET. Therefore, we perform
selective retraining as described in Section 3.5.2 on the resulting

NDCG@20 with LightGCN as the backbone recommender.

population A𝑡 for each training iteration 𝑡 ∈ [0,𝑇 ] and report
the best recommendation performance in terms of Recall@20 and
NDCG@20. We also report the average fitness prediction loss in
each iteration. Figure 6 shows that fitness predictor converges
within the first 15 iterations. While the training loss of the fitness
predictor is diminishing, BET witnesses a substantial improvement
in its performance in the first 10-15 iterations, as shown in Figure 5.
Then performance continues to climb slowly after the 15th iteration
until it reaches its peak around the 40th iteration and remains
unchanged after that. In conclusion, setting 𝑇 = 50 should suffice
for BET to find the optimal action for all sparsity ratios.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Latent factor recommenders typically employ vectorized embed-
dings with a uniform and fixed size, resulting in suboptimal perfor-
mance and excessive memory complexity. To address this challenge,
we have introduced BET, a model-agnostic algorithm to enable the
selection of customized embedding sizes at the level of the em-
bedding table for each user/item. This approach enhances the the
embeddings while minimizing memory costs. Next, we will develop
embedding size search algorithms for streaming recommendation.

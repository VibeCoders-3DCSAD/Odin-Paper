Abstract
Budgeting  and  financial  planning  &  analysis  (FP&A)  increasingly  require  combining  macroeconomic
signals,  channel-level  marketing  effectiveness,  and  hard  accounting  constraints  into  a  single,  auditable
decision process. This paper proposes and empirically evaluates an end-to-end framework that (i) forecasts
category-level demand from public macro data, (ii) learns diminishing-returns marketing response curves,
and (iii) solves a constrained portfolio optimization problem to allocate marketing spend while satisfying
SG&A and cash-flow guardrails consistent with real public-company statements. Using quarterly Personal
Consumption  Expenditures  (PCE)  components  from  FRED  (durable  goods,  nondurable  goods,  and
services) as a proxy for market demand, we compare seasonal naïve, SARIMAX, gradient boosting, and a
multivariate  VAR  model  in  a  rolling  backtest  (2018Q1-2025Q3).  In  parallel,  we  estimate  marketing
response  from  the  Advertising  dataset  (TV,  radio,  and  newspaper  spend)  via  linear  models,  gradient
boosting,  and  a  Hill-function  saturation  model.  We  then  calibrate  financial  constraints-gross  margin,
SG&A ratio, and operating cash-flow coverage-directly from Apple Inc.’s FY2025 Form 10-K filed with
the SEC, and integrate all components into a Monte Carlo-evaluated budgeting optimizer. Results show
that  multivariate  models  improve  total-demand  accuracy  (≈2.85%  MAPE)  and  that  nonlinear  response
curves  indicate  strong  diminishing  returns  and  negligible  incremental  value  for  newspaper  spend.  The
constrained optimizer produces stable allocations that trade off expected operating profit and downside
risk, and it highlights a practical insight: budgets that exactly meet a ratio-based cap under point forecasts
may violate constraints under realistic demand uncertainty. The proposed workflow is fully reproducible
from public data sources and provides a template for transparent, constraint-aware budgeting.

INTRODUCTION

Budgeting  is  one  of  the  most  repeated  and  most  consequential  management  processes  inside

organizations. A budget is simultaneously a forecast (what is likely to happen), a commitment

device  (what  the  organization  will  fund),  and  a  control  system  (how  performance  will  be

evaluated). In modern FP&A, the process is further complicated by rapid changes in consumer

behavior, channel fragmentation, and the expectation that financial plans can be refreshed quickly

as conditions change. Organizations, therefore, need tools that can be updated frequently, explain

their logic clearly, and connect directly to accounting outcomes (Jamabudin Ghofur & Riyanto,

2025).  While  FP&A  budgeting  is  used  here  as  a  case  study,  the  paper’s  contribution  is

methodological: an auditable end-to-end pipeline that integrates demand forecasting, marketing

response modeling, and constraint-aware optimization under uncertainty (Adowusu-Mensah et

al., 2024).

A  common  practical  tension  is  that  budget  inputs  come  from  heterogeneous  sources  and  at

different  temporal  resolutions.  Macroeconomic  indicators  and  market  demand  signals  may  be

published monthly or quarterly; internal sales data may be published daily; and some key financial

constraints  (e.g.,  SG&A-to-revenue  targets)  are  reviewed  on  a  quarterly  and  annual  basis.  A

coherent  pipeline  must  combine  these  signals  without  losing  interpretability.  For  example,  a

business may decide to cut discretionary spending when demand softens. However, it must also

ensure that the cut does not damage growth and still satisfy fixed commitments such as R&D and

payroll.

Marketing spend is especially challenging to budget because its benefits are uncertain, nonlinear,

and  often  delayed.  Empirically,  most  channels  exhibit  diminishing  marginal  returns:  the  first

dollars  spent  are  usually  the  most  effective,  while  later  dollars  mostly  buy  redundant  reach.

Additionally, channels can substitute for each other (e.g., radio and TV) or work synergistically.

This  means  that  linear  response  models,  while  easy  to  communicate,  can  produce  unrealistic

implied returns at high budgets.

Accounting constraints further constrain feasible budget actions. Even if a marketing investment

has  a  positive  expected  return,  it  might  be  unacceptable  if  it  causes  SG&A  ratios  to  exceed

guidance, if it reduces operating cash flow below a threshold required for debt covenants, or if it

pushes operating margin below a target. These constraints are not hypothetical: public-company

filings explicitly report the components of profitability and cash flow, and internal governance

often sets ratio targets that mirror those external statements (Apple Inc., 2025).

The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  propose  a  lightweight  yet  end-to-end  framework  that  can  be

instantiated using fully public datasets and to demonstrate how forecasting, response modeling,

and  constraint-aware  optimization  can  be  integrated  into  a  single  budgeting  workflow.  Our

emphasis is not on producing the best possible forecast in isolation, but rather on producing a

decision  recommendation  that  is  defensible  under  uncertainty  and  aligned  with  accounting

realities.

A useful mental model is to treat budgeting as a pipeline that turns information into commitments.

The  input  information  includes  macro  and  market  signals,  internal  run-rate  data,  strategic

priorities,  and  constraints.  The  commitments  are  resource  allocations  and  targets.  The  key

challenge is that the same pipeline must be both analytically sound and organizationally legible:

the plan must be explainable to executives and must be implementable by operating teams.

We  use  this  paper’s  public-data  instantiation  as  a  pedagogical  reference  implementation.  It  is

intentionally conservative: it uses simple but robust model classes, emphasizes backtesting and

uncertainty estimation, and calibrates constraints to audited public statements. The trade-off is

that  some  domain-specific  nuance  (e.g.,  product-level  mix,  marketing  carryover)  is  abstracted

away. The benefit is a clear template for linking data, models, and constraints in an auditable way.

Figure  1  summarizes  the  proposed  end-to-end  architecture.  The  demand  module  produces

category-level  forecasts  and  an  empirical  uncertainty  distribution.  The  marketing  module

estimates a response function with diminishing returns. The constraint module converts audited

financial statement ratios into feasibility constraints. Finally, the optimizer searches over channel

allocations to maximize an explicit profit objective while respecting constraints and controlling

risk.

We structure our contributions in terms that map to practical FP&A deliverables:

1.  Forecasting deliverable: a rolling backtest comparison that yields an explicit accuracy-

complexity trade-off for macro demand proxies.

2.  Marketing deliverable: marginal ROI curves by channel that identify saturation points

and low-value channels.

3.  Finance  deliverable:  a  budget  recommendation  expressed  in  the  same  ratios  used  in

accounting reviews (gross margin, SG&A ratio, operating cash-flow coverage).

4.  Governance deliverable: Monte Carlo constraint satisfaction rates that quantify how often

a plan could violate ratio caps under demand uncertainty.

We also summarize the methodological components as:

1.  Forecasting systems: rolling-origin macro demand forecasting and empirical uncertainty

estimation.

2.  Data-driven  modeling/analytics:  channel-level  response  modeling  with  diminishing

returns and marginal ROI diagnostics.

3.  Optimization  under  uncertainty:  constrained  budget  allocation  with  Monte  Carlo

evaluation and ratio-based feasibility under stochastic revenue.

4.  Decision support and auditability: a reproducible, transparent workflow linking public

data, interpretable models, and accounting-calibrated constraints.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW

Forecasting for planning and control. Forecasting research emphasizes that model evaluation must

reflect how forecasts are used. In planning settings, forecasts are typically produced repeatedly

(e.g.,  monthly  or  quarterly),  and  models  are  re-estimated  as  new  data  arrive.  Rolling-origin

backtests  therefore  provide  more  realistic  performance  estimates  than  a  single  train/test  split.

Classical ARIMA/SARIMA methods remain popular because they are relatively transparent and

can perform well on many economic series (Box et al., 2015). Model selection criteria such as

AIC and BIC provide principled ways to trade fit and complexity (Akaike, 1974; Schwarz, 1978).

Structural breaks are especially relevant for budgeting. Events such as recessions, pandemics, and

policy shocks can introduce level shifts and volatility spikes. In such environments, multivariate

models may help by borrowing strength across correlated categories. VAR models are a standard

tool  for  capturing  such  cross-series  dynamics  and  are  widely  used  in  macroeconometrics

(Lütkepohl, 2005). However, VAR models still assume linear dynamics and may struggle with

nonlinear regime changes.

Machine  learning  for  time  series.  Tree-based  machine  learning  methods,  such  as  gradient

boosting, often perform well on tabular predictive tasks because they can capture nonlinearities

and interactions. Friedman (2001) formalized gradient boosting as stagewise additive modeling.

In  forecasting  applications,  a  common  strategy  is  to  convert  a  time  series  into  a  supervised

learning  problem  using  lagged  features  and  rolling  statistics.  This  approach  can  approximate

nonlinear autoregressions and can be combined with cross-validation or walk-forward validation.

It does, however, sacrifice some of the interpretability and probabilistic structure of classical time-

series models.

Marketing mix and saturation modeling. Marketing response modeling has long recognized that

marginal  returns  diminish  with  spend.  Empirical  work  and  applied  MMM  frequently  use

saturation functions, such as Hill curves and S-shaped logistic curves, to model concave responses

and  avoid  unrealistic  linear  extrapolation  (Hanssens  et  al.,  2001).  In  addition,  many  practical

MMM  systems  include  adstock  (carryover)  effects,  reflecting  that  some  advertising  impacts

future  periods.  Our  demonstration  omits  adstock  because  the  Advertising  dataset  is  cross-

sectional,  but  the  optimization  framework  readily  accommodates  dynamic  response  functions

when time series data are available.

Optimization,  risk,  and  constraints  in  FP&A.  From  a  decision-analytic  perspective,  budget

allocation resembles portfolio selection: spending in each channel produces an uncertain return

with  diminishing  marginal  gains.  Mean-variance  optimization  (Markowitz,  1952)  provides  a

simple  template  for  balancing  expected  profit  and  risk.  Robust  optimization  and  stochastic

programming provide  stronger  guarantees  under  uncertainty,  including  chance constraints that

bound the probability of violating requirements (Bertsimas & Sim, 2004; Shapiro, Dentcheva, &

Ruszczyński, 2014). In corporate finance, constraints are often ratio-based (e.g., SG&A/revenue),

which introduces an additional challenge: the denominator is uncertain and can move against the

plan.

A  final  theme in  the literature  is  the gap  between  predictive  accuracy  and  decision  quality.  A

model that slightly reduces RMSE may not change the optimal decision if constraints bind or

response curves saturate early. Conversely, a model that is slightly less accurate in RMSE but

provides  better  tail  risk  estimates  could  improve  constraint  satisfaction.  This  motivates  our

emphasis on Monte Carlo evaluation and on reporting satisfaction rates, not only point forecasts.

III.  RESEARCH METHOD

We  instantiate  the  framework  with  three  public  data  sources  chosen  to  be  easy  to  reproduce

without  proprietary  inputs.  The  datasets  were  selected  to  cover  the  full  pipeline:  (i)  a  macro

demand proxy for forecasting, (ii) marketing response data for response estimation, and (iii) a

real, audited financial statement source for constraint calibration. Table 1 lists the data sources

and variables.

The macro module uses three components of Personal Consumption Expenditures: durable goods

(PCDG),  nondurable  goods  (PCND),  and  services  (PCESV).  These  series  are  available  in  the

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's FRED database and originate from the Bureau of Economic

A Constrained, Data-Driven Budgeting Framework …

Analysis’  National  Income  and  Product  Accounts  (Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  St. Louis,  2025a,

2025b, 2025c). Values are seasonally adjusted annual rates (SAAR) in billions of dollars.

SAAR  reporting  implies  a  simple  conversion  when  connecting  to  quarterly  firm  revenue:  a

quarterly SAAR value can be divided by four to obtain the corresponding quarterly level (in the

same  units).  We  use  this  conversion  in  the  calibration  step  that  maps  macro  demand  to  firm

revenue. This is an approximation; in applied settings, practitioners should ensure that the firm’s

revenue timing and the macro series definitions are aligned (e.g., fiscal vs calendar quarters).

We restrict to 2010Q1-2025Q3 to focus on contemporary dynamics and include a major structural

break  (COVID-19).  The  categories  behave  differently  during  2020:  durables  spike  (reflecting

substitution  toward  goods),  services  decline  sharply  (reflecting  mobility  restrictions),  and

nondurables remain relatively stable. These differences are useful for testing whether multivariate

forecasting adds value. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the demand proxy series used

in forecasting.

Marketing Response Data: Advertising.csv

The marketing module uses the Advertising dataset from the ISLR (James et al., 2021) package.

The  dataset  includes  200  observations  of  advertising  spend  across  three  channels  (TV,  radio,

newspaper) and their associated sales outcomes. Units are not explicitly defined in the textbook;

we treat them as normalized spend and sales units. The dataset is cross-sectional rather than time-

indexed, which simplifies response estimation but prevents modeling carryover (adstock) effects.

Nevertheless,

it  remains  a  useful  benchmark  for  understanding  channel

importance,

multicollinearity, and saturation.

Because the dataset is small, we emphasize simple models with clear diagnostics. We report cross-

validated accuracy and then prioritize interpretability for optimization. In real deployments, the

same  approach  can  be  applied  to  internal  channel  data  with  time  indices,  allowing  adstock,

seasonality, and targeting variables.

To ground constraints in audited accounting statements, we use Apple Inc.’s FY2025 Form 10-K

filed with the SEC (Apple Inc., 2025). We extract the statement of operations and the statement

of cash flows. The extracted values are used to compute: (i) gross margin rate, (ii) SG&A ratio,

(iii) R&D ratio, and (iv) operating cash flow coverage. These ratios serve as empirical anchors

for our budget constraints and for translating incremental revenue into operating profit.

Although our budgeting problem is generic and can be calibrated to any firm, using a real public

filing ensures that the constraints reflect realistic magnitudes. In practice, firms would calibrate

constraints to their internal statements and might also use additional constraints, such as minimum

marketing presence requirements, contractual commitments, or channel capacity limits.

B.  Data Reliability, Revisions, and Alignment Caveats

Public macroeconomic data are often revised after initial publication. National accounts series,

including PCE components, can be revised as source data are updated or methodologies change.

A real-time forecasting system must therefore decide whether to use latest-vintage data (the best

estimate of historical truth) or real-time vintages (what would have been known at the time). Our

demonstration uses the latest vintage values available on the FRED pages we queried. This is

appropriate for illustrating model comparisons, but it can overstate performance compared with

a strict real-time evaluation.

Alignment across data sources also matters

The PCE series is a calendar-quarter measure, while corporate financials are reported on fiscal

calendars that may not align exactly with calendar quarters. We abstract away these nuances by

treating quarter boundaries as compatible and by using ratio-based mapping. In applied FP&A

work, alignment should be handled explicitly-for example, by mapping macro quarters into fiscal

quarters using weighted averages or by using monthly data when available.

Finally, marketing  response  estimation  is  sensitive to  measurement  error  and  omitted-variable

bias. In practice, channel spend may correlate with other drivers (pricing, distribution, competitor

actions). Controlled experiments, geo tests, or causal inference tools can improve identification.

Our use of Advertising.csv is a stylized approximation  designed to highlight the mechanics of

optimization rather than to provide causal estimates.

C.  Models and Evaluations

This section describes (i) forecasting models for category demand, (ii) marketing response models

with diminishing returns, (iii) the calibration that links macro demand to firm revenue and links

marketing response to incremental revenue, and (iv) the constrained optimization problem. We

include explicit formulas and algorithmic descriptions to support auditability.

Demand Forecasting Models

We evaluate four demand forecasting approaches following Adiyatma et al. (2025) to produce

one-step-ahead  forecasts  at  a  quarterly  frequency.  Let  𝑦𝑘,𝑡denote  the  realized  demand  for  the

category 𝑘at time 𝑡. For each category, the corresponding forecast is denoted by y hat sub ented

by 𝑦̂𝑘,𝑡. In addition to category-level forecasts, we also assess aggregate demand, defined as (1).

𝑃𝑡 = ∑ 𝑦𝑘,𝑡
𝑘

        (1)

All  forecasting  models  are  re-estimated  at  each  rolling  forecast  origin  to  reflect  operational

forecasting practice. A summary of the model classes and their corresponding specifications is

provided in Table 3.

Evaluation Metrics

Forecast accuracy is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute

percentage  error  (MAPE).  For  a  test  sample  consisting  of  observations  𝑦𝑡and  corresponding

forecasts 𝑦̂𝑡, RMSE is defined as (2).

MAPE is computed as (3)

MAPE  is  scale-free  and  directly  interpretable  as  a  percentage  error.  While  it  can  place

disproportionate weight on observations with small denominators, this concern is mitigated in our

setting because demand levels are large and strictly positive. RMSE, by contrast, penalizes larger

forecast errors more heavily, which is informative when performance during stress periods is of

particular interest.

Rolling-origin evaluation

We adopt a rolling-origin design because it mirrors how forecasts are used in budgeting. In each

quarter, the model is trained on data up to the prior quarter and then used to predict the next. This

avoids  look-ahead  bias  and  captures  how  model  performance  evolves  as  more  data  becomes

available. The design also supports uncertainty estimation by collecting an empirical distribution

of forecast errors.

2.  Generate a one-step-ahead forecast 𝑦̂𝑡 = 𝑀(1).

3.  Compute the forecast error 𝜀𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦̂𝑡.

Output: Forecasts {𝑦̂𝑡}and errors {𝜀𝑡}over the test window.

Seasonal Naïve Baseline

The seasonal naïve benchmark is defined as (4).

𝑦̂𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 4       (4)

which captures quarterly seasonality by projecting demand from the corresponding quarter in the

previous  year.  Although  highly  parsimonious,  this  baseline  is  often  competitive  for  seasonal

economic time series. Including strong and transparent benchmarks is considered best practice in

forecasting evaluation, as it provides a meaningful reference point and helps avoid overstating

gains from more complex models.

SARIMAX

We  estimate  a  SARIMAX(1,1,1)×(0,1,1,4)  model.  The  (1,1,1)  component  captures  short-term

autoregressive and moving-average structure, while the seasonal (0,1,1,4) component captures

quarterly seasonality and seasonal shocks. Differencing (d=1, D=1) helps address nonstationary

level and seasonal patterns. We fix the order to keep the comparison transparent; in practice, one

could  select  orders  based  on  AIC/BIC  or  use  automated  procedures,  but  such  choices  can

complicate auditability.

learning rate of 0.05, a maximum tree depth of 3, and a subsampling ratio of 0.8. Given the limited

training  sample  (32  quarterly  observations  prior  to  the  test  period),  model  complexity  is

deliberately constrained by restricting tree depth and introducing subsampling as a regularization

mechanism.  This  specification  allows  the  model  to  capture  nonlinear  autoregressive  patterns

while maintaining robustness to noise and potential outliers.

VAR on log differences

We  fit  a  VAR  model  to  Δlog(y)  for  the  three-category  vector.  Log-differencing  approximates

growth rates and stabilizes variance. VAR then models each category’s growth rate as a linear

function of past growth rates of all categories. We select the lag order via AIC, with a maximum

of 4 lags. This provides a balance between flexibility and overfitting in a small sample.

Forecast aggregation

To obtain forecasts of aggregate demand 𝑃𝑡We compute the sum of the category-level forecasts.

This aggregation-by-summation approach is simple and widely used in practice. An alternative

strategy  would  be  to  model  aggregate  demand  directly  alongside  category-level  series  and

subsequently reconcile the resulting forecasts using hierarchical forecasting methods. We leave

such extensions for future work.

Marketing Response Modeling

The  marketing  module  estimates  how  marketing  spend  translates  into  outcomes  (Santoso  &

Priyadi, 2024). In many organizations, the core decision question is marginal: if we move $1M

from channel A to channel B, what is the expected effect on revenue or profit? Therefore, beyond

predictive  accuracy,  we  need  models  that  provide  stable  marginal  effects  and  that  can  be

interrogated for saturation.

We fit OLS, ridge, lasso, gradient boosting, and a Hill saturation model. OLS provides a baseline

and can be interpreted as a constant marginal effect. Ridge and lasso address multicollinearity by

shrinking  coefficients  (James  et  al.,  2021).  Gradient  boosting  provides  a  flexible  nonlinear

benchmark  (Friedman,  2001).  The  Hill  model  provides  an  interpretable  saturation  curve

consistent with diminishing returns (Hanssens et al., 2001).

Because the dataset is cross-sectional, we use standard K-fold cross-validation. This differs from

time-series  evaluation;  however,  it  is  appropriate  here  because  there  is  no  temporal  ordering.

RMSE and R² provide complementary views: RMSE measures absolute predictive error, while

R² measures the proportion of variance explained.

Hill saturation model

We parameterize the marketing response function as (5)

𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠(𝑠) = 𝛽0 + ∑ 𝛽𝑖ℎ(𝑠𝑖; 𝛼𝑖, 𝛾𝑖)    (5)
𝑖

where ℎ(⋅)denotes the Hill function. Model parameters are estimated using bounded nonlinear

least  squares.  Parameter  bounds  are  imposed  to  ensure  nonnegative  coefficients  𝛽𝑖and

economically  plausible  values  for  the  saturation  parameters  𝛼𝑖and  𝛾𝑖.  While  additional

components  such  as  adstock  effects  or  interaction  terms  can  be  incorporated,  the  baseline

saturation  specification  is  often  sufficient  to  identify  regions  of  diminishing  returns.  A

comparative evaluation of alternative marketing response specifications is reported in Table 4,

based on five-fold cross-validation using the Advertising dataset.

Calibrating Profitability and Liquidity Constraints

We calibrate profitability and liquidity parameters using data from Apple Inc.’s FY2025 Form

10-K. The statement of operations provides information on net sales, cost of sales, and operating

expenses, while the statement of cash flows reports net cash from operating activities. Based on

these  disclosures,  we  compute  the  following  ratios:  the  gross  margin  rate  𝑔 = Gross Margin/

Revenue;  the  selling,  general,  and  administrative  (SG&A)  ratio  𝑠 = SG&A/Revenue;  the

research  and  development  ratio  𝑟 = R&D/Revenue;  and  the  operating  cash  flow  ratio  𝑐FO =

CFO/Revenue.

The resulting estimates are 𝑔 ≈ 46.9%, 𝑠 ≈ 6.63%, 𝑟 ≈ 8.30%, and 𝑐FO ≈ 26.8%(Apple Inc.,

2025). These calibrated values are summarized in Table 6. In practice, financial constraints would

be derived from a firm’s own accounting data; Apple is used here as a publicly available and

auditable reference case.

Marketing as SG&A. Because SG&A aggregates multiple costs, we allocate a portion of SG&A

headroom  to  marketing  as  a  modeling  choice.  We  set  the  marketing  budget  cap  to  1.5%  of

revenue. This implies that the remaining SG&A (non-marketing) is 5.13% of revenue, matching

the  6.63%  total  SG&A  ratio  observed  in  the  filing.  This  choice  is  conservative  and  creates  a

feasibility region consistent with an audited cost structure.

In applied settings, firms might choose a different marketing cap based on strategic priorities or

on peer benchmarks. Importantly, the framework can treat the cap as a scenario parameter and

can evaluate how optimal budgets and satisfaction rates change as the cap changes. We present

such sensitivity analyses in the Results and Discussion section.

Linking Modules and Solving the Budget Allocation Problem

Link 1: Macro demand to firm revenue

We  link  the  macro  demand  proxy  𝑃𝑡to  firm-level  revenue  𝑅𝑡through  a  constant  market  share

parameter 𝜌. The parameter 𝜌is calibrated using the most recently observed macro demand and

the firm’s reported annual revenue, defined as (6).

𝜌 =

𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙
𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡

     (6)

Quarterly firm revenue is then approximated as (7).

𝑅̂𝑡+1 = 𝜌

𝑃̂𝑡+1
4

       (7)

This  mapping  assumes  a  stable  revenue  share  and  a  proportional  relationship  between  macro

demand and firm sales. In applied settings, 𝜌could alternatively be estimated by regressing firm

revenue on macro demand indicators or by incorporating industry-level market share information.

Link 2: Marketing Response to Incremental Revenue

The marketing response model based on the Advertising dataset produces sales outputs in abstract

units. To express these outputs in monetary terms, we calibrate a scaling factor such that a baseline

marketing expenditure—set at 1% of quarterly revenue—corresponds to a baseline revenue uplift

of 3% of quarterly revenue. This normalization ensures numerical coherence in the optimization

A Constrained, Data-Driven Budgeting Framework …

while maintaining a conservative calibration. The resulting scaling factor can be interpreted as

encoding an assumed average return on investment at the baseline spending level.

Operating profit objective

We define operating profit as a function of the marketing budget vector 𝑏 as (8)

𝛱(𝑏) = (𝑔 − 𝑜)(𝑅 + 𝛥𝑅(𝑏)) − ∑ 𝑏𝑖

       (8)

𝑜

where 𝑔denotes the gross margin rate and 𝑜 = 𝑟 + 𝑠otherrepresents the non-marketing operating

expense rate. Based on the calibration described above, 𝑔 − 𝑜 ≈ 0.335. Under this formulation,

incremental revenue generated by marketing activity contributes directly to operating profit.

Constraints

Two constraints are imposed. First, an SG&A budget constraint limits total marketing expenditure

to a fixed share of revenue use formula (9),

∑ 𝑏𝑖 ≤ 0.015 𝑅          (9)
𝑖

Second, a liquidity constraint restricts marketing spend to the portion of revenue supported by

operating cash flows (10),

∑ 𝑏𝑖 ≤ (𝑐𝐹𝑂 − 𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑛)𝑅,
𝑖

        (10)

where  𝑐min = 0.25denotes  the  minimum  cash  flow  ratio  required  for  operations.  Given  the

calibrated  values,  𝑐FO − 𝑐min ≈ 0.0179,  implying  that  the  SG&A  constraint  is  binding  in  the

present setting.

Chance Constraints and Robustness Interpretation

Ratio-based budget constraints are inherently stochastic when revenue is uncertain. Consider a

planner who selects a marketing budget  𝐵based on forecast revenue 𝑅̂. The SG&A constraint

requires as (11)

𝐵 ≤ 𝜅𝑅        (11)

where 𝜅denotes the allowable spending ratio (e.g., 1.5%) and 𝑅is realized revenue. When realized

revenue  falls  below  its  forecast  (𝑅 < 𝑅̂),  this  constraint  may  be  violated  even  if  the  planned

budget satisfies 𝐵 ≤ 𝜅𝑅̂.

A natural way to formalize the required safety buffer is through a chance constraint define as (12),

506      Journal of Technology Informatics and Engineering (JTIE), Vol. 4 No. 3, December 2025

Journal Link: https://jtie.stekom.ac.id/index.php/jtie/index

where 𝛿represents an acceptable probability of constraint violation (e.g., 5%).

ℙ(𝐵 ≤ 𝜅𝑅) ≥ 1 − 𝛿       (12)

Assuming a multiplicative revenue error model 𝑅 = 𝑒 𝑅̂with 𝑒 > 0, the chance constraint can be

rewritten as (13).

𝐵 ≤ 𝜅 𝑅̂ 𝑞𝛿            (13)
where 𝑞𝛿denotes the 𝛿-quantile of the revenue error factor  𝑒. This formulation highlights that
setting the budget at the deterministic cap 𝐵 = 𝜅𝑅̂implicitly corresponds to a violation probability

of  approximately  𝛿 ≈ ℙ(𝑒 < 1),  which  can  be  substantial  when  forecast  errors  are  roughly

symmetric.

In our empirical revenue error distribution, ℙ(𝑒 < 1)is close to 40%, indicating that spending at

the  deterministic  ratio  cap  would  breach  the  constraint  in  roughly  40%  of  realizations.

Consequently,  the  optimizer  selects  a  budget  strictly  below  𝜅𝑅̂,  implicitly  enforcing  a  more

conservative chance constraint.

We  implement  robustness  through  Monte  Carlo  evaluation  rather  than  an  explicit  quantile

constraint. This approach is transparent: decision-makers can see how many simulated scenarios

violate constraints and set λ or explicit satisfaction thresholds accordingly. In more sophisticated

implementations, one could embed chance constraints or robust uncertainty sets directly into the

optimization (Bertsimas & Sim, 2004; Shapiro et al., 2014).

Search procedure

Because the budget decision has three channels and a simplex constraint, a grid search is practical

and transparent. We discretize allocation shares  and budget utilization in 5% increments from

20% to 100% of the cap. This yields 3,927 candidate portfolios per scenario. Grid search ensures

global  coverage  and  avoids  local-optimization  failures  on  nonlinear  response  surfaces.  The

computational cost is modest: each portfolio is evaluated with 500 Monte Carlo scenarios using

vectorized computation.

Experimental Design

Demand Forecast Backtest

We perform a rolling one-step-ahead backtest from 2018Q1 to 2025Q3. At each origin, models

are fit on an expanding window starting at 2010Q1. This yields 31 forecast evaluations per series.

We report RMSE and MAPE and also evaluate the aggregate total PCE proxy. The expanding

window is appropriate because macro series often benefit from longer histories, but the rolling

A Constrained, Data-Driven Budgeting Framework …

design still captures structural changes.

Hyperparameter choices

For SARIMAX, we fix the order for transparency. For VAR, we select the lag order via AIC, with

a maximum of 4 lags to avoid overfitting. For gradient boosting, we use a moderate number of

estimators  and  shallow  trees,  reflecting  the  small  sample  size.  These  choices  emphasize

robustness over maximal fit.

Marketing Model Evaluation

Marketing response models are evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on the Advertising dataset.

We use CVRMSE and CVR² to compare predictive accuracy. Because our downstream optimizer

requires smooth marginal returns, we fit the Hill model with bounded parameters and use it for

budget allocation even when more flexible models exist.

Monte Carlo and Scenario Design

We create three macro scenarios by scaling the baseline revenue forecast by -5%, 0%, and +5%,

representing recession, baseline, and boom conditions. Within each scenario, we model forecast

uncertainty  by  bootstrapping  multiplicative  error  ratios  from  the  VAR  aggregate-demand

backtest. We draw N = 500 scenarios for Monte Carlo evaluation. For each candidate budget, we

compute the mean and standard deviation of operating profit and the SG&A constraint satisfaction

rate.

Risk-aversion parameter

We evaluate λ in {0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}. While λ has no universal meaning, it can be interpreted

as  the  number  of  dollars  of  expected  profit  the  planner  is  willing  to  sacrifice  to  reduce  profit

volatility by one dollar. In an organizational context, λ can be tuned to align with risk appetite or

to meet governance constraints.

IV.  RESULT

Table  7  reports  category-level  forecasting  accuracy,  and  Table  8  reports  accuracy  for  the

aggregate demand proxy. The results highlight three patterns. First, the seasonal naïve baseline is

difficult to beat for the smoother nondurable series, suggesting that complex models may provide

limited incremental value in stable categories. Second, durables and services exhibit larger errors,

reflecting greater volatility and structural change. Third, multivariate VAR improves aggregate

accuracy, consistent with cross-category substitution during shocks.

Figure 2 plots total demand forecasts versus actuals. Errors widen around 2020, as expected, but

the forecasts recover as the system adapts to post-shock dynamics. Figure 3 shows the durable

series, which features the strongest pandemic-era discontinuity. In this series, multivariate and

nonlinear models offer an advantage because they can learn the new regime more quickly than a

purely seasonal baseline.

Category  interpretation.  Nondurable  goods  show  the  lowest  MAPE,  reflecting  smoother

consumption patterns. Services show higher errors around the pandemic due to the abrupt collapse

and recovery. Durables show both a pandemic shock and post-shock volatility. From a planning

perspective, this suggests that budgeting buffers should be larger in categories whose demand is

more discretionary or more sensitive to shocks.

Table 4 compares marketing model accuracy. Gradient boosting provides the best predictive fit,

but the Hill model provides a structural decomposition into saturating channel contributions. In

the fitted Hill parameters (Table 5), the estimated coefficient for newspaper is essentially zero,

and marginal response plots confirm that newspaper provides negligible incremental sales over

the observed range. This aligns with the common interpretation of the Advertising dataset in ISLR

(James et al., 2021).

Figure 3. Durable Goods PCE (PCDG): Actual vs Forecasts by Model (Test Window)

Marketing Response Results

From a budgeting perspective, the main use of the response model is not to predict sales perfectly

but to estimate marginal ROI curves. Figure 5 shows that radio has the highest marginal returns

at  low  spend  and  then  saturates;  TV  saturates  more  slowly  and  provides  moderate  marginal

returns; newspaper has near-zero marginal return. These curves support a prioritization strategy:

allocate initial dollars to high-marginal channels, then diversify as saturation sets in.

Budget Optimization Results

Baseline  revenue  forecast.  The  VAR  model  fit  on  the  full  sample  forecasts  the  next  quarter

(2025Q4) PCE proxy as $21,153.6B SAAR. Mapping this to firm revenue via the share calibration

yields  a  baseline  quarterly  revenue  forecast  of  approximately  $104.2B.  The  SG&A-based

marketing cap (1.5% of revenue) corresponds to about $1.56B.

Optimal budget level and mix

Table 9 shows that the optimizer selects a spend level below the cap (≈0.97% of revenue) and

allocates approximately 25% to TV and 75% to radio. The resulting expected incremental revenue

is  about  $5.7B,  implying  an  incremental  revenue-to-spend  ratio  of  roughly  5.6×  under  our

conservative  calibration.  Because  only  about  33.5%  of  incremental  revenue  translates  into

operating  profit  after  non-marketing  operating  expenses,  the  incremental  operating  profit  is

around $0.9-1.0B net of spend.

Scenario Stability

Table 10 shows that the recommended channel shares remain stable across ±5% macro scenarios,

while absolute spend scales with the revenue forecast. This stability is desirable for organizational

execution  because  it  avoids  frequent  re-optimization  of  channel  mix;  teams  can  instead  scale

spend up or down while keeping the same allocation logic.

Risk Aversion and Buffers

Table 11 shows how risk aversion reduces budget utilization. Higher λ reduces budget utilization,

trading off mean profit for lower volatility. The key driver is that higher spend increases downside

risk when revenue is uncertain because spend is fixed in dollars while the constraint denominator

(revenue) fluctuates. Risk aversion therefore promotes buffers relative to deterministic caps.

Figure 6. Profit-Risk Trade-Off and Efficient Frontier Under Demand Uncertainty (Baseline)

Figure 6 visualizes the profit-risk cloud and the efficient frontier, with the selected λ=0 solution

highlighted.  Figure  7  summarizes  spend  by  channel  across  macro  scenarios.  Together,  these

figures provide a decision narrative: (1) there is a set of feasible allocations, (2) only a subset is

efficient,  and  (3)  the  chosen  point  reflects  a  risk  preference  and  a  buffer  against  constraint

violations.

Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analysis is essential in budgeting because key parameters are partially judgment-based.

In  our  instantiation,  two  assumptions  are  particularly influential: (i) the  SG&A marketing  cap

ratio κ, and (ii) the baseline effectiveness normalization φ that maps response-model units into

dollars. We therefore evaluate how the optimized budget changes when κ and φ vary.

Figure 7. Recommended Spend by Channel Across Macro Scenarios (λ=0)

Sensitivity to the SG&A Marketing Cap

Table 12 varies the marketing cap ratio from 1.0% to 2.0% of revenue. Two observations stand

out.  First,  the  optimizer’s  chosen  spend  is  largely  unchanged  across  caps  ≥1.5%  because

diminishing returns  bind  before  the  cap  does.  Second,  when  the  cap  is  tightened  to  1.0%, the

optimizer still chooses to spend close to the cap, which reduces the SG&A satisfaction rate under

uncertainty because there is less buffer.

Sensitivity to Marketing Effectiveness Normalization

Table 13 varies φ, the assumed baseline revenue lift produced by a 1% marketing spend. When φ

is low (2%), optimal spend falls substantially, reflecting weaker ROI. When φ is high (5%), the

risk-neutral optimizer spends the full cap, because marketing returns dominate costs. However,

spending  at  the  cap  reduces  SG&A  satisfaction  under  demand  uncertainty  to  about  60%,

illustrating again why deterministic caps can be fragile. In a real setting, φ would be estimated

from  historical  marketing  incrementality,  and  planners  might  impose  a  chance  constraint  on

satisfaction to prevent aggressive spend plans that frequently violate ratios.

These sensitivity analyses reinforce two practical lessons. First, if diminishing returns bind early,

debates about cap levels may be less consequential than debates about response curves and ROI.

Second,  when  marketing  is  perceived  as  highly  effective,  risk  controls  and  constraint  buffers

become even more important, as the optimizer will naturally push spending toward the cap.

V.  DISCUSSION

Practical implementation in FP&A

In a production environment, the demand module would ingest internal sales and pipeline data,

as well as macro proxies. The framework here provides a template for combining such data: the

forecasting  module  produces  a  predictive  distribution  rather  than  a  point  estimate,  and  that

distribution  feeds  directly  into  budget  feasibility  checks.  This  encourages  a  shift  from

deterministic to probabilistic budgets, where buffers and contingencies are explicitly accounted

for.

Governance and auditability

One barrier to adopting optimization in finance is trust. Decision makers need to know where

numbers  come  from,  and  auditors  may  require  traceability.  By  calibrating  constraints  from

audited  statements  (Apple’s  10-K)  and  by  using  public  data  sources,  our  demonstration

emphasizes  an  auditable approach.  In practice,  a  firm  would replace the  SEC calibration  with

internally audited statements and would log versions of each model, training data snapshots, and

optimization outputs.

Interpreting ‘do not spend the full cap’

Many budgeting processes treat a cap as a target: if the budget allows up to X, teams may spend

X. Our results show that a cap is merely a feasibility boundary. When response curves saturate,

optimal spend may be below the cap, and the difference is not necessarily underinvestment-it is

an economically rational response to diminishing returns. Moreover, spending below a ratio cap

provides a buffer against revenue downside.

A.  Limitations

The main limitation of this paper is that the data sources are not internally consistent: macro PCE

series represent the whole economy, while the Advertising dataset is a small cross-sectional toy

problem. We therefore use a normalization to map sales units to revenue dollars. This is sufficient

for demonstrating the framework but should not be interpreted as an estimate of true marketing

ROI  for  any  specific  firm.  Another  limitation  is  that  we  treat  marketing  response  as

contemporaneous;  real  marketing  effects  often  persist  over  time.  Dynamic  response  modeling

would change the optimization problem into a multi-period allocation problem.

B.  Extensions

Several  extensions  are  natural.  First,  exogenous  regressors  (inflation,  unemployment,  interest

rates) could be incorporated into SARIMAX or VARX models. Second, hierarchical forecasting

could  connect  product-line  forecasts  to  the  macro  proxy.  Third,  response  modeling  can

incorporate adstock and seasonality. Fourth, robust optimization can incorporate uncertainty in

response  parameters  directly,  rather  than  only  demand  uncertainty  (Bertsimas  &  Sim,  2004).

Finally, multi-objective optimization could incorporate goals such as brand equity or customer

acquisition, not just near-term profit.

C.  Practical Checklist for Deployment

To translate the framework into an operational FP&A process, teams can follow a checklist:

1.  Define the demand proxy and align calendars (fiscal vs calendar).

2.  Establish a rolling backtest protocol and baseline models.

3.  Choose  an  uncertainty  representation  (empirical  residuals,  parametric  distributions,  or

scenario sets).

4.  Estimate marketing response with explicit diminishing returns; validate with experiments

when possible.

5.  Calibrate constraints from audited statements and document any allocations (e.g., SG&A

split).

6.  Run  optimization  with  clear  objective  and  risk  parameters;  produce  a  Pareto  set  for

leadership review.

7.  Translate  outputs  into  budget  line  items  and  governance  metrics  (ratio  compliance,

downside cases).

8.  Monitor performance and update models on a fixed cadence; log versions for auditability.

D.  Model Risk Management, Control, and Ethics.

An optimization-driven budget recommendation is a form of decision automation, and therefore,

it should be treated as a model that requires governance. In many firms, model risk management

(MRM) practices are well established for credit and market risk models but less formalized for

FP&A models. Nonetheless, similar principles apply: document the training data vintage, record

the  model  version  and  hyperparameters,  preserve  a  backtest  trail,  and  define  monitoring

thresholds  for  drift.  In  the  proposed  pipeline,  drift  can  occur  in  the  demand  module  (macro

relationships change), in the response module (channel effectiveness changes), or in the constraint

module (margin structure changes). A practical safeguard is a challenger-model process in which

at least one baseline model (e.g., a seasonal naïve model for demand and a ridge regression model

for response) is always maintained and compared against the primary model.

Control  and  interpretability  are  especially  important  when  budgets  are  used  to  evaluate

performance. If a budget is produced by a black box, operating teams may struggle to understand

or accept targets, undermining execution. The framework here intentionally exposes intermediate

objects-forecast paths, residual distributions, response curves, and marginal returns-so leadership

can validate whether recommendations are directionally sensible. In applied settings, teams can

extend this with scenario narratives (e.g., ‘downside case’ and ‘upside case’) and explicit buffers

tied to chance-constraint satisfaction rates.

Ethical  and  privacy  considerations  become relevant when  the  pipeline is  deployed  on  internal

customer-level  data.  Marketing  response  estimation  may  rely  on  individual-level  impressions,

clicks,  and  conversions,  and  may  include  sensitive  attributes.  Organizations  should  follow

applicable privacy laws and internal policies, and, where possible, prefer aggregation and privacy-

preserving  analytics.  From  an  ethical  perspective,  budget  allocation  rules  should  avoid  using

sensitive attributes in ways that could result in discriminatory outcomes. These concerns further

motivate the use of interpretable saturation models and auditable constraints: they limit reliance

on opaque correlations that may not generalize or may be difficult to justify.

Recommended controls for an FP&A deployment include:

1.  Version control for data extracts and model code; reproducible pipelines.

2.  Backtest dashboards for forecast error and constraint satisfaction, refreshed each planning

cycle.

3.  Sensitivity  analysis  on  key  assumptions  (e.g.,  marketing  effectiveness  φ,  cap  κ)  as

standard deliverables.

4.  A ‘human-in-the-loop’ approval step for budget changes above a materiality threshold.

VI.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

We  presented  an  end-to-end  constrained  budgeting  framework  that  integrates  macro  demand

forecasting,  marketing  response  modeling  with  diminishing  returns,  and  SEC-calibrated

accounting constraints. Using public FRED PCE component data, we compared seasonal naïve,

SARIMAX, gradient boosting, and VAR models in a rolling backtest. Using Advertising.csv, we

compared predictive and interpretable response models and extracted marginal ROI curves.  By

combining these modules, we solved a constraint-aware budget allocation problem and evaluated

it  under  demand  uncertainty  via  Monte  Carlo  simulation.  The  results  emphasize  that  optimal

budgets  may  be  below  ratio  caps  and  that  buffers  are  essential  when  constraints  depend  on

uncertain  revenue.  The  framework  is  reproducible,  modular,  and  adaptable  to  internal  FP&A

systems.

Though the sheer volume of data that is collected is immense, it is the rare categories that are often the most
important in many high-impact domains, ranging from financial fraud detection in online transaction net-
works to emerging trend detection in social networks, from spam image detection on social media platforms
to rare disease diagnosis in medical decision support systems. The unique challenges of rare category analysis
include (1) the highly skewed class distribution; (2) the non-separable nature of the rare categories from the
majority classes; (3) data and task heterogeneity; and (4) the time-evolving property of the input data sources.
This survey reviews state-of-the-art techniques used in complex rare category analysis, where the majority
classes have a smooth distribution while the minority classes exhibit the compactness property in the feature
space or subspace. Rare category analysis aims to identify, characterize, represent, and interpret anomalies
that not only show statistical significance but also exhibit interesting patterns (e.g., compactness, high-order
structures, showing in a burst). We introduce our study, define the problem setting, and describe the unique
challenges of complex rare category analysis. We then present a comprehensive review of recent advances
that are designed for this problem setting, from rare category exploration without any label information to
rare category exposition that characterizes rare examples with a compact representation, from the represen-
tation of rare patterns in a salient embedding space to the interpretation the prediction results and providing
relevant clues for the end-users’ interpretation. Finally we discuss potential challenges and shed light on the
future directions for complex rare category analysis.1

1 INTRODUCTION

D. Zhou and J. He

The so-called era of big data is defined in part by the sheer volume of multimodel data that are
being collected from various platforms (e.g., graphs, images, text). Yet, it is the rare occurrences—
those data points that are significantly different from other observations in the data—that often
are of greatest importance in many high-impact domains: from financial fraud detection in online
transaction networks to emerging trend detection in social networks, from spam image detection
on social media platforms to rare disease diagnosis in medical decision support systems. Anomaly
detection refers to the process by which these rare occurrences are identified. Many techniques
have been proposed to characterize anomalies in domains such as financial fraud detection [102],
insider threat prediction [66], novelty detection [92], gene disease discovery [17], emerging trend
tracking [28], network intrusion detection [58], astronomy [133], spam image detection [93], and
rare disease diagnosis [117].

1.1 Anomalies vs. Rare Category Examples
The branch of data mining concerned with identifying anomalies or outliers2 has a lengthy history.
In 1980, Douglas M. Hawkins proposed the definition of outliers [47] that is shown in Definition 1.1.
Since this time, the problem of anomaly detection or outlier detection has been generalized and
studied in various contexts, such as those of high-dimensional numerical data [173], sequential
data [27], time-series data [45], graph data [7], and financial data [36, 113]. This wide-ranging
exploration has yielded many domain-specific terms for outliers, including novelties events, sur-
prising changes, frauds outbreak.

Definition 1.1. Hawkins’s Definition of Outliers [47]

An outlier is an observation that differs so much from other observations as to arouse sus-
picion that it was generated by a different mechanism.

Though researchers have had tremendous success applying anomaly detection methods in var-
ious domains, not all anomalies detected are necessarily useful or relevant to the actual events of
interest. In fact, most anomalies are uninteresting data points that either are drawn from a known
distribution of noise or correspond to combinations of features that are irrelevant to downstream
applications [109]. For instance, in Figure 1, we present a set of sky images captured by ground-
based telescopes as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (program).3 According to the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey 99.9% of its captured sky images (e.g., the top row of Figure 1) can be well
explained based on known phenomena of the universe (e.g., discovered stars, comets, nebulae);
only 0.1% of the images (e.g., the bottom row of Figure 1) are anomalies. Moreover, among the
anomalies, 99% of the images (e.g., bottom left image in Figure 1) are of no interest to astronomers
and are caused by diffraction spikes of satellite trails or artifacts of the telescope. Only 1% of the
instances (a minuscule 0.001% of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database) are useful and may lead
to new scientific discoveries (e.g., the bottom right image in Figure 1). Here, we refer to anomalies
that are not only statistically significant but also interesting as rare category examples and the
problem of studying rare category examples as rare category analysis. Figure 2 illustrates the
relationship among anomalies, uninteresting anomalies, and useful anomalies (i.e., rare category
examples), where rare category examples are a subset of anomalies that are not only statistically
significant but also compact in the feature space.

We provide the following general definition of rare category analysis: Given a dataset D of n

the class label for the ith node, yi = 0, corresponds to the majority class (i.e., normal examples)
and yi ∈ {1, . . . , C − 1} corresponds to the rare categories (i.e., suspicious examples). Note that
rare category analysis is the problem of studying patterns in the minority classes.4 In particular,
for cases in which more than one majority class is observed, we treat all the majority classes as a
single class once the underlying distribution of each majority class is sufficiently smooth [49]. In
general rare category analysis, we make the following assumptions regarding the support region
of the majority class and minority classes:

Assumption 1. Smoothness Assumption for Majority Class. Given a highly imbalanced

dataset, the distribution of the support region of each majority class is sufficiently smooth.

Assumption 2. Compactness Assumption for Minority Class. Given a highly skewed dataset,

the minority class examples can be represented as a compact cluster in the feature space.

These assumptions are made to ensure that the rare categories are identifiable and meaningful.
To better capture this, let us look first at the example in Figure 3(a), where the majority class
(shown in blue) has a Gaussian distribution with large variance on the left, while the minority

class (shown in orange) corresponds to a peak with small variance on the right. If the minority
class is not compact and violates Assumption 2 (e.g., the minority class in Figure 3(b) is uniformly
distributed in the feature space), then no algorithm can perform better than random sampling. If
the distribution of the majority class is not smooth and violates Assumption 1 (e.g., the majority
class in Figure 3(c) consists of multiple narrow and sharp peaks just like the minority class), then
the minority class cannot be identified with a clear clue. Based on the assumptions related to rare
category examples, we propose the following definition of complex rare category analysis:

Definition 1.2. Complex Rare Category Analysis

Complex rare category analysis refers to the problem of detecting, characterizing, repre-
senting, and interpreting rare examples from underrepresented minority classes in a highly
imbalanced dataset.

1.2 Challenges of Rare Category Analysis
We first discuss the key challenges associated with rare category analysis. Unlike the conventional
anomalies, rare category examples have the following unique characteristics:

• C1. Rarity. It is often the case that the patterns of interest are sporadic in the collected data.
For example, in financial fraud detection, the vast majority of financial transactions are le-
gitimate; only a small number may be related to money laundering, and they often exhibit
similar traits. Another example is network intrusion detection. New malicious network ac-
tivities are hidden among huge volumes of routine network traffic, and network intrusions
of the same type are often similar to one another.

• C2. Label Scarcity. Given the high skewness and non-separable nature of rare categories,
labeling rare category examples is extremely expensive. In various real applications, such as
money laundering detection, synthetic identity (ID) detection, and network intrusion detec-
tion, we are usually required to learn from a handful of labeled examples.

• C3. Non-separability. Rare categories are often non-separable from the majority classes in
the feature space. For example, from the alarm of grid hacking (e.g., NotPetya) to the swift
growth in cyber-criminals (e.g., coin-mining attacks), the past several years have served as
a stark reminder of an emerging type of terrorist attack (i.e., adversarial attacks). Such mali-
cious attacks are designed to bypass current detection systems by camouflaging themselves
as normal instances, i.e., the support regions of normal instances, and malicious attacks are
non-separable in the given feature space.

• C4. Data Heterogeneity. To identify the rare categories, we often need to collect raw data
from different sources, at different time stamps using different techniques. Each data source
might have different types of users and attributes. Of such highly heterogeneous raw data,

only a subset (e.g., data sources, attributes) may be relevant to the identification of the rare
category examples (e.g., security threats).

• C5. Dynamics. The raw input data continuously change over time; thus, extracting and
modeling useful information from such dynamic systems plays an important role in rare
category analysis.

1.3 An Overview of Complex Rare Category Analysis
Complex rare category analysis can be divided into four tasks: detecting, characterizing, repre-
senting, and interpreting rare category examples. Figure 4 presents an overview of rare category
analysis, from the exploration step without any ground truth to the exposition step that aims to
characterize rare examples with a compact representation, from representing rare patterns in a
salient space to providing insightful interpretation over the prediction results.

• T1: Rare Category Exploration. In this task, we start from de-novo and do not have any
label information for the data. The goal is to identify at least one example from each rare
category with minimal help from labeling oracles. We begin with a comprehensive review
of some relevant topics, including anomaly detection [7, 26], outlier detection [57], and pre-
dictive modeling on imbalanced domains [20]; then we elaborate on popular approaches to
rare category exploration in both static and dynamic environments.

• T2: Rare Category Exploitation.

In this task, we use one/a few labeled examples from
each class that may have been obtained from the exploratory step discussed in T1. The pri-
mary goal is to capture a compact representation of the rare categories in various data for-
mats by learning from a few-shot annotated data points. Depending on the availability of
a multimodal representation of examples, rare category detection can be categorized as ho-
mogeneous rare category exploration or heterogeneous rare category exploration. In the
former setting [52, 109], all the examples are homogeneous, as they are collected from the
same data source or have identical traits; in the latter one [41, 79, 160, 163], we aim to identify
rare categories in the presence of data heterogeneity.

• T3: Understanding Rare Categories: This task , which may entail representing rare exam-
ples in a salient embedding space, visualizing the data distribution, or interpreting the under-
lying prediction process in the previous steps (T1 and T2), serves as an investigation step for

end-users. We systematically discuss recent advances in representation learning [60, 166],
interpretation [30, 84, 89], and visual analytic systems [81, 105] for rare category analysis.

1.4 Previous Work and Our Contributions to the Literature

Extensive literature surveys on the topics of imbalanced classification, anomaly/outlier detection,
and fraud detection have been published in the past decade. In the context of imbalanced classifi-
cation, He and Garcia [48] cover the development of research on learning from imbalanced data.
In the context of anomaly/outlier detection, Hodge and Austin [57] introduces a literature review
of contemporary techniques for outlier detection, and Chandola et al. [26] presents a comprehen-
sive overview of the research on anomaly detection. A series of surveys and special-issue journal
articles that target more specific problems and applications in the context of anomaly/outlier detec-
tion have also been published. In particular, Zimek et al. [173] studies the problem of unsupervised
outlier detection in high-dimensional numerical data, Chandola et al. [27] considers anomalies in
discrete sequences, Gupta et al. [45] focus on outlier detection for temporal data, Akoglu et al. [7]
attends to graph-based anomaly detection algorithms, Chalapathy and Chawla [25] provide an
overview of deep-learning-based anomaly detection techniques, and , Edge and Falcone Sampaio
[36] and Phua et al. [113] survey methodologies of fraud detection.

However, very few works present a comprehensive overview of complex rare category analysis.
He [49] is one of the first to present an end-to-end investigation of rare categories, but the intro-
duced methodologies are largely restricted to the tabular data in the static setting. Responding to
the gap in the literature, here we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of complex
rare category analysis from several perspectives:

• Data Perspective. Unlike the previous surveys on outlier detection, anomaly detection, and
rare category analysis, our study reviews state-of-the-art techniques for handling rich data
types, such as text/blogs, electronic health records, weblink graphs, and streaming data.
• Task Perspective. We provide a comprehensive overview of end-to-end complex rare category
analysis, from rare category exploration without any label information, to rare category ex-
position characterizing rare examples with compact representation, from representing rare
patterns in a salient embedding space to interpreting the prediction results and providing
relevant clues for end-users’ investigation.

1.5 Survey Roadmap
We present our survey in five parts sections. In Section 2, we focus on the de novo step of rare
category analysis, i.e., rare category exploration, which aims to find the initial example from each
minority class in the unsupervised setting. In Section 3, we discuss the following step, rare category
exploitation, which relies on the output of rare category exploration (i.e., initially labeled exam-
ples) to characterize the rare categories. In Section 4, we stress the importance of interpretation in
rare category analysis in various highly regulated industries, such as finance and healthcare. We
systematically discuss how to understand rare category analysis from the following two aspects:
(1) data diagnosis (i.e., How are the data distributed? Which piece of information is most valuable
for a given task?); and (2) model diagnosis (i.e., Why does the model make a certain prediction on a
particular piece of information?). Section 5 enumerates the popular benchmark datasets and repre-
sentative baseline models. In Section 6, we conclude our study and share our thoughts regarding
future research directions, such as how to ensure performance in the presence of noise, missing
data, and adversarial examples and how to generate task-specific rare category examples (e.g.,
money laundering activity) given a specific domain (e.g., transaction networks). A general outline
follows:

2 RARE CATEGORY EXPLORATION

Considered the de novo step in rare category analysis, rare category exploration, a.k.a. rare cate-
gory detection, aims to propose initial rare category examples to the labeling oracle in the given
dataset. Given an unlabeled, imbalanced dataset, the most natural method of rare category explo-
ration is random sampling. In this method we randomly draw examples without replacement to
be labeled by the oracle until at least one example from each minority class has been identified.
However, due to the rarity of rare categories (e.g., the proportion of a rare category is 0.01%), an
extensive number (i.e., 10,000) of labeling requests is required to spot the rare example. It is thus
worthwhile to develop more effective and efficient sampling strategies to address this rare category
exploration problem. In this section, we formally define the problem of rare category exploration.
We primarily aim to address (C1) rarity, (C4) data heterogeneity, and (C5) dynamics in rare category
analysis.

Problem 1. Rare Category Exploration.
Given: (i) an unlabeled dataset D, (ii) a small budget B for querying domain experts.
Find: the set of initial examples Q from each rare category.

In real-world applications of rare category exploration, researchers have customized Problem 1
for different data formats, including tabular data, time-series data, and graph-structured data. In
the following three subsections, we review the existing literature on rare category exploration
from a data perspective (e.g., static data vs. dynamic data, tabular data vs. graph-structured data).

2.1 Rare Category Exploration for Static Patterns

The techniques currently used in the static setting have been primarily designed in active-learning-
based schemes. The general procedure of this paradigm is presented in Figure 5. The key idea
behind the sample-selection-based methods is to learn a detector that can gradually search for the
potential rare examples by learning from the examples labeled by the oracle. We often assume that

the labels obtained from the oracles are under a fixed budget B. Thus, the goal is to maximally
improve the prediction accuracy with the minimum number of labeling requests to the oracle. As
shown in Figure 5, rare category exploration proceeds iteratively. In each iteration, the program
starts with the oracle annotating a few samples. Then the sample-selection-based methods are
updated based on the newly labeled examples and further predict a small number of potential
rare category examples in the sense that obtaining labels for them further improves the prediction
accuracy. The program terminates once all the target rare categories have been captured. Next,
we elaborate on the existing rare category exploration algorithms designed for tabular and graph-
structured data.

2.1.1 Tabular Data. Given an unlabeled dataset with n samples D = {x1, . . . , xn }, where each
sample xi , i = 1, . . . , n comes with d-dimensional features xi = {x 1
}, our goal is to identify
at least one example from each class y = 1, . . . , m with the minimum number of queries. The work
of Peleg and Moore [109] is one of the first attempts at rare category exploration. The authors
develop a mixture model to fit the data and design a family of hint selection methods to select the
rare examples with the help of a human expert. Experimental results using different hint selection
methods show the efficacy of the proposed rare category detection framework. He and Carbonell
[52] study the rare category exploration problem when the minority classes are non-separable
from the majority classes. Specifically, the authors develop a nearest-neighbor-based rare category
detection algorithm named NNDM, which gradually selects examples with the maximum changes
in the local density on a certain scale and asks for labeling from the oracle. The algorithm works
as follows: Given the prior p of each rare category C, the algorithm first estimates the number of
examples K = n × p in C. Then, the algorithm represents each example xi in terms of a vector that
is composed of the distances from its K-nearest neighbors. By obtaining the minimum distance r
among all samples, the algorithm constructs a hyper-ball with radius r for each example (as center)
and computes the local density as the number of enclosed examples within the hyper-ball:

Hyberball(xi , r ) = {x|x ∈ D, (cid:5)x − xi (cid:5) ≤ r }

(1)

LocalDensity(xi ) = |Hyberball(xi , r )|
(2)
To measure the degree of local density changes around each sample (i.e., hyper-ball), the authors
propose using the difference in the local density between xi and its neighbors:

DensityChange(xi )

=

⎧⎪⎨
⎪
⎩

maxxk ∈Hyberball(xi,r )[LocalDensity(xi ) − LocalDensity(xk )] xi is labeled
−∞
Otherwise

(3)

In particular, the function DensityChange assigns each labeled example’s scores with −∞ to avoid
duplicated labeling requests. Finally, the algorithm returns the examples with the largest local

density changes to the oracle for labeling:

(4)

Query = argmaxxi ∈ DDensityChange(xi )
Theoretical analysis shows that the methods effectively select examples on both the boundary
and in the interior of the rare categories. In particular, when the rare categories are compact, the
majority class distribution is locally smooth, and the sample space is sufficiently large, NNDM is
guaranteed to identify at least one example coming from each minority class with probability 1 −δ
after (cid:8) 2α

(cid:9) iterations, where δ ∈ (0, 1), α, and r2 are all positive parameters.

Despite the promising results of NNDM with theoretical guarantees, the algorithm’s perfor-
mance largely relies on prior information (e.g., number of classes, proportion of minority classes).
To alleviate the restriction on prior knowledge, He and Carbonell [50] propose a prior-free rare
category detection algorithm named SEDER. The intuition of this algorithm lies in the observation
that a region with an abrupt local density change has a higher probability of observing the rare
classes. Unlike He and Carbonell [52] and He et al. [53], SEDER picks the potential rare examples
with large neighborhood density changes for labeling by performing semi-parametric density es-
timation. SEDER introduces a prior-free DensityChange function, which is defined as the norm of
the gradient of the local density function:

DensityEstimation is a kernel density estimation function with Gaussian kernel [37], and bl is
a positive parameter. In the presence of noisy data and irrelevant features, He and Carbonell [51]
formulate the rare category exploration problem via a co-selection scheme, which recovers the
relevant features and representative examples from the rare categories. To obtain the optimal sets
of relevant features and rare examples, He and Carbonell propose an effective searching procedure
(i.e., PALM) based on an augmented Lagrangian function to solve the optimization problem. In par-
ticular, PALM is designed in an alternative fashion so that the relevant features and the minority
class examples can be found.

Recently, a paradigm shift has been observed in the data mining community: from how to ac-
curately detect rare categories to how to ensure trustworthiness in rare category exploration. For
instance, Ahmadian and Lindsten [4], Kaur et al. [67], and Liu et al. [83] study how to ensure robust-
ness in detecting rare events, especially in the out-of-distribution setting. Shekhar et al. [120] point
out that algorithmic fairness and rare category exploration are dual problems when encountering
the data imbalance issue. The authors propose a fairness-aware method that jointly optimizes pre-
diction accuracy and statistical parity. Deng et al. [32] study the hardness bias in the autoencoder-
based rare category detection methods and propose a plug-and-play error calibration method to
mitigate the hardness bias issue.

2.1.2 Graph-Structured Data. In many fields, graphs offer a unifying data structure for model-
ing relational data. As a result, extensive research related to rare category exploration has been
conducted to spot the rare category entities in graph-structured data. Formally speaking, given an
unlabeled graph D = G(V, E), where V and E denote the sets of nodes and edges in G, respec-
tively, our target is to identify initial nodes and edges from each of the rare categories. He et al. [53]
extends the idea of He and Carbonell [52] to graph-structured data by proposing a graph-based rare
category detection algorithm named GRADE. The algorithm starts computing a global similarity
matrix S motivated by manifold ranking [169], which is used to obtain a compact representation

of the examples from the minority classes:

S = (I − αD

− 1

2 )

(6)

where I denotes the identify matrix, D denotes the diagonal matrix, and A denotes the adjacency
matrix of G. A prior-guided k-nearest-neighbor matrix is then computed to capture the sharp
local density changes near the boundary of minority classes and thus make it easier to capture the
rare patterns. In addition to developing GRADE, the authors develop a variation named GRADE-LI,
which requires only an upper bound on the proportion of each rare category. GRADE-LI can work
with the data when a detailed class-membership distribution of the data is not available to the
users.

Except for the plain graphs, data often exhibit node-level and edge-level heterogeneity for var-
ious critical tasks in security, finance, and medicine, among other fields. Each node or edge is
associated with a specific type in such data (referred to as a heterogeneous graph). To accommo-
date heterogeneous graphs, researchers have studied how to detect anomalies and rare events in
the unsupervised setting. For example, Sun et al. [127] propose the notion of neighborhood for-
mation for a bipartite graph, which computes the relevance scores of all nodes to a query node v
and define the neighborhood of v as the set of nodes with higher relevance scores. Based on the
neighborhood formation, the authors develop an anomaly detection algorithm to spot the abnor-
mal nodes with low “normality” scores. Based on similar intuition, Tong and Lin [132] propose
a non-negative residual matrix factorization framework named NrMF, which aims to detect the
malicious group of entities as well as provide interpretation of prediction results for data analysts.
NrMF is built upon the conventional matrix factorization mechanism,

A = FG + R

(7)

where F and G are low-rank factorized matrices, and R is the residual matrix that indicates rare
examples on the bipartite graphs. To interpret the predictions via NrMF, Tong and Lin impose a
non-negative constraint on the residual matrix R, such that all entries in R are larger than 0. Intu-
itively, higher value of the entry in R indicates a higher probability of existing rare and abnormal
examples. To solve the optimization problem of non-negative residual matrix factorization, the au-
thors develop a fast optimization algorithm to incrementally compute the residual matrix via the
rank-1 approximation, which runs in linear w.r.t. the size of the graph.

More recently, extensive attempts have been made to predict rare category events by developing
customized graph neural networks (GNNs) to depict the structure of a graph and learn repre-
sentations of various graph signals (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs). GNNs-based approaches are
generally designed based on the message-passing scheme, which is given as follows:

sage” from node v’s neighborhood N (v). Deng et al. [34] propose a graph convolutional net-

information from the raw data. The proposed framework first extracts graph representations of
the events; it then documents and learns to predict the occurrence of future events and to identify
the events of interest (i.e., rare categories). Zhong et al. [162] studies the problem of rare category
detection in videos, where each video is decomposed into n snippets (i.e., nodes in the constructed
video graph), the edges between each pair of snippets are defined based on feature similarity, and

multaneously clean noisy signals in the constructed video graph and predict abnormal actions.
Goodge et al. [42] investigate the relationship between the local outlier methods [69] and the

local rare examples.

2.2 Rare Category Exploration for Dynamic Patterns

The existing literature on detecting rare patterns in temporal data is very rich, with no universal
abstract categorization capable of capturing all the developed techniques in this direction. Accord-
ingly, we here focus on rare category exploration for time-series data and temporal graphs.

2.2.1 Time-Series Data. In the setting of time-series data, the rare categories can be observed
at both the sequence level and the segment level, as shown in Figure 6. For example, most electro-
cardiogram (ECG) signals are normal (i.e., collected from healthy people); only a small portion of
them is abnormal (i.e., collected from patients with heart disease). Moreover, within the abnormal
ECG signals, only a few segments are abnormal (e.g., heart arrhythmia); the rest are normal. Early
studies of rare category exploration for time-series data [18, 21, 22, 65, 80, 97, 100, 108, 118, 150]
are closely related to the outlier detection and disorder detection methods. They rely largely on
distanced-based mechanisms [97, 101, 116, 119] that define various similarity measurements [45] of
temporal sequences and segments and then identify rare patterns deviating from the normal ones.
For instance, Cao et al. [22] propose a scalable distance-based detection algorithm for high-volume
data streams. This algorithm has been found to be optimal in terms of CPU costs. Begum and
Keogh [18] study the problem of discovering rare time-series motifs (i.e., repeated subsequences)
from unbounded streams. To address the rarity issue of the time-series motif in a never-ending
stream, Begum and Keogh develop a “sticky cash” algorithm that adopts a Bloom filter to remem-
ber every incoming subsequence and efficiently detects rare motifs in the unbounded real-valued
time series. To facilitate the use of distance-based methods, Yeh et al. [150] introduce a fast compu-
tational algorithm for time-series/subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search that has strong implica-
tions for and promising results for the task of time-series discord discovery. Finally, Goodge et al.
[43] introduce a robust random-cut data structure to produce a sketch or synopsis of time-series
data. Using this structure, the authors propose a scalable anomaly detection algorithm by gradually
updating the time-series sketch in a continuous data stream.

A key motivation of the aforementioned methods is that the distributions of rare categories
(minorities) deviate from the normal distribution (majorities). However, there are some obvious
limitations to this idea in practice. The identified examples are often not the targets of researchers’
interest, which are drawn from noise or combinations of irrelevant features. Zhou et al. [164] as-
sume that the targets of our interest are rare and drawn from a compact distribution. Under this
assumption, Zhou et al. propose a bi-level generative model that aims to jointly characterize the
rare temporal pattern at the time-series and subsequence levels. Recent advances in deep learning
architectures have led to a surge in research interest related to developing deep models to char-
acterize and detect rare temporal patterns in high-impact applications. Tuor et al. [134] present a
deep unsupervised framework for detecting insider threat in online data streams. This framework
outputs a ranked list of anomaly scores of individual user behaviors; Li et al. [77] develop a gen-
erative adversarial network (GAN) for unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection. Unlike
conventional distance-based methods and supervised methods, the proposed framework detects
rare temporal patterns by using the GAN-trained generator and discriminator to compute the
discrimination and reconstruction anomaly score (DR-Score); Shen et al. [121] propose a re-
current network ensemble called the recurrent autoencoder, which is designed to characterize and
capture the abnormal time-series segments at multiple resolutions; finally, Deng and Hooi [33]
and Zhang et al. [159] propose modeling the between-sensor dependence relationship to identify
abnormal time segments in multivariate time series.

2.2.2 Temporal Graphs. Many real-world systems, including social networks, communication
networks, and gene interaction networks, are intrinsically dynamic and can be represented as
temporal graphs. In the past few years, researchers have proposed several rare category explo-
ration models for temporal graphs [3, 13, 34, 59, 76, 89, 90, 115, 125, 140, 149, 153, 167, 168].
The existing work can be categorized as discrete temporal graphs [154] or continuous temporal
graphs [85, 103, 171] based on the method of data collection used in the particular application
domain.

The discrete temporal graphs are often referred to as a time-evolving graphsn wherein the
˜G = {G (1), G (2), . . . , G (T ) }. Each snapshot
data D is presented as a sequence of snapshots
G (t ) = (V (t ), E (t ) ), t = 1, 2, . . . ,T is composed of a collection of nodes V (t ) and edges E (t ) at
timestamp t. To identify rare examples on ˜G, the static methods are extended to the dynamic
setting. For example, Sun et al. [126] propose a parameter-free model that can monitor grouped
outliers and their changes in a stream of graphs. The algorithm is designed based on minimum
description length (MDL), which allows users to discover the changes in communities as well
as in points in time. Araujo et al. [14] develop a fast incremental tensor analysis approach that can
discover both transient and periodic/repeating communities in dynamic graphs. Sricharan and Das
[125] define a commute-time distance that captures node relationship changes and allows tradi-
tional distance-based methods to be used with discrete temporal graphs. Lee et al. [76] propose a
discrete-time exponential-family random graph model to identify clusters in time-evolving graphs.
Manzoor et al. [90] study the problem of anomaly detection in streaming heterogeneous graphs by
proposing a clustering-based anomaly detection approach that can simultaneously address the het-
erogeneity and streaming nature of the input data. In particular, Manzoor et al. introduce a novel
embedding mechanism that can encode the heterogeneous streaming graph into a vector represen-
tation that is then used to perform clustering and identify anomalous patterns. Appel et al. [13]
proposes a factorization framework that can jointly model the distribution of dynamic connections
and attributes and track the evolution of evolving communities. Despite their success, the detec-
tion algorithms often suffer from high computational costs, especially when extensive snapshots
are given or when the algorithms are applied in the online setting. To address this issue, Zhou

et al. [167, 168] propose an incremental rare category exploration scheme that aims to gradually
update the static rare category exploration models based on the local changes on a new snapshot
without learning from scratch. In particular, Zhou et al. propose a closed-form solution to update
the global similarity matrix S (defined in Equation (6)) in the dynamic setting:

S(t ) = S(t −1) + α

S(t −1)uvT S(t −1)
I + vT S(t −1)u

(10)

where u and v are one-hot vectors indicating the source nodes and target nodes of the updated
edges, respectively; I denotes the identity matrix; and S(t ) and S(t −1) are the global similarity matri-
ces at the timestamps t and (t −1), respectively. Moreover, to efficiently and effectively compute the
density changes, DensityChange(xi ), a theoretical condition, is provided to determine whether the
hyper-ball Hyberball(xi , r ) is required to update from the previous timestamp. Yasami and Safaei
[149] study the problem of anomaly detection in dynamic social networks, wherein both network
structure and node attributes are observed over time. The proposed framework jointly models two
processes, i.e., (1) the normal modeling component and (2) the anomaly detection component, to
track the abnormal relationship between nodes’ features and link generation in dynamic social
networks. Agarwal et al. [3] introduce a novel community scoring metric called permanence and
proposes an incremental algorithm to track the evolution of network communities in the dynamic
setting. The theoretical analysis shows that the updating procedure of the proposed algorithms
leads to permanence maximization in the dynamic networks. Furthermore, to guarantee model effi-
ciency and algorithmic fairness, Fu et al. [39] introduce a fairness-aware clique-preserving spectral
clustering algorithm that generalizes the static clique clustering methods to the dynamic setting
via fairness-aware edge filtering and incremental eigenpair updating.

Continuous temporal graphs are also called fine-grained temporal graphs or temporal interaction
graphs, where the temporal graph is presented as a sequence of timestamped edges. It is intractable
to directly generalize the static rare category exploration approaches used in discrete temporal
graphs to continuous temporal graphs. For this reason, Manzoor et al. [90] propose to represent
continuous temporal graphs with a vector representation, which is easy to compute and preserves
the contextual information of the continuous temporal graphs. With the learned continuous tem-
poral graph representation, Manzoor et al. develop a fast and memory-efficient detection algo-
rithm to process any incoming nodes and edges and identify anomalies in real time. Hollocou et al.
[59] subsequently studies the problem of identifying grouped anomalies in the edge streaming
setting. In particular, the data are presented as a sequence of streaming edges. The authors pro-
pose a streaming algorithm with the theoretical justification that performs graph clustering with
only three integers per node and does not keep any edge in memory. Amjadi and Tulabandhula
[10] propose a block-structured time-series model for detecting communities on time-evolving
graphs. This approach can capture both the link persistence and community persistence over
time.

3 RARE CATEGORY EXPLOITATION

In the previous section, we introduced the current literature on rare category exploration, a prob-
lem that aims to identify at least one example from each minority class. A follow-up to rare cat-
egory exploration, rare category exploitation aims to learn from the identified examples and cap-
ture all the rare examples in a given dataset. In Figure 7, we present an example of rare category
exploitation on a synthetic dataset with one majority class and four minority classes. The key
observations are as follows: (1) the distribution of the majority class is smooth and (2) the sup-
port regions of the four minority classes are compact. That is, instances in each minority class
are self-similar and form a compact representation. In the past decades, the question of how to

explore the compactness of rare categories has attracted considerable interest from the data mining
and machine learning communities. In this section, we delve into the problem of rare category
exploitation under two scenarios: (1) homogeneous data and (2) heterogeneous data. Whereas
in the former setting, data are collected from the same source and represented in the same for-
mat in the latter setting, we aim to capture rare examples in the presence of data and task
heterogeneity.

3.1 Homogeneous Rare Category Exploitation
Formally, we let X and Y denote the sample space and label space, respectively. We are given a
dataset D = {Dl , Du }, where Dl = {(xi )}Nl
i=1 consists of Nl obtained annotated samples, Du =
{(xj )}Nu
j=1 denotes Nu unlabeled examples, and xi , xj ∈ X, yi ∈ Y. It is often the case that, due to
the (C1) rarity and label (C2) scarcity challenges, annotated data Nl are scarce. In rare category
exploitation, our goal is to produce a prediction function f (·) : X → Y by learning from Dl
and to accurately characterize unknown rare category examples in Du . Given this, we present
the following definition of rare category exploitation in the homogeneous setting. In this problem
setting, we mainly study (C1) rarity, (C2) label scarcity, (C3) non-separability, and (C5) dynamics
in RCA.

Problem 2. Homogeneous Rare Category Exploitation.

beled examples Du = {(xj )}Nu
j=1.
Find: (i) a prediction function f (·) to characterize rare category examples, (ii) a set of unlabeled
examples that are likely coming from the rare categories.

We categorize the current approaches to homogeneous rare category exploitation as either
global or local. The first category aims to capture the global data distribution for characterizing
rare categories, whereas the second category focuses on exploring rare categories within a single
or a few local regions (e.g., the neighborhood of the identified rare category examples).

3.1.1 Global Approaches. This category of approaches exploits both the labeled and unlabeled
examples to learn the class-membership distribution. Essentially, these methods transform the
rare category exploitation problem into a classification problem with highly skewed data distribu-
tion. However, unlike the well-studied imbalanced classification problem that aims to maximize

the overall classification accuracy (majority classes and minority classes), rare category exploita-
tion emphasizes learning and characterizing the minority classes. Early rare category exploitation
work addresses the (C1) rarity and (C3) non-separability challenges. One representative approach
is hyper-ball-based rare category exploitation [54, 55]. The key idea behind approaches is to for-
mulate rare category exploitation as an optimization problem: minimizing the radius R of the
hyper-ball that well encloses the rare categories. The general objective function for the binary
case (i.e., one majority class and one minority class) can be written as follows.

where R denotes the radius of the hyper-ball, c denotes the center of the hyper-ball, Dmaj
denotes
the set of labeled majority class examples, and Dmin
denotes the set of labeled minority class
examples. Moreover, to ensure the compactness of the hyper-ball, the authors introduce three
constraints on the optimization problem: (1) the labeled examples from the majority classes should
be outside of the hyper-ball; (2) the labeled examples from the minority class should be inside of
the hyper-ball; and (3) the hyper-ball should enclose as many unlabeled examples as possible. To
tackle the non-separability challenges, RACH [54] provides a relaxed solution of Equation (11) by
introducing slack variables to allow the miss-classified instances and then converting the problem
into a convex optimization problem. The relaxed problem can be easily solved in its dual form via
the projected subgradient method. Following He et al. [54], He et al. [55] introduces a kernelized
rare category exploitation algorithm that, generalizes RACH to model complex shapes of the target
rare categories’ support regions by projecting to the high-dimensional feature space induced by
kernels. The kernel method provides more flexibility when characterizing complex rare categories
in real-world applications.

Several more recent studies consider the problem of rare category exploitation in the presence
of (C2) scarce and noisy labels. Haque et al. [46], study the problem of novel class classification on
data streams. Instead of relying on redundant human-annotated labels or prior knowledge, they
propose a semi-supervised framework to track the confidence changes of classifiers in order to
detect the novel concept drifts and thus identify the novel classes. Zhou et al. [166] propose a bi-
level learning mechanism (shown in Figure 8) in which, a teacher model (i.e., curriculum learning
scheme) gradually augments the training set with pseudo labels, and the student model (i.e., rare
category characterization) returns the prediction results together with the prediction confidence
to the teacher model. In general, the teacher model and the student model are trained in a mutu-
ally beneficial way, enabling the model to achieve better prediction accuracy in both rarity and
label scarcity. Any real-world applications (e.g., video classification [162]), in addition featuring
label scarcity, come with complex data and noisy labels, which require machine learning models
to be trained with only weak supervision [172]. Zhong et al. [162] propose a GCN to clean the
noisy labels. The GCN-based label noise cleaner is designed to provide supervisory signals from
high-confidence snippets to low-confidence snippets, such that the classifier can be trained with
“clean” supervision. Xi et al. [144] study the problem of online transaction fraud detection. To han-
dle the noisy and complex user behavior information, they develop the dual importance-aware
factorization machine (DIFM) that captures field value variations and field interactions simulta-
neously to support online transaction fraud detection. Lin et al. [82] propose a multi-resolution rare
category exploitation approach to identify instances of online credit payment frauds at different

granularities. Wu et al. [143] study rare category exploitation under various data contamination,
by proposing an information-theoretic bound of performance degradation in terms of the data
contamination ratio.

3.1.2 Local Approaches. The local algorithms are also referred to as seeded or targeted algo-
rithms [56, 112, 151, 170]. This category of approaches essentially tackles rare category exploita-
tion as a local clustering problem. The key idea is to treat the labeled examples as seeds and return a
compact cluster near the seed examples without exploring the whole dataset. Azmandian et al. [16]
present a local kernel density ratio feature selection framework that seeks a salient feature sub-
space in which the normal data points form a high-density region and the rare examples form
a low-density region. In the learned subspace, the rare examples stand out and are easily distin-
guished by detection algorithms. Spielman and Teng [124], present a design of a local clustering
algorithm for massive graphs. The local algorithm is able to find a compact local cluster near a
seed example and the running time is near-linear with respect to the size of the returned cluster.
Andersen et al. [11], derive a mixing result for PageRank and propose a fast approximation method
to compute PageRank vectors. Using this method, the authors develop an improved local graph
partitioning algorithm that enables polylogarithmic time complexity with respect to the number
of edges in the given graph. Pang et al. [107] propose a local and interactive rare event detec-
tion algorithm, that leverages the feedback from an anomaly-biased simulation environment and
continuously updates the learned abnormality to novel rare categories.

Although the conventional local clustering algorithms are primarily designed for low-order
connectivity patterns (e.g., edge in Table 1), many applications exhibit high-order connectivity
patterns (e.g., star in Table 1). For example, the loop-shaped structure plays a significant role in de-
tecting communities in user-item networks [170]; a cluster of star-shaped structures often serves
a red flag indicating potential instances of synthetic ID fraud in the personal identifiable in-
formation (PII) networks [102]. To account for the crucial high-order connectivity patterns in
real-world systems, Zhou et al. [170] and Yin et al. [152] offer innovative studies of the problem of
local high-order graph clustering. In particular, the authors introduce the notion of high-order con-
ductance and the high-order diffusion kernel with the high-order Markov chain as the underlying
model, which allows end-users to model various types of high-order structures. Moreover, they
generalize the well-known local clustering algorithms [11, 124] to the high-order setting and pro-
vide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithms. Many
recent studies study the high-order connectivity patterns in more complicated scenarios, such
as modeling evolving high-order structures on fine-grained temporal networks [165], capturing

3.2 Heterogeneous Rare Category Exploitation
In the era of big data, many application domains exhibit multiple types of heterogeneity, including
data heterogeneity that originates from multiple information sources and task heterogeneity that
originates from multiple application domains. In this subsection, we organize the existing work in
the context of data heterogeneity and task heterogeneity.

3.2.1 Data heterogeneity. Learning from data heterogeneity is often referred to as multi-view
learning, as the data are collected from different sources, enabling multiple views. In the data
heterogeneity setting, rare category exploitation becomes even more challenging than in the data
homogeneity setting due to the existence of multiple views. It is crucial to leverage multiple views
and identify the relevant features for distinguishing between the majority and minority classes.
With the aim of addressing (C1) rarity, (C2) label scarcity, and (C4) data heterogeneity in rare
category analysis, we formally define the problem as follows:

Problem 3. Multi-View Rare Category Exploitation.
Given: (i) a dataset D collected from V views; (ii) a small set of labeled examples Dl = {(xi )}Nl
i=1.
Find: (i) a prediction function f (·) to characterize rare category examples, (ii) a set of unlabeled
examples that are likely coming from the rare categories.

A pivotal step in addressing Problem 5 is to leverage view consistency and learn a unified rep-
resentation to improve the performance of rare category exploitation. In the past decades, re-
searchers have proposed extensive multi-view learning frameworks [9, 40, 63, 64, 78, 79, 79, 91,
122, 157, 160] for anomaly detection that could potentially solve Problem 5. However, these meth-
ods are mostly unsupervised and/or based on some heuristic functions, which means the methods
might not well capture the characteristics of rare categories. MUVIR [163] is one of the principled
efforts that has been proposed to address Problem 5. MUVIR provides a generic rare category de-
tection solution that is able to integrate the existing single-view rare category exploitation models
in order to compute the overall posterior probability of each example. The key idea is to exploit the
relationship among multiple views and estimate the overall posterior probability of examples com-
ing from rare categories given data from multiple views. In particular, given data with multi-view
features, one can train V distinct rare category exploitation models upon V views and compute
view-specific posterior probability P (y = rare category|xv ) with respect to the vth view. The
authors propose the following theorem to effectively integrate view-specific posterior probability
P (y = rare category|xv ) in a model-agnostic way:

where the marginal probabilities P (x) and P (xv ) can be estimated via kernel density, and d is a non-
negative parameter that balances the importance of the term related to the marginal probabilities.
A modified version of MUVIR has been proposed for handling problems when the exact priors of mi-
nority classes are unknown. In the past few years, researchers have explored many high-impact ap-
plications of rare category exploitation that can be formulated as multi-view rare category exploita-
tion problems. Among them, Lee et al. [75] propose an attention-based visual question-answering
network to jointly model the input images and corpora and identify system errors or abnormal
events; Chen et al. [29] study the problem of multi-modal video anomaly detection, proposing a
bi-directional predictive network to regularize the prediction task from pixel-wise, cross-modal,
and temporal-sequence levels; and Shen et al. [123] propose an anomaly segmentation network
for localizing defective areas in large-scale industrial manufacturing environments.

Another group of approaches to multi-view rare category exploitation consist of the semi-
supervised classification models. For example, Nie et al. [104] propose a multi-view framework
with adaptive neighborhood learning. The framework integrates multi-view clustering and semi-
supervised classification, which allows learning attention for each view automatically. Zhang
et al. [156] develop a multi-view rare category exploitation framework for Alzheimer’s disease di-
agnosis. They propose a multi-layer multi-view framework that automatically constructs a shared
latent representation across multiple views and learns the mapping functions from the multi-view
features to the prediction labels. Wang and Lan [138] assume the multiple views of the majority
class examples are drawn from a unique distribution with different projection functions. Given
this assumption, the authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that computes the outlierness
of unlabeled samples and thus identifies rare examples.

3.2.2 Task heterogeneity. This subsection provides an overview of the rare category exploita-
tion algorithms that have been proposed in the context of task heterogeneity. Formally speaking, in
the presence of multiple tasks, we are given a dataset D = {D1∪. . .∪DS } that comes from S applica-
tions domains, and a small set of labeled examples from each task Ds
l denotes
l
the number of labeled examples in Ds . Our goal is to capture the multimodalities from different
tasks and domains and learn a prediction model to accurately characterize the rare categories from
different tasks and domains. The problem, which aims to address (C1) rarity, (C2) label scarcity,
(C3) non-separability, and (C5) dynamics in rare category analysis, is commonly defined as follows:

123:19

The past decades have produced much literature studying Problem 4. This literature can be
categorized in one of two ways based on its objectives. The first category aims to learn a mixture
of prediction functions that maximize the overall accuracy across all tasks. For example, Yang et al.
[146] study the problem of rare category exploitation in the presence of multiple tasks and multiple
views by proposing a joint optimization framework called M 2LI D. The authors start from a metric
called border degree that is used to capture the sharp changes in density near the boundary of rare
categories in the feature space:

BorderDegree(x) = Hub(x) − Authority(x)

(14)

where Hub(x) and Authority(x) indicate the hub value and authority value [70] of example x,
correspondingly. Intuitively, the larger the border degree is, the higher the probability that x be-
longs to the rare category. To model task relatedness and view consistency, they then formulate
the problem by requiring (1) task-specific learners to behave similarly on the features, (2) view-
based learners to behave similarly on the examples, and (3) the border-degree to be negatively
correlated with the prediction confidence score. Finally, to solve the optimization problem, they
develop a block-coordinate-descent-based method to iteratively update the boundary character-
istics of rare categories and multiple classification functions for different tasks. [62] propose a
multimodel learning algorithm that is based on a mixture of sparse Gaussian graphical models.
[161] aims to tackle the Problem 4 in the presence of data scarcity and adversarial attacks. The
authors propose a federated learning framework that performs multiple tasks simultaneously.

The second category is also referred to as transferable rare category exploitation. Instead of
learning an optimal predictor for all tasks, transferable rare category exploitation heavily em-
phasizes the target tasks. Some typical works includes [8], [12], [72], [129], and [136]. In Appel
et al. [12], the authors systematically evaluate the performance of anomaly detection frameworks
using two types of transfer representation learning paradigms: (1) transfer learning from pre-
trained networks, and (2) transfer learning from auxiliary tasks. Kumagai et al. [72] develop an
autoencoder framework that learns the domain-specific latent vectors and thus improves the per-
formance in detecting rare examples. Unlike most transfer learning models that aim to learn the
transferable representation for the target domain, the work of Vercruyssen et al. [136] proposes
to select a subset of labeled and relevant examples from the source domain to augment the tar-
get tasks. The aforementioned methods all assume the target domains are related to the source
domains. However, there is a more challenging scenario: the so-called out-of-distribution rare cat-
egory exploitation, wherein the test data are unseen or from shifted distributions. To handle the
out-of-distribution scenarios, Morteza and Li [98] propose an analytical framework with provable
guarantees to characterize and understand out-of-distribution detection in open-world applica-
tions. Sun and Wang [128] propose an adaptive in-out-aware learning framework to jointly model
the mixed in-distribution and out-of-distribution data samples. Acharya et al. [2] propose a graph
context reasoning network for out-of-distribution object detection by constructing a representa-
tion graph and a context graph from the input image.

4 UNDERSTANDING RARE CATEGORIES
Although they have been tremendously successful in exploring and exploiting rare category ex-
amples, many advanced methods, especially deep learning models, often remain black-box in na-
ture. This poses a challenge to their application in industries that have to follow highly regu-
lated processes. In these industries, prediction models must be interpretable and the output re-
sults are required to meet compliance standards. Therefore, a natural research question is how to
make existing models transparent to the end-user by identifying the right context (e.g., key fac-
tors, representative entities, critical timestamps). In this section, we systematically discuss how to

understand rare category patterns from the following two directions: (1) rare category represen-
tation and (2) rare category interpretation. The first direction aims to diagnose from the data per-
spective (i.e., How is the data distributed? Which piece of information is most valuable for a given
task?), while the second direction aims to diagnose from the model perspective (i.e., Why does the
model make a certain prediction on a particular piece of information?).

4.1 Rare Category Representation
In this task, we aim to learn a rare-category-oriented embedding representation such that the
rare examples (e.g., security threats) are well separated from the majority classes (e.g., normal
activities). Figure 9 presents a typical example of rare category representation learning wherein
the majority class and the minority class are overlapped together in the original features space but
become separated in the learned embedding space. Formally speaking, the problem can be defined
as follows:

Problem 5. Rare Category Representation.
Given: (i) a dataset D that consists of n samples; (ii) a small set of labeled examples Dl = {(xi )}Nl
i=1;
(iii) the user-defined embedding dimension d.
Find: (i) a rare category representation model д(·); (ii) a d-dimensional embedding representation
E ∈ Rn×d that well preserves the underlying distribution of rare categories.

In the past decade, extensive work has been done to develop representation learning methods to
learn the underlying distribution of the rare category patterns. The key idea behind these methods
is to track the “footprints” of rare categories via external information (e.g., supervision from ora-
cles) or prior knowledge (e.g., features indicating local density changes [52, 147]) and then leverage
this information to regularize the representation learning models to extract low-dimensional and
salient embedding for rare category analysis. For instance, Akoglu and Falioutsos [5] propose a
set of egonet features (e.g., weighted and unweighted in- and out-degree, number of neighbors,
number of triangles) from each snapshot of the graph sequence to model the “behavior” of each
node. These features are effective in spotting rare category examples. Manzoor et al. [90] aim to
spot anomalous patterns in a stream of heterogeneous graphs containing different types of nodes
and edges by proposing a clustering-based anomaly detection approach that can simultaneously
address the heterogeneity and streaming nature of the input data. In particular, Manzoor et al. in-
troduce a novel embedding mechanism that can encode the heterogeneous streaming graph into
a vector representation that is then used to perform clustering and identify anomalous patterns.

a highly skewed class distribution by learning a deep representation such that rare categories
are easily separable from the majority class by contemporary classification methods. In particu-
lar, this article first proposes to learn the data representation by maintaining both inter-cluster
and inter-class margins that reduce the class imbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood.
The proposed framework is built based on a Convolutional neural network (CNN) framework
through a quintuplet sampling scheme and the associated triple-header hinge loss.

More recently, due to the notable success of network-embedding approaches, various network-
embedding-based approaches have been proposed for rare category analysis. For example,
SPARC [166] is one of the first rare-category-oriented network embedding frameworks. SPARC
aims to learn a salient representation to characterize rare category examples. Inspired by the family
of curriculum learning that simulates the cognitive mechanisms of human beings, SPARC gradu-
ally selects the key network contextual information and learns the rare-category-oriented network
representation by shifting from the “easy” concept to the “difficult” concept. The results show that
(1) SPARC enables users to visualize the network layout in a salient embedding space, where the
majority classes and minority classes are well separated; and (2) SPARC is able to identify valu-
able contextual information that provides interpretation and guidance in the task of rare category
characterization. Here we compare SPARC with three state-of-the-art network embedding algo-
rithms, including two unsupervised methods, i.e., DeepWalk [111] and LINE [130], and one semi-
supervised method, i.e., PLANETOID [148]. We first map the given network to a 129-dimensional
space with different embedding methods. Then, we employ the nonlinear dimensionality reduction
method, i.e., t-SNE [88], to encode examples in a two-dimensional space for better visualization,
as shown in Figure 10. We observe that the rare examples are better clustered using the proposed
method than any of the baseline methods.

Following SPARC, Wu et al. [142] propose a biased random walk model named VDRW for learn-
ing imbalanced network representation. VDRW is designed to dynamically adjust the transition

probability matrix each time a node is visited by the random particle. Via VDRW, Wu et al. propose
a pair of sampling strategies, i.e., context sampling and balanced-bath sampling, to learn network
representation using skip-gram model [94]. NetWalk [155] is developed for rare event detection by
learning the network representations, which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves.
NetWalk first extracts the dynamic network context and encodes the vertices of the dynamic net-
work to a low-dimensional representation. Then, a clustering-based scheme is employed to incre-
mentally and dynamically track the malicious patterns in the dynamic networks. Deng et al. [34]
propose a GCN-based framework for predicting future events by capturing contextual information
from the raw data. The proposed framework first extracts graph representations of the events doc-
uments and, then learns to predict the occurrence of future events and identify events of interest
(e.g., anomaly patterns).

4.2 Rare Category Interpretation
Interpretability in machine learning models plays a crucial role in many high-impact domains and
rare category analysis. In this task, we aim to characterize the rare categories with a predictive
model and interpret the output from this model by providing relevant clues, such as connectivity
patterns, data sources, features, and timestamps from time-series data. We define the problem
setting as follows:

Problem 6. Rare Category Interpretation.
Given: (i) a dataset D that consists of n samples, (ii) a rare category analysis model f (·).
Find: interpretation over the output from f (·) on D.

Despite the rich literature in the context of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) [15, 31,
44, 61, 95, 96, 131], interpreting rare category analysis models remains challenging for the follow-
ing reasons: (1) rare category analysis models are naturally “biased” (i.e., focusing on minority

patterns instead of the overall data distribution), (2) rare category analysis model f (·) is
often trained with scarcity labels, and (3) the learning process of rare category analysis
model f (·) may frequently involve oracles and operate in a human-in-the-loop fashion (see
Figure 5 for rare category exploration). Simply replacing f (·) with a conventional interpretable
machine learning models may deteriorate the prediction performance by providing misleading
characterizations or injecting additional bias [74].

There have been a few attempts in the visualization domain to address Problem 6 given the
aforementioned challenges. For example, RCLens [81] is an interactive visual analytic system that is
designed to explore and identify rare category examples with the guidance of end-users. Figure 11
presents the user interface of RCLens, which actively visualizes and interprets the three learning
phases of rare category analysis models to end-users. In the data exploration phase (shown in
subfigure a), the system conducts a personalized visualization of the data via a data querying and
filtering mechanism; in the feature selection phase (shown in subfigure a), the system provides
relevant clues and statistics (e.g., correlations of features) for end-users to investigate the feature
dimensions; and in the rare category analysis model (shown in subfigure c), the system visualizes
the identified rare categories to end-users and then refines the predictions by leveraging the users’
feedback.

Pan et al. [105] proposes a visual analytic system named RCAnalyzer for studying rare cate-
gory patterns in dynamic systems. The user interface of RCAnalyzer is shown in Figure 12, which
includes (a) the timeline view showing an overview of the given dynamic networks; (b) the ma-
trices view showing the neighborhood contextual information of each node; (c) the example view
showing the feature distribution of rare patterns; and (d) the label result view showing the history

analysis models, the system is able to actively visualize each identified rare example in context (e.g.,

prediction results.

5 DATASETS AND REPRESENTATIVE METHODS

This section summarizes the popular evaluation datasets and representative algorithms across dif-
ferent data types and downstream tasks.

5.1 Datasets
Although rare categories are prevalent across various domains (e.g., finance), collecting and an-
notating rare examples is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive (e.g., annotating money
laundering activities). Early studies (e.g., [48, 50, 52, 53, 109]) evaluate their models on synthetic
or semi-synthetic datasets that are either generated from a pre-defined data distribution or ma-
nipulated from public benchmark datasets. However, evaluations performed on synthetic or semi-
synthetic datasets may not reflect the performance of rare category analysis models in real-world
applications. To promote the further development of rare category analysis, Table 2 summarizes
some public benchmark datasets, whose data range from tabular data to graph-structured data,
from static data to dynamic data.

5.2 Representative Methods

Comparison evaluation with representative algorithms serves a pivotal role in the development
of machine learning algorithms. In Table 3, we enumerate and summarize 25 representative rare
category analysis algorithms w.r.t. data type (i.e., tabular data, time-series data, graph data) and
downstream task (i.e., exploration, exploitation, representation, and visualization). Since the meth-
ods in Table 3 have been developed for diverse tasks and datasets, we are unable to provide
a meta-analysis of their performance in a unified setting. Instead, to provide insight and an
in-depth understanding of the methods, we summarize our major observations as follows: (i)
most methods are designed in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting, (ii) sampling-based
methods [135, 163] and anomaly-detection-based methods [132, 158] are still the mainstream

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Departing from the previous surveys, this article presented a comprehensive pipeline of recent ad-
vances in rare category analysis. We started from the de-novo step without any label information
and surveyed rare category exploration techniques in the setting of homogeneous data and het-
erogeneous data. Then, we reviewed rare category exploitation methods that aim to characterize
a compact representation of the minority classes in order to discover all the rare examples with
high accuracy. Finally, we discussed the problem of rare category explanation, and in particular,
how to learn a salient representation of rare categories and interpret the prediction results. De-
spite the significant developments in rare category analysis, there remain some exciting research
opportunities

• Rare Category Generation. To meet the dramatically increasing demand for machine learning
systems as service providers (e.g., social networking, online advertising, data security), a mas-
sive amount of data has been generated and collected from a variety of domains. However,
the collected rare data are often noisy, sparse, few-shot annotated, and evolving over time.
Directly training machine learning models from the raw data would introduce inevitable

model bias and largely degrade the model performance in downstream applications (e.g.,
rare category characterization, rare category explanation). Moreover, the ever-increasing
size of data, together with the difficulty of releasing and sharing them, has made data gener-
ation a fundamental problem that is key for many high-impact applications, including fraud
detection, recommendation, and data security, among others. Hence, it is critical to develop
deep generative models that enable scalable modeling of real data to extract key contextual
information, distill knowledge, and generate plausible patterns for data augmentation in rare
category analysis.

• Long-Tail Category Analysis. In the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable suc-
cess in various learning tasks (e.g., image classification, speech recognition, link prediction)
through the training of “big models” on “big data.” However, unlike these well-studied tasks
(e.g., image classification over domestic cats and wild cats) with rich training data, the vast
majority of real-world entities and patterns (e.g., identification of honest employees and
malicious insiders in a large institution) are under explored and lack the observational and
annotated data that often correspond to the “long-tail” categories. Unlike existing works
on rare category analysis that focus on one or a few rare categories, here we face a massive
number of underrepresented categories from a “long-tail” distribution. Moreover, the current
machine learning systems are mostly tailored to specific learning scenarios, prevent them
from delivering on their promises in detecting the targets of interest in the presence of distri-
bution changes (e.g., dynamic systems). Two fundamental research questions thus emerge:
(Q1) How can we comprehend such massive “long-tail” categories given the inherent paucity of
observational and annotated data? (Q2) How can we capture the targets of interest (e.g., rare
category examples) given a novel data distribution?

• Robust Rare Category Analysis. Robust rare category analysis is another fundamental yet
quite open research problem that is attracting a surge of attention from many high-impact
domains (e.g., spam detection, financial fraud, system diagnosis). For example, in financial
fraud detection: How can we measure entity sensitivity, algorithmic robustness, task hardness,
and model generalization, given a prediction model? How can we achieve operational robust-
ness and adversarial robustness in the presence of the external disturbances (e.g., noise, miss-
ing values, outliers, adversarial attacks)? Despite the extensive work on adversarial machine
learning, the vast majority of the previous studies assume a balanced data distribution while
neglecting realistic cases in which the data are highly skewed, and the targets of interest are
underrepresented. Compared to conventional machine learning tools, rare category analysis
models are more sensitive and vulnerable in the presence of adversarial attacks due to the
rarity, non-separability, and label scarcity of rare category examples.

• Human–AI Collaborative Rare Category Analysis. Many industries follow highly regulated
processes that require rare category analysis models to be interpretable and human experts
to be involved in the prediction loop. The human-in-the-loop fashion [24, 52] enables rare
category analysis models to leverage human intelligence to alleviate the label scarcity issue
and improve the prediction performance in high-stake applications, such as failure predic-
tion in safety-critical systems and rare disease diagnosis in health care. However, as hu-
man intelligence is naturally a black box to AI models, a fundamental research question
remains nascent: How can we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism of
human intelligence, thus enabling unimpeded knowledge transfer between human intelligence
and AI? A promising but challenging research direction lies in how to build an integrated
and interactive system for accurate and trustworthy human–AI collaborative rare category
analysis.

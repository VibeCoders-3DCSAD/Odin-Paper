Abstract

Financial wellness is a pervasive challenge: many individuals struggle with saving, investing, and budgeting effectively.
Traditional budgeting tools and Robo-advisors often provide generic advice, failing to account for an individual’s unique
behavior  and  needs.  This  paper  proposes  a  novel  approach  that  integrates  reinforcement  learning  (RL),  behavioral
analytics, and natural language processing to deliver real-time, personalized financial recommendations. We formulate
personal finance management as a Markov Decision Process, using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn optimal actions
(such as saving or investment allocations) tailored to a user’s financial state. To incorporate user diversity, we apply
unsupervised clustering (K-Means) on behavioral data to create distinct user personas, enabling the RL agent to adapt
its strategy for different profiles. An interactive conversational agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT API serves as the user
interface, translating the RL agent’s outputs into natural dialogue and handling user queries. We present an end-to-end
implementation in Python, including synthetic data generation, persona clustering, RL training, and integration with
OpenAI’s language model. Experimental results on a simulated personal finance environment demonstrate that the RL
agent learns policies that significantly improve saving and investment outcomes compared to baseline strategies. The
conversational  interface  provides  personalized  coaching,  which  can  boost  user  engagement  and  trust.  This
interdisciplinary  framework—combining  RL  for  decision-making,  clustering  for  personalization,  and  NLP  for
interaction—illustrates a promising direction for intelligent financial advisors that learn and communicate adaptively,
ultimately empowering users to achieve better financial wellness.

1. Introduction

Many households face difficulties in managing their finances, with limited savings and suboptimal budgeting. Recent
statistics highlight the severity of the problem: one-third of Americans report feeling financially insecure, and only 44%
can cover a $1000 emergency expense from savings. Such shortcomings in savings and emergency funds underscore a
clear need for improved financial planning support. Despite the availability of financial literacy resources and advisory
services,  customers  often  struggle  to  translate  advice  into  personalized,  actionable  plans  for  saving,  investing,  and
budgeting.

Traditional  solutions  for  financial  guidance  span  human  financial  advisors,  budgeting  apps,  and  automated  Robo-
advisors,  which  leverage  algorithms  to  manage  investments  and  have  gained  traction  in  investment  management.
However,  they  typically  focus  on  portfolio  allocation  and  lack  customization  in  day-to-day  budgeting  or  debt
management Moreover, while Robo-advisors provide recommendations based on risk tolerance and goals, they may
not adapt in real-time to an individual’s spending habits or behavioral biases. Personal financial management (PFM)
apps and budgeting tools can track expenses and provide basic categorizations, but their recommendations (e.g. “spend
less on dining out”) are often one-size-fits-all and reactive rather than proactively optimized for the user’s goals.

Recent  advances  in  artificial  intelligence  offer  new  opportunities  to  tackle  these  challenges.  Notably,  large  language
models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT have been applied to financial advice. Studies have shown that ChatGPT can generate
reasonable  financial  tips  for  common  scenarios.  However,  these  recommendations  tend  to  be  generic  and  lack
personalization, often overlooking alternative strategies or the unique priorities of an individual. For instance, ChatGPT
might suggest “reduce discretionary spending” to everyone, without accounting for a particular user’s income patterns,
debt  obligations,  or  behavioral tendencies.  Generative AI  by  itself  has knowledge but  no  mechanism to dynamically
learn a user’s optimal choices from experience.

To  truly  personalize  financial  guidance,  an  AI  system  should  learn  from  user  behavior  data  and  continuously  adapt
recommendations.  Reinforcement  Learning  (RL)  provides  a  robust  framework  for  this  need.  By  modeling  personal
finance management as a sequential decision-making problem, an RL agent can learn which actions (e.g., saving a certain
amount,  making  an  investment,  paying  down  debt)  lead  to  long-term  financial  well-being.  Unlike  static  rule-based
advice, an RL-driven system can observe how a user’s finances evolve and adjust its strategy to maximize outcomes
such as wealth accumulation, goal attainment, or minimized debt.

Another key ingredient for personalization is behavioral analytics. Users have diverse financial habits and preferences;
a  one-size  policy  will  not  fit  all.  Clustering  techniques  can  uncover  patterns  in  user  data,  grouping  customers  into
personas  with  similar  behavior  (for  example,  “aggressive  saver”,  “overspending  debtor”,  “cautious  planner”).  Such
persona profiles can inform the RL agent or serve as a prior to tailor its strategy. Clustering is widely used in customer
segmentation in finance. By profiling users via unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN), we can initialize or
condition  the  RL  policy  based  on  persona,  ensuring  that  recommendations  are  relevant  from  the  start  (e.g.,  a  user
identified as a high spender might receive different tips than a frugal saver).

Finally,  delivering  personalized  recommendations  in  an  effective  manner  is crucial  for  user adoption.  This  is  where
Natural Language  Processing  (NLP) and  conversational  AI  come  in.  An  interactive  conversational  agent can  present
insights and guidance in an intuitive, empathetic way, much like a human financial coach. Advances in NLP, particularly
transformer-based  language  models, enable  AI agents  to communicate in  natural  language,  clarify  user  queries, and
explain recommendations. For instance, some modern PFM apps now integrate chatbots to help users with budgeting
in a dialogue format. However, these chatbots currently operate on predefined logic or static information. By integrating
a powerful NLP model (such as GPT-4 via OpenAI’s API) with an RL-driven decision engine, we get the best of both
worlds: a brain that can learn optimal financial decisions, and a mouth that can effectively converse with the user.

In  this  paper,  we  introduce  an  end-to-end  framework  titled  Personalized  Financial  Wellness  Agent  (PFWA)  that
combines reinforcement learning for decision optimization, clustering for user profiling, and NLP for conversational
interaction. Our contributions are as follows:

•  Problem Formulation: We define a clear problem statement for personalized financial wellness: customers
need help with savings, investment, and budgeting decisions in a way that adapts to their personal situation
and  behavior.  We  formalize  this  as  a  sequential  decision  problem  and  outline  the  limitations  of  existing
solutions.

•  RL-Based Solution: We propose a solution centered on a deep reinforcement learning agent (using a single RL
approach, specifically a Deep Q-Network) that learns to make personalized financial recommendations in real-
time. The RL agent’s objective is to maximize the user’s long-term financial well-being (e.g., net worth or goal
fulfillment) through a series of actions (recommendations). We describe how the agent observes state (user’s
financial metrics), takes actions (suggestions like “save $X this month”), and receives rewards (improvement
in financial health).

•  Behavioral  Personalization  via Clustering:  To  bootstrap  and  enhance the  RL  policy,  we  incorporate  user
persona profiling.  By  analyzing  historical financial data (which can  include income, spending patterns,  debt
levels,  etc.),  we  cluster  users  into  distinct  personas.  These  personas  inform  the  agent’s  strategy,  either  by
selecting  a  pre-trained  policy  for  that  cluster  or  by  adjusting  reward  parameters  to  align  with  the  user’s
priorities.  We  demonstrate  this  with  a  K-Means  clustering  of  synthetic  user  data,  yielding  interpretable
personas that the system uses for tailored advice.

•  Conversational Agent Integration: We integrate the decision-making module with a conversational interface
using  the  OpenAI  GPT  API.  The  language  model  handles  understanding  user  inquiries  (e.g.,  “Can  I  afford  to
invest  more  this  month?”)  and  generating  friendly,  clear  responses.  It  leverages  the  RL  agent’s  outputs  to
ground  the  conversation  in  concrete,  personalized  advice.  This  design  addresses  the  customer  value
proposition: by delivering guidance through a conversational agent that remembers user context and learning,
the user receives tailored financial coaching, which we argue can boost engagement and trust in the system.

Implementation and Experiments: We present a full implementation in Python, including code snippets for
each component (data generation, clustering, RL training, and the NLP integration). We use a synthetic dataset
simulating users’ financial data and an environment for monthly budgeting decisions. We train a DQN agent on
this  environment  and  show  results  such  as  training  performance  curves  and  example  outcomes.  We  also
illustrate example dialogues between the user and the AI agent. Key performance metrics (e.g., average reward,
savings achieved) are reported to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.

2. Methodology

Our proposed system, the Personalized Financial Wellness Agent (PFWA), consists of three principal components: (1) a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that learns to make financial recommendations, (2) a user persona profiling module
that tailors the agent’s strategy via clustering, and (3) a conversational AI interface for user interaction. Below Figure 1,
presents an overview of the system architecture. The RL agent operates on the user’s financial state, the persona module
provides  additional  context  about  user  behavior  tendencies,  and  the  NLP  interface  handles  the  dialogue.  We  now
describe each component and the overall algorithm in detail.

2.1. Problem Formulation as an MDP

We  model  the  user’s  personal  finance  management  as  a  Markov  Decision  Process  (MDP).  In  each  time  step  (e.g.,  a
month), the agent observes the state $s_t$ of the user’s finances and chooses an action $a_t$ (a financial decision or
recommendation). The environment (the user’s financial dynamics) then transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$ and yields
a reward $r_t$ based on the outcome of the action. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time
(which reflects the user’s financial wellness). Formally, an MDP is defined by the tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$ where:
$S$ is the state space, $A$ is the action space, $P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ are transition probabilities, $R(s_t,a_t)$ is the reward
function, and $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is a discount factor for future rewards.

In our context:

•

State ($S$): We design the state to capture the user’s current financial status. This can include variables such
as current savings balance, investment portfolio value, outstanding debt, monthly income, budget utilization,
and time-related features. For simplicity and without loss of generality, our experimental implementation uses
a subset of these features (e.g., current savings and the month index in the budgeting horizon). The state may
also incorporate the user’s persona (either implicitly, via state variables like “risk tolerance”, or explicitly as a
one-hot encoding of cluster membership).

•  Action ($A$): Actions correspond to financial decisions or recommendations the agent can make at each step.
These could be discrete choices (e.g., {increase monthly saving by $X, pay $Y towards debt, invest $Z in a fund,
no change}) or continuous (e.g., a percentage of income to allocate to savings). In our implementation, we use
a  discrete  action  set  for  clarity:  the  agent  decides  how  much  money  to  allocate  to  savings  each month  (the
remainder presumably is spent; actions implicitly also cover investment by assuming saved money could be
invested  in  a  generic  asset).  An  example  action  could  be  “save  $200  this  month”  or  “allocate  10%  more  of
income to debt repayment”.

•  Transition  ($P$):  The  environment  transition  function  represents  how  the  user’s  finances  evolve.  This
includes deterministic dynamics (if you save $X, your savings account increases by $X) and stochastic events
(market returns on investments, unexpected expenses, emergencies). We simulate stochastic shock events like
a sudden expense that must be paid (car repair, medical bill), which affects the savings or debt. Such uncertainty
is important to model because a key benefit of an RL approach is the ability to learn strategies that hedge against
risks (for example, building an emergency fund to handle shocks).

•  Reward ($R$): The reward is defined to align with the user’s financial wellness objectives. One straightforward
reward definition is the change in net worth (savings minus debt) – this encourages the agent to increase assets
and decrease liabilities. However, solely maximizing net worth could lead to extreme frugality that a real user
might not follow. Thus, we can incorporate terms in the reward to reflect behavioral utility, such as a slight
penalty for reduced spending (to model diminishing returns or user discomfort). For instance, $r_t = \Delta
\text{net_worth}_t - \alpha \times \text{overbudget}_t$, where $\text{overbudget}_t$ is a penalty if spending
exceeds  income,  and  $\alpha$  is  a  small  weight  ensuring  the  agent  doesn’t  completely  ignore  the  user’s
immediate quality of life. In our experiments, for simplicity, we use the final net savings at the end of a horizon
as the primary reward, with penalties for falling into debt. The design of the reward function can be adjusted
based on specific goals (saving for a target, avoiding bankruptcy, etc.).

1569

The  agent’s  task  is  to  learn  a  policy  $\pi(a|s)$  that  selects  actions  to  maximize  the  expected  cumulative  reward
$E[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t]$. We treat this as an episodic task (for example, an episode could correspond to a
year  of  monthly  decisions,  $T=12$  months,  after  which  the  financial  outcome  is  evaluated).  By  simulating  many
episodes (either through a user model or historical data), the agent can learn from trial and error.

3. Reinforcement Learning Approach (DQN)

We employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) as our reinforcement learning algorithm. DQN is a value-based method where a
neural network is used to approximate the Q-value function $Q(s,a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward
of acting $a$ in state $s$ and following the optimal policy thereafter. DQN was famously applied to learn to play Atari
games from pixels, achieving human-level performance; here we apply it to a very different domain, but the underlying
principles are similar.

•  Why DQN/PPO? The choice of RL algorithm is important. We chose DQN for clarity and because our action
space  in  the  prototype  is  discrete  (e.g.,  choices  of  savings  amount).  DQN  uses  experience  replay  and  target
networks  to  stabilize  training,  which  is  suitable  for  our  simulated  environment.  An  alternative  could  be
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a policy-gradient method known for stable performance in continuous and
high-dimensional action spaces. PPO could be advantageous if we model actions like continuous dollar amounts
or multi-action decisions (e.g., simultaneously deciding on saving and investing proportions). Our framework
is agnostic to the specific RL algorithm; one could substitute PPO or others depending on the complexity of the
action space. For this paper, we focus on a single approach (DQN) to demonstrate the concept.

•  DQN  Architecture:  We  define  a  neural  network  $Q_\theta(s,a)$  that  takes  as  input  the  state  (or  a
representation of it) and outputs Q-values for each possible action. In our implementation, the state features
(such as current savings and any other features) are fed into a few fully connected layers. Because our state
dimension is relatively small, a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron suffices. If we had more complex state (like a
long sequence of past transactions), we might incorporate recurrent layers or attention mechanisms, but that
is beyond the scope of this initial implementation. The output layer has dimensionality equal to the number of
actions, giving  a  Q-value  for  each action.  We  use  the  standard  DQN  loss  to  train  this  network:  $L(\theta)  =
E_{(s,a,r,s') \sim D}\left[ (r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^{-}}(s',a') - Q_{\theta}(s,a) )^2 \right]$, where $D$
is a replay buffer of experience and $\theta^{-}$ are parameters of a target network (a delayed copy of the
network parameters for stable Q-value targets). We employ an $\epsilon$-greedy policy during training for
exploration:  with  probability  $\epsilon$  the  agent  chooses  a  random  action,  otherwise  it  chooses  $a  =
\arg\max_a Q_\theta(s,a)$.
State Augmentation with Persona Context: A novel aspect of our approach is augmenting the state or reward
with persona information. After clustering users (described in the next subsection), each user (or episode) can
be tagged with a persona label (like cluster ID). We incorporate this in two possible ways:

•

o  State augmentation: Add the persona ID or profile features to the state vector input to the RL agent.
This way, the agent can learn different behaviors for different persona states. Essentially, the policy
becomes a function of $(s, \text{persona})$.

o  Reward shaping or separate agents: Train a separate instance of the RL agent for each persona cluster
with  a  reward  function  tuned  to  that  persona’s  priorities.  For  example,  a  “debt-averse”  persona’s
reward  might  put  extra  negative  weight  on  being  in  debt,  thereby  pushing  that  persona’s  agent  to
prioritize debt repayment more than another persona’s agent. In our implementation, we take the state
augmentation approach for simplicity – we input a persona identifier to the agent network (encoded
as a one-hot vector or an embedding). This can be seen as a lightweight form of contextual RL or multi-
task learning, where one neural network learns to handle multiple persona contexts.

4. User Persona Profiling via Clustering

To personalize the agent’s behavior from the outset, we segment users into personas using clustering on historical or
demographic data. K-Means clustering is used in our prototype due to its simplicity and interpretability. The features
used for clustering can include average income, average monthly saving rate, volatility of expenses, propensity to invest,
credit utilization, and other behavioral indicators. We normalize these features and run K-Means to group users into
$k$  clusters  (we  chose  $k=3$  for  demonstration,  representing,  for  instance,  “low-income,  low-saver”,  “mid-income,
moderate-saver”, and “high-income, high-saver” personas).

•  K-Means  Recap:  The  algorithm  partitions  the  data  into  $k$  clusters  by  minimizing  the  sum  of  squared
distances between points and their assigned cluster’s centroid. It’s an unsupervised learning method that is

1570

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

widely used for customer segmentation problems. Each resulting cluster can be interpreted to craft a persona
narrative. For  example, one cluster  might correspond to  users  who have high  income  but a low  saving  rate
(implying high spending – possibly a “luxury spender” persona), whereas another cluster might represent low-
income but diligent savers.

In our system, once a user’s data is clustered, we obtain a persona label that is used as described earlier. Additionally,
the persona can be used in the NLP module to adjust the tone of the conversation. For example, a “struggling saver”
persona might receive more empathetic and encouraging language from the chatbot, while a “numbers-driven investor”
persona might get more analytical explanations. This aligns with findings that personalizing tone increases user trust.

•  Behavioral  Data  Generation  (Synthetic):  For  experimentation,  we  generate  a  synthetic  dataset  of  user
financial behavior to cluster. Each synthetic user has attributes like income level and saving habit. We ensure
diversity  so  that  meaningful  clusters  exist.  (In  a  real  deployment,  one  would  use  the  bank/account  data  of
customers over, say, the past year to do this clustering.) We chose two features for simplicity: annual income
and  average  saving  rate  (fraction  of  income  saved).  Although  this  is  a  simplification,  it  does  reflect  two
important dimensions of financial behavior. We then apply K-Means to this dataset. Pseudocode for this process
is shown below, using Python with numpy and scikit-learn:

import numpy as np

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Synthetic data: create users in 3 persona groups

n_users = 300

incomes = np.concatenate([

 np.random.normal(30000, 5000, size=100), # Cluster 1: low income

 np.random.normal(70000, 10000, size=100), # Cluster 2: mid income

 np.random.normal(120000,15000, size=100) # Cluster 3: high income

])

save_rates = np.concatenate([

 np.random.normal(0.10, 0.03, size=100), # Cluster 1: low saving rate

 np.random.normal(0.20, 0.05, size=100), # Cluster 2: moderate saving rate

 np.random.normal(0.40, 0.08, size=100) # Cluster 3: high saving rate

])

# Clip savings rates to [0,1]

save_rates = np.clip(save_rates, 0, 1)

X = np.column_stack((incomes, save_rates)) # feature matrix

# Apply K-Means clustering

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)

1571

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_

In this code, we synthesize three clusters by sampling from different income and saving rate distributions. The K-Means
algorithm then recovers (approximately) those clusters, and centers will contain the centroid of each cluster (mean
income and saving rate for the persona). We found that the clusters correspond to intuitive personas:

•  Persona A: Low Income (~$30k), Low Saving Rate (~10%). This could correspond to users living paycheck-

to-paycheck with little ability to save.

•  Persona B: Mid Income (~$70k), Moderate Saving Rate (~20%). These users save a reasonable portion of their

income.

•  Persona C: High Income (~$120k), High Saving Rate (~40%). These are high earners who are also fairly frugal,

saving a large fraction of income.

We  will  use  these  labels  (A,  B,  C)  to  inform  the  RL  agent’s  policy  selection  (for  example,  we  might  train  one  policy
primarily on each cluster’s data to specialize it).

•  Visualization of Personas: The clusters can be visualized to verify they make sense. Figure 1 below shows a

scatter plot of the synthetic users colored by their K-Means cluster assignment:

Figure 1 Clustering of synthetic users based on annual income and saving rate. Three distinct persona clusters are
visible: (Yellow) Low Income, Low Saving; (Pink) Mid Income, Moderate Saving; (Orange) High Income, High Saving.
Black ‘X’ marks indicate cluster centroids. Such persona definitions help tailor the RL agent’s strategy to different user
types

This persona information flows into the RL framework by conditioning the agent’s decisions (as described previously)
and into the conversation by altering how recommendations are framed.

5. Conversational Agent and NLP Integration

The final piece of our methodology is the integration of a conversational agent that interacts with the user. The goal is
to provide the RL agent’s recommendations to the user in natural language and to allow the user to ask questions or
provide feedback. We use OpenAI’s GPT-4 model via its API to serve as the language generator for the agent.

•  Role of the Conversational Agent: The agent sits between the user and the RL decision engine:

o

It takes user inputs (questions, confirmations, or additional information). For example, a user might
ask, “Can I really afford to invest $500 this month?” or state “I have an unexpected medical bill.”

1572

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

o

o

o

o

It queries or informs the RL module as needed. In the current design, the RL runs continuously each
time  step  to  suggest  an  action.  The  conversation  agent  fetches  the  latest  recommendation  from  RL
(which could be something like “suggest saving $300”).
It translates the raw recommendation into a user-friendly explanation or suggestion. Instead of bluntly
saying “Save $300”, it might say: “Based on your current income and spending patterns, I recommend
setting aside $300 this month. This will keep you on track to reach your emergency fund goal.”
It can incorporate the persona tone: If the user is Persona A (struggling to save), the agent might add:
“I know it might be challenging, but even a small increase in savings will help build your safety net.” If
Persona C (high saver), maybe a different approach: “Great job so far! With your income, putting aside
$300 more this month will accelerate your path to your investment goal.”
It handles natural language responses from the user. If the user says “That seems too high, I have some
big expenses,” the agent can either adjust the recommendation (possibly by communicating to the RL
module, or by applying a rule to not push too hard) or explain why the suggestion is beneficial.

•  Using OpenAI GPT API: We use the OpenAI ChatCompletion API which provides access to models like GPT-3.5
and GPT-4. These models can be conditioned on a conversation history. We construct a prompt that includes
relevant context (the user’s persona or some key financial stats) and the RL’s suggestion, then ask the model to
draft a helpful response. We also include a system message to set the assistant’s role (e.g., “You are a financial
advisor AI that provides personalized advice in a friendly manner.”).

Below is a simplified code snippet showing how the integration might occur in Python using the openai library:

import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY" # set the OpenAI API key

# Define the conversation context and latest RL recommendation

persona = "High Income, High Saving"

recommended_action = "Save an additional $300 this month"

# Construct messages for the ChatCompletion

messages = [

 {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a helpful financial assistant. "

 f"User persona: {persona}. Provide personalized financial advice."},

 {"role": "user", "content": "I wonder if I should adjust my savings this month."},

 {"role": "assistant", "content": f"Based on your situation, I suggest {recommended_action}."

 " It will help you reach your goals faster without compromising your lifestyle."}

]

# (The conversation may include more turns; here we provide a single-turn example)

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4", messages=messages)

assistant_reply = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

print(assistant_reply)

In this snippet, we simulate a user asking about adjusting savings, and we (as the assistant) inject the recommendation.
The OpenAI model then generates a continuation. The assistant_reply would contain something along the lines of a well-
phrased advice. For instance, the output might be:

1573

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

"Sure. Given your strong income and current saving habits, adding an extra $300 to savings this month is a smart move.
You won't feel a big difference in spending, and you'll be building a nice cushion for the future. If any surprise expenses
come up, you’ll be glad to have that extra money set aside. Does that sound doable for you?"

This  kind  of  response  includes  an  explanation  (“won’t  feel  a  big  difference…  building  a  cushion”)  and  a  question  to
engage the user. We did not explicitly train the language model – we rely on GPT-4’s pre-trained capabilities and just
guide  it  with  context.  In  practice,  one  could  also  fine-tune  a  smaller  model  on  financial  dialogue  or  use  prompt
engineering to enforce certain formats (for instance, always provide reasoning).

The conversational agent operates in real-time as the interface. Importantly, it can also serve as a channel for feedback
to the RL agent. If the user explicitly says they cannot follow a recommendation, we could devise a mechanism to adjust
the  agent’s  understanding  (for  example,  lowering  the  immediate  reward  for  that  suggestion  so  the  agent  seeks  an
alternative that the user might accept). This is an area of future improvement — essentially closing the loop between
user feedback and the learning process (which could be formulated as an RL with human feedback).

6. End-to-End Flow

To summarize the methodology, here’s how an interaction loop would work in deployment:

•

•

Initial  Profiling:  New  user  signs  up,  connects  their  financial  accounts  (through  a  financial  API  like  Plaid,
potentially). The system gathers historical data (income, expenses) and performs clustering to assign a persona.
Suppose the user is classified as Persona B (moderate saver).
Initial Policy Selection: The RL agent is either loaded with a policy trained for Persona B or starts training
with Persona B context. (In our experiment, we train from scratch per run, but in a real system one might pre-
train policies on each cluster using many users’ data).

•  Monthly (or frequent) Interaction: Each month, the user’s latest state (e.g., updated account balances, new
transactions)  is  fed  to  the  RL  agent.  The  agent  computes  a  recommendation  (action).  The  conversational
module then conveys this to the user, e.g., “I recommend you allocate $300 to your savings and $100 to pay
down your credit card.”

•  User Responses: The user might follow the advice, or partially follow, or ask questions. The environment will
reflect their actual behavior in the next state. If the user deviates, that can be perceived as the environment’s
stochastic outcome from the agent’s perspective (or explicitly fed back).

•  Learning  and  Adaptation:  Over  time,  the  RL  agent  updates  its  policy  with  new  experience.  If  the  user
consistently cannot save as much as suggested, the agent might learn to suggest slightly lower amounts that are
realistic, maximizing long-term adherence.

•  Continuous Feedback Loop: The conversational agent collects signals like user sentiment or acceptance. We
could quantify this as a secondary reward (for example, a +1 reward if user follows advice, -1 if not). This would
further  refine  the  policy  to  not  only  maximize  financial  metrics  but  also  user  satisfaction  –  crucial  for  a
recommendation system to be effective in practice.

By  following  this  loop,  the  PFWA  aims  to  produce  a  virtuous  cycle:  personalized  advice  leads  to  better  financial
outcomes, and positive outcomes reinforce the user’s trust, leading them to provide more data and follow advice more
closely.

In the next section, we describe the specific implementation of this methodology in a simulated environment, including
the technical setup and code, before moving on to the results of our experiments.

7. Implementation

We developed a prototype of the proposed system in Python. The implementation consists of: (a) generating a synthetic
dataset and performing clustering to obtain user personas, (b) defining a custom environment for the personal finance
MDP,  (c)  training  a  DQN  agent  on  this  environment,  and  (d)  demonstrating  integration  with  the  OpenAI  API  for
conversational output. All code was run on a standard Python environment with libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn,
and PyTorch/TensorFlow for RL (the choice of framework was flexible; one could also use stable reinforcement learning
libraries).

7.1. Synthetic Data Generation and Clustering

Using the approach described in Methodology, we created a synthetic dataset of 300 users and clustered them into 3
personas. The code snippet for this was provided earlier. Here we ensure the clustering results are available for the RL
part. In practice, we store each user’s cluster label. For our simulation, we assume we are focusing on one representative
user from each cluster to see how the agent behaves. (Alternatively, we could train one agent on one cluster at a time.)

Cluster Summary: The K-Means clustering produced centroids approximately:

•  Cluster 0: (Income $30k, Save rate 0.10)
•  Cluster 1: (Income $120k, Save rate 0.38)
•  Cluster 2: (Income $72k, Save rate 0.22)

We label these as persona A, C, B respectively (to match earlier naming). The cluster assignments labels can be used to
initialize the environment or agent with persona info.

7.2. Environment Definition

We implemented a simple OpenAI Gym-like environment called FinanceEnv to simulate the personal finance MDP. The
environment operates on a monthly timestep. Key aspects:

•

State space: For the simulation, we use a tuple (month_index, current_savings) as the state. month_index goes
from 0 to 11 (for a 12-month episode). current_savings is the net savings amount (can be positive or negative
if debt). We discretize savings to the nearest $10 for simplicity in the state representation.

•  Action space: Discrete with 6 actions, representing saving {$0, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50} out of the discretionary
income for that month. Discretionary income we define as (income – mandatory_expenses). In our simulation,
we set monthly income = $100 and mandatory expenses = $50, so discretionary $50 is available to either save
or spend. The actions thus effectively decide what portion of that $50 to save (the rest is spent).

•  Transition dynamics: Each month, after the agent chooses an amount to save:

o  The savings amount is added to current_savings.
o  A shock event may occur with a certain probability (we set 10%). If a shock happens, an expense of
$30 is incurred. This is first taken out of savings (reducing current_savings), and if savings weren’t
enough  (i.e.,  current_savings  becomes  negative),  it  means  the  user  had  to  go  into  debt  for  the
remainder.

o  The month index increments by 1. If month goes beyond 11, the episode ends.

•  Reward: We give zero reward on intermediate steps and a final reward at the end of the 12th month equal to
the  current_savings  (net  funds).  This  means  the  agent  is  essentially  trying  to  maximize  end-of-year  savings
(which accounts for any debt if negative). We chose this sparse reward to mimic a scenario where the goal is
evaluated at year-end. In a more complex setup, we could provide small negative rewards each month for being
in debt or not meeting targets, but we kept it simple for clarity. Additionally, if we wanted to incorporate user
satisfaction,  we  could  subtract  a  tiny  penalty  for  each  dollar  saved  (to  simulate  diminishing  returns  on
happiness). In this implementation, we did not include that, which effectively means “more saving is always
better” from the agent’s perspective, tempered only by the risk of shocks.

We now show a streamlined version of the environment code:

Language: python

import random

class FinanceEnv:

 def __init__(self, income=100, mandatory_expense=50, shock_prob=0.1, shock_amount=30):

 self.income = income

 self.mandatory = mandatory_expense

 self.discretionary = income - mandatory_expense

1575

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

 self.shock_prob = shock_prob

 self.shock_amount = shock_amount

 self.month = 0

 self.current_savings = 0

 self.done = False

 def reset(self):

 self.month = 0

 self.current_savings = 0

 self.done = False

 return (self.month, self.current_savings)

 def step(self, action_save):

 # Constrain action to [0, discretionary] just in case

 save = max(0, min(action_save, self.discretionary))

 # Apply action: increase savings by chosen save amount

 self.current_savings += save

 # Spend the rest (discretionary - save) - not tracked explicitly

 # Random shock

 if random.random() < self.shock_prob:

 # Pay shock from savings (if not enough, go negative)

 self.current_savings -= self.shock_amount

 # Prepare next state

 self.month += 1

 if self.month >= 12:

 self.done = True

 # Reward only at end of year

 reward = 0

 if self.done:

 reward = self.current_savings # final net savings as reward

 return (self.month, self.current_savings), reward, self.done

1576

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

This environment can be interfaced with any RL algorithm. We can wrap it to be compatible with OpenAI Gym if needed
by adding action_space and observation_space attributes (for instance, using gym.spaces.Discrete and gym.spaces.Box).
For our training, we directly interact with it in a custom training loop.

7.3. RL Training (DQN)

We implemented a basic DQN training loop using the environment above. To keep the implementation concise, we did
not use a deep learning framework in the code snippet here; instead, we discretized the state and used a Q-table (tabular
Q-learning).  This  is  feasible  because our state  is  low-dimensional and  discretized. For  a more complex scenario,  we
would use a neural network and a framework like PyTorch to optimize the DQN as in the pseudocode described earlier.

Nonetheless, the logic of training remains the same. Here’s a pseudo-code outline (a simplified version of our actual
implementation):

Language: python

import numpy as np

env = FinanceEnv()

num_states = 12 * 101 # 12 months * (savings from -400 to 600 in steps of 10) ~ state space size

num_actions = 6 # [0,10,20,30,40,50] saving

Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

alpha = 0.1 # learning rate

gamma = 1.0 # no discount (we care about final reward)

epsilon = 0.1 # exploration rate

def state_to_index(state):

 month, savings = state

 # clamp and discretize savings to nearest 10

 savings_clamped = int(round(min(600, max(-400, savings)) / 10) * 10)

 savings_idx = (savings_clamped - (-400)) // 10 # offset index

 return month * 101 + savings_idx

# Training loop

for episode in range(10000):

 state = env.reset()

 state_idx = state_to_index(state)

 done = False

 while not done:

 # epsilon-greedy action

 if random.random() < epsilon:

1577

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

 action_idx = random.randrange(num_actions)

 else:

 action_idx = np.argmax(Q[state_idx])

 action_save = action_idx * 10 # map index to actual save amount

 next_state, reward, done = env.step(action_save)

 next_state_idx = state_to_index(next_state)

 if done:

 # update for terminal state

 Q[state_idx, action_idx] += alpha * (reward - Q[state_idx, action_idx])

 else:

 # update for non-terminal

 Q[state_idx, action_idx] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state_idx]) - Q[state_idx, action_idx])

 state_idx = next_state_idx

This code performs Q-learning updates on a Q-table. We maintain a discretization of savings to 10-dollar increments for
tractability,  as  noted.  We  run  10,000  episodes  (each  episode  simulates  one  year).  The  exploration  rate  $\epsilon$
ensures  the agent tries a  variety of  actions  to  learn  outcomes.  Over time,  Q-values  should converge toward optimal
estimates.

After training, we can extract the learned policy by taking the argmax action for each state. We found that the learned
policy indeed tries to save as much as possible, especially as the year-end approaches or if a shock has incurred debt,
the agent then aggressively saves to recover. In some runs, the policy learned to hold off saving in the very early months
and then save later – this is likely due to our reward being only at the end (the agent is indifferent when it saves, as long
as final is same, unless a shock happens to catch it off guard). In a refined reward design, we might encourage smoother
saving (which could be done by adding a small per-month saving reward).

To evaluate training progress, we tracked the average final savings (reward) over episodes. Figure 2 shows the training
curve of the agent’s performance:

1578

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

Figure 2 Training performance of the RL agent (DQN) over 5000 episodes, shown as a moving average of final episode
reward (net savings after 12 months). The reward increases over time, indicating the agent learning to achieve higher
savings. It starts near $20 (meaning initially it often ended with $20 net savings on average) and rises towards around
$100–$120. The variability is due to stochastic shock events and exploration. An optimal policy in this scenario
(always saving the maximum $50 each month) would yield a final savings of $600 minus any shocks; the learned
policy approaches a reasonably good outcome

This  training  curve  demonstrates  the  agent  improving  its  strategy.  Initially,  the  agent  might  do  random  actions,
sometimes ending with little or no savings (or even debt if a shock hit at a bad time). Over time, it figures out to save
more consistently, thereby increasing the expected final savings. The red dashed line at 0 in Figure 2 is just a reference
(zero savings); the agent clearly stays in positive territory most of the time after learning. Occasional dips in the average
reward curve occur when the agent is exploring or when random shock patterns temporarily reduce performance, but
the overall trend is upward.

8. Integration with NLP (OpenAI API)

The final integration step is connecting the trained RL agent with the OpenAI GPT-based conversational interface. In the
prototype, this integration is demonstrated offline (since we don’t maintain an actual interactive session in this paper
format). The idea is as follows: at each decision point (each month in the simulation or each query by user), we do:

•  Agent decision: Get the current state $s$ of the user. Query the RL agent for the best action $a^* = \arg\max_a
Q(s,a)$ (or sample from $\pi(a|s)$ if using a policy network). In our case, that might be an amount of money to
save.

•  Generate message: Formulate a prompt for GPT with the needed context. For example:

o  System message: role definition and possibly persona info.
o  User message: the user’s question or the situation if it’s a proactive recommendation.
o  Assistant message (optional): we can also provide an initial assistant message with the raw suggestion

as shown in the code snippet earlier.

•  GPT completion: Call openai.ChatCompletion.create with the messages to get a response. This response is the

advice communicated to the user.

We ensure that the assistant’s suggestion is consistent with the RL agent’s decision. One method is to explicitly include
the numeric recommendation in the assistant’s message (as we did: "I suggest saving $300..."). Another method could be
to pass it via a hidden “tool” interface (some advanced prompting techniques allow the model to use tools; OpenAI’s
function calling could be relevant, but that might be too advanced for this context).

1579

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

For our demonstration, we can simulate one step: assume the agent’s state indicates the user can save $50 this month,
and  the  agent  chooses  to  save  $50.  The  persona  is,  say,  low-income  low-saver  (Persona  A)  who  might  find  $50
challenging. We prompt GPT accordingly:

8.1. Example Interaction

•  User: “I’ve got $2000 in credit card debt and not much savings. What should I do this month to improve my

•

finances?”
(Internally,  the  agent  state  might  be  savings  =  $0,  debt  =  $2000,  persona  =  “low-income,  low-saver”.  Agent
decides an action: pay $50 towards debt, or save $50, depending on how we formulate action for debt vs saving.
Assume it chose save $50.)

•  Assistant (powered by GPT, given the agent’s suggestion): “Given what you’ve shared, I’d recommend trying
to set aside an extra $50 toward your debts or savings this month. It’s a small step, but it will chip away at that
$2000 debt. For example, you could cut a bit from your food or entertainment budget to free up $50. Doing this
consistently can help lower your credit card balance and also start building some emergency savings. Every
little bit counts! How does that sound?”

This  reply  illustrates  how  the  quantitative  suggestion  ($50)  is  wrapped  in  explanation  and  encouragement,  and  it
addresses both debt and savings since the user mentioned debt. The actual content would depend on how we instruct
the GPT model. We likely would instruct it to emphasize debt repayment in this scenario (maybe the RL agent’s action
space should include a “pay debt” action—this could be an extension of our environment).

•  Financial APIs: In a real system, integration with financial APIs (like Plaid for account data, or brokerage APIs
for investment transactions) would be necessary. In our prototype, we simulate the data and actions. But one
could use something like:

o  Use Plaid API to fetch accounts and transactions to get state inputs.
o  Use a brokerage API to execute an investment recommendation (if the agent suggests investing in a

fund).

o  Use Open Banking APIs to move money (if suggests transferring $X to savings account).

These  integrations  are  straightforward  technically  (through  API  calls)  but  require  security  and  compliance
considerations.  For  this  research  prototype,  we  focused  on  the  decision  logic,  assuming  that  such  integrations  are
handled by a separate engineering layer.

9. Results

We  evaluate  the  PFWA  prototype  on  the  synthetic  scenario  to  verify:  (a)  the  RL  agent’s  effectiveness  in  improving
financial  outcomes,  (b)  the  interpretability  of  persona-driven  behavior,  and  (c)  the  quality  of  the  conversational
explanations.

9.1. RL Agent Performance

As shown earlier in Figure 2, the RL agent’s training curve indicates it learns a policy that yields higher final savings
than the naive baseline. A naive strategy might be, for instance, saving nothing (resulting in expected final savings of $0
minus any shocks which would lead to debt). Another naive strategy could be always saving a fixed moderate amount
(say  $20  each  month),  which  would  yield  $240  saved  (minus  shocks).  The  learned  policy  tends to  maximize  saving
(subject to stochastic events). To quantify results, we compare the learned policy to two baselines:

•  Baseline 1: Save 0 each month. This is a worst-case behavior (some individuals unfortunately do this due to
lack of discipline). In our simulation, saving 0 means if any shock occurs, you go into $30 debt. Expected final
outcome is negative (since shocks have a 10% chance each month, expected one or two shocks a year leading
to -$30 or -$60 on average).

•  Baseline 2: Always save $50 each month (if possible). This is an ideal disciplined strategy (though a real
user might not follow it, it’s a useful benchmark). If no shocks, final savings = $600; each shock reduces that by
$30. In expectation (with 10% chance each month), roughly 1.2 shocks per year on average, so expected final
~$600 - 1.2*30 = $564.

•  Learned policy: We run the learned policy for say 1000 simulation trials (episodes) and compute the average

final savings.

1580

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

In our experiments, the learned policy’s average final savings was around $120 (as seen in the training graph, but that
was with $\epsilon$-exploration; with a greedy execution and fewer shocks, it should be higher). Indeed, when we test
the converged policy without exploration, it achieved an average final savings of about $450 across multiple simulations
(sometimes full $600 when no shocks, sometimes lower when shocks hit early before it started saving heavily). This is
significantly  better  than  baseline  1  (which  often  ended  negative)  and  closes  the  gap  towards  baseline  2.  The  slight
shortfall from baseline 2 is because the agent occasionally didn’t save maximum early on in some trials (due to the
learned policy’s nuances discussed). If we incorporate a small per-step reward for savings or penalize ending in debt
more, the agent would likely match the always-save baseline policy.

The  key  takeaway  is that  the RL  agent can  learn sensible  financial strategies (like prioritizing saving money for
emergencies). With a richer action space, we expect it would also learn to handle trade-offs like paying high-interest
debt vs. saving. In a more complex scenario with investments, an RL agent could learn, for example, when it’s optimal
to invest extra cash versus keeping it as cash buffer.

9.2. Persona-Driven Behavior

By  injecting  persona  information,  we  observed  differences  in  agent  behavior  for  different  personas.  In  our  simple
environment, personas didn’t drastically change the optimal action (since mathematically, “save as much as possible”
was similar for all). However, if we imagine a scenario with different reward functions, we can see how it would diverge:

•  Persona A (low-income, low-saver): For such a user, we might prioritize avoiding debt and building a small
emergency fund. The agent might take a slightly less aggressive stance to ensure the user can follow (especially
if we incorporate user feedback).

•  Persona C (high-income, high-saver): This user can afford to invest; the agent might suggest investments in
addition to saving, or taking on calculated risk (if our model allowed it). Without risk of not following, the agent
would push to fully optimize (which it basically does by saving $50 every month).

•  Persona B (middle): Something in between.

To illustrate persona effect qualitatively, imagine we had trained separate agents:

•  Agent for Persona A might have a reward function that strongly penalizes debt (so it will ensure to have some

savings to never go negative, even if it means not maximizing final net worth).

•  Agent for Persona C might be okay occasionally dipping into slight debt if it allows more investing that yields

higher return (if that dynamic existed).

Our current results show that incorporating persona didn’t harm performance and provides a pathway to include those
customizations. The cluster analysis from Figure 1 validates that our synthetic personas are well-separated, which is a
necessary step for persona-driven policies.

9.3. Trust and Engagement

While not a numeric metric in our simulation, an important result of this work is the anticipated increase in user trust
and engagement. By providing advice that is tailored (thanks to personas and RL learning user-specific patterns) and
communicated effectively (thanks to NLP), users are more likely to follow through. This can be argued based on known
behavior: Users often ignore generic budget advice, but if the advice feels “just for me” and is delivered with empathy,
they may be motivated. As Lo et al. noted, personalizing the tone and content can increase the chance the client follows
the advice. Our system attempts to do exactly that.

In  a  user  study  (which  is  future  work),  one  would  measure  engagement  by  things  like:  frequency  of  user-agent
interaction,  percentage  of  recommendations  followed,  and  user  satisfaction  surveys.  We  hypothesize  that  a
personalized RL-backed agent would score higher on these than a static rule-based advisor.

10. Conclusion

This  paper  presented  a  comprehensive  framework  and  prototype for  a  personalized  financial  wellness  advisor  that
combines reinforcement learning, behavioral analytics, and natural language interaction. We addressed the common
problem  that  many  individuals  face:  difficulty  in  saving  adequately,  investing  wisely,  and  sticking  to  a  budget.  Our
proposed solution uses a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent to provide tailored recommendations in real-
time, backed by insights from user persona clustering and delivered through a conversational AI interface.

1581

International Journal of Science and Research Archive, 2025, 15(01), 1567-1583

In developing this solution, we made several contributions:

•  We  formulated  personal  finance  management  as  a  sequential  decision-making  problem  suitable  for

reinforcement learning, capturing the trade-offs and uncertainties inherent in financial planning.

•  We introduced a personalization layer through clustering, ensuring that the RL agent accounts for different
user behaviors and preferences from the outset. This approach recognizes that financial advice is not one-size-
fits-all and that grouping similar users can accelerate learning and improve relevance.

•  We  leveraged  state-of-the-art  NLP  (OpenAI’s  GPT  models)  to  create  a  user-friendly  dialogue  system.  This
system  translates  the  quantitative  outputs  of  the  RL  agent  into  natural  language  recommendations  and
explanations, enhancing user understanding and trust.

•  We provided an end-to-end implementation, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. The use of Python
with  common  libraries  and  APIs  indicates  that  such  a  system  can  be  built  with  existing  technologies.  We
showcased key parts of the implementation with code and visualizations, including synthetic data generation,
clustering, RL training loops, and example conversation snippets.

Our  results  in  a  simulated  environment  showed  that  the  RL  agent  learned  effective  strategies  to  improve  savings
outcomes, and the personalized dialog could plausibly engage a user. While the environment was simple, the experiment
proved  the  concept.  The  modular  design  means  that  each  component  (the  RL  algorithm,  the  clustering  method,  the
language model) can be improved or replaced as needed. For instance, more sophisticated RL algorithms like PPO or
model-based RL could be tried, or a different clustering algorithm if K-Means is not capturing certain patterns (DBSCAN
could discover non-spherical clusters like distinguishing “irregular income” users). The use of GPT-4 is cutting-edge,
but one could also consider smaller fine-tuned models for cost efficiency in a deployed system.

In terms of customer value proposition, our system aims to deliver tailored financial guidance that goes beyond generic
tips.  The  value  to  the  customer  is  multi-fold:  higher  likelihood  of  achieving  financial  goals  (because  the  advice  is
optimized and adapted to them), improved financial literacy (as the agent explains the reasoning), and a supportive
experience that can build confidence (the agent acts like a personal coach). By boosting engagement—users interacting
with  their  finances  through  the  chatbot  frequently—and  trust—users  seeing  advice  that  resonates  with  their
situation—such a system can help bridge the gap between intent and action in personal finance. Ultimately, even small
improvements  in  saving  or  investing  behavior,  when  sustained  over  years,  can  lead  to  significantly  better  financial
security for individuals.

There are challenges ahead to move this from prototype to real-world application, including handling the full complexity
of human finances, ensuring regulatory compliance, and encouraging consistent user participation. However, the trend
is clear: AI technologies are increasingly capable of personalizing and scaling services that used to require intensive
human  labor  (like  financial  advising).  Our  research  suggests  that  a  hybrid  approach—combining  the  strengths  of
different AI subfields—can create a more holistic solution than any single technique in isolation.

An Overview of Forecasting Methods for Monthly Electricity Consumption
Sofija KRSTEV, Jovana FORCAN, Dragoljub KRNETA*
Abstract: Mid-term electricity consumption forecasting is analysed in this paper. Forecasting of electricity consumption is regression problem that can be defined as using
previous consumption of an individual or a group with the goal of calculation of future consumption using some mathematical or statistical approach. The purpose of this
prediction is multi beneficial to the stakeholders in the energy community, since this information can affect production, sales and supply. The Different methods are considered
with the main goal to determine the best forecasting model. Considered methods include Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average models, state-space models
and exponential smoothing, and machine learning methods including neural networks. An additional objective of the conducted research was to determine if modern methods
like machine learning are equally precise in forecasting mid-term electricity consumption when compared to traditional time series methods. The performances of forecasting
models are evaluated on the monthly electricity consumption data obtained using real billing software owned by the Distribution System Operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mean absolute percentage error is selected as a measure of prediction accuracy of forecasting methods. Every forecasting method is implemented and tested using the R
language, while data is collected from Data Warehouse in the form of total monthly consumption. The efficiency of presented solution will also be discussed after presentation
of the results.

expected as the sample size is quite small.
To compare absolute relative errors per month, three
methods are chosen (one from each category): ETS(A, N,
A) which showed better accuracy than other classical time
series methods, PCA+KNN which performed better than
other machine learning methods used with PCA or lm, and
the neural network model NNAR(3, 1, 6). The comparison
of absolute relative errors per month for these methods is
given in Tab. 3.  When considering absolute relative errors
per months then the modelsꞌ results can be very different
from each other. Some models give a better prediction for

on the behavior of the data for the observed month in the November 2019. PCA+KNN is at least accurate for
given years. January, September, November 2019, and March 2020.
For May 2019, November 2019, February 2020 and March
2020 ETS(A, N ,A) showed the smallest accuracy. For all
three models, the obtained MAPE for the month of
November is larger than 7%, and the MAPEs of these
methods are the most comparable for this month.
Although, the MAPE is the main chosen indicator for
selecting the best forecasting model in this paper, absolute
relative errors per month can provide an additional insight
that can be useful for DSO special applications, such as
comparison of errors per month or seasons.

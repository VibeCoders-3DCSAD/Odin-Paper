Introduction: What is mobile-first and responsive cartographic design?
In this article, we present a collective research agenda for mobile-first and
responsive cartographic design. More maps are viewed on mobile devices
today than in any other format, media, or platform (see Lella and Lipsman

2014; Ricker, Schuurman, and Kessler 2015; Smith et al. 2015; Anderson 2016;
Abraham 2019, for some projections), although deep inequities in mobile
access persist (Taylor and Silver 2019; Kraak et al. 2020). Yet, much of the
cartographic canon we teach and practice was established for the design of
printed maps, where ink is immutable but precise, map sheets are big but
foldable or bound in an atlas volume, and map design bends to the map-
makers’ intentions rather than the map users’ individual needs and context.
Even contemporary treatments explicitly on interactive and web-based carto-
graphy rarely consider mobile as the primary design platform (see Zipf 2002;
Reichenbacher 2004; Meng, Zipf, and Reichenbacher, 2005; Muehlenhaus
2013, for notable exceptions), instead imagining widescreens, external input
devices, and reliable networks and bandwidth. How must cartographic
design adapt to consider the mobile context first?
Mobile cartography and visualization intersect several emerging research foci
and design practices in user experience (UX) design, or the iterative set of
decisions leading to a successful outcome with an interface, mobile or other-
wise, as well as a productive and satisfying process while arriving at this out-
come (Garrett 2010; Roth 2017a). Mobile first describes an approach to UX
design that is optimized for the technological constraints of mobile devices,
such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and heads-up displays (Mullins
2015; Ricker and Roth 2018). Mobile-first constraints include: small screen view-
ing, limited wireless connectivity and costly data plans, limited battery life, and
touch-based user interaction, among others (see below for more detail).
However, these constraints give mobile devices their fundamental utility: the
physical mobility of the device in the landscape and resulting ubiquity of mobile
computing in society (Satyanarayanan 2001; Gartner, Bennett, and Morita 2007).
Accordingly, mobile first is a design philosophy that considers the most con-
strained user experience before others (Roth 2019b) and, therefore, reinforces
tenets of the broader inclusive design movement that prioritizes support for
marginalized users and use cases throughout the design process (Shum et al.
2016; D’Ignazio and Klein 2020). Mobile-first design serves as the anchor point
for a broader responsive design strategy that dynamically adapts the content,
layout, and styling from the constrained, mobile use case to flexible, non-mobile
use cases (Marcotte 2010).
The article proceeds with seven sections. Next, we review relevant back-
ground on cartographic design decisions and workflows, situating these design
considerations within the constraints, enablements, and consequences of
mobile technology. We then build upon this review in subsequent sections to
present 20 research challenges facing mobile-first and responsive cartography
and visualization (Table 1). The Table 1 research agenda was derived from
presentations and discussions held during a two-day workshop on ‘Mobile
Map UX’ preceding the 2019 International Cartography Conference that was
attended by 70 scholars from nine countries; Roth, Griffin, and Huang (2024)

archy, (4) toponymy and typography, and (5) user interaction. We conclude by

mobile-first and responsive cartographic design.
Background: A partial design space for mobile maps and visualizations
Design can be used in cartography and visualization to refer to both a map or
visualization product as well as the process executed to arrive at this product
(Nestel 2019a). As a product, design refers to the map or visualization as a visual,
sonic, haptic, etc., representation of real-world phenomena and processes, and
descriptions of the product may include the manner by which depicted data are
generalized, projected, symbolized, or annotated with labels as well as the
overall visual harmony and balance or the overarching aesthetics and style
(Kraak et al. 2020). With the move to an interactive and digital medium, treating
design as a product also can refer to the functional scope of the map or

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 411
visualization, such as the implemented interaction operators and their direct or
indirect manipulation interface styles, as well as other non-functional yet valu-
able characteristics to the overall user experience, such as accessibility, inter-
operability, reliability, and usability (Roth 2019a).
As a process, design refers to the range of decisions a cartographer must first
plan and then execute to move from initial concept to final product (Buckingham
2019). Design is an intentional activity, representing how the cartographers and
designers assert their positionalities and worldviews onto their products, and
therefore how maps and visualizations become authored and subjective (extend-
ing Harley 1989). Further, treating design as a process acknowledges that any map
or visualization is in a continual state of becoming, landing with each user
differently based on their unique lived experiences, mapping needs, and envel-
oping cultural, political, and technological practices (Kitchin and Dodge 2007).
Accordingly, mobile-first and responsive design together present a critical arena
in cartography and visualization for uniting new understandings of both product
and process in support of a highly-dynamic, mobile user experience.
Following this line of thinking, we treat design as a flexible solution space –
acknowledging that some design alternatives may be superior to others in a
specific use and user context – and assert that much of the existing guidance in
cartography and visualization for navigating this design space needs to be
fundamentally rethought or expanded for mobile maps and visualizations.
Specifically, we call for a comprehensive reevaluation of the established carto-
graphic canon to explicitly adapt design thinking across mobile and non-mobile
contexts (Rowe 1991). Empirical research can inform dimensions of this expanded
mobile-first and responsive design space, including both controlled experiments
seeking generalizable and reproducible insights as well as design case studies
seeking transferable and contextual insights (Sedlmair, Meyer, and Munzner 2012;
Roth 2019a). Artistic, computational, and critical ways of knowing also can con-
tribute to this expanded design space (Robinson et al. 2017).
Figure 1 presents five dimensions (i.e., sets of design decisions) of the carto-
graphic design space requiring future research for adaptation to mobile. The
demarcation of five dimensions is based on a general design workflow captur-
ing clusters of similar cartographic design decisions to organize discussion, and
these dimensions could be sliced at different granularities. We detail each
Figure 1 dimension below.
● Scale & Generalization: Scale is a fundamental, yet multifaceted concept
in geography and related disciplines broadly referring to the resolution and
extent of a phenomenon (Goodchild 2011). In cartography, scale specifi-
cally describes distance relationships between the map and Earth, with a
smaller versus larger cartographic scale map depicting more regional
versus more local phenomena, respectively (Raposo 2017).
Generalization, in contrast, is the meaningful removal of detail when

enablements, and consequences are placed qualitatively, and may impact all topics in the design

setting or changing scale (Robinson et al. 1995), and thus is an intentional
design process aimed at maintaining legibility at the given scale and for the
intended context. Like interactive web maps, mobile maps and visualiza-
tions often are generalized across many scales at multiple levels of detail
(LODs), supplying multiple representations of variable visual complexity for
the same map feature (Weibel and Dutton 1999; Sarjakoski 2007; see Elias,
Hampe, and Sester 2005; Chen and Clarke 2020 for adaptations to mobile).
Common multiscale generalization operators (i.e., generalization design
decisions) include: select, simplify, smooth, exaggerate, displace, collapse,
aggregate, merge, resymbolize, and enhance, among others (e.g., Brewer
and Buttenfield 2007; Roth, Brewer, and Stryker 2011; Kraak et al. 2020).
● Map Projections: Map projection is the process of imperfectly translating
geospatial data from a three-dimensional model of the Earth to the two-
dimensional map, with the projection always distorting map properties in

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 413
some way, such as areas, angles, or distances (Battersby 2017). While
mathematically calculated by computers today, selecting and configuring
projections remains an intentional design process aimed at managing
distortions across the map based on its purpose and mapped location.
Traditional projection design decisions include: class (e.g., cylindrical, conic,
planar), case (e.g., tangent, secant), aspect (e.g., normal, transverse, obli-
que), centering, and the preserved map properties (e.g., conformal, equal-
area, azimuthal, equidistant) (Kessler and Battersby 2019). The Web
Mercator projection – a non-conformal variant of the conformal and cylind-
rical Mercator projection originally intended for sea navigation – remains
the common solution for multiscale digital mapping given its deconstruc-
tion into interlocking square tilesets, despite its limitations for many map-
ping contexts, mobile or otherwise (Battersby et al. 2014).
● Symbolization & Visual Hierarchy: Symbolization describes the meaningful
encoding of information using visuals, sounds, haptics, etc. (White 2017), and
is conceptually similar to using an alphabet, dictionary lexicon, and gram-
matical syntax for written communication. Far from an arbitrary choice,
symbolization is an intentional design process aimed at choosing encodings
from a finite set of sensory channels while taking into consideration cultural,
political, and technological connotations and constraints that influence their
interpretation. Graphic symbolization relies on the visual variables, or basic
building blocks of a visual scene, which include: location, size, shape, color
hue, color value, color saturation, orientation, texture, arrangement, trans-
parency, crispness, and resolution (Bertin 1967/1983; MacEachren 1995).
Visual hierarchy describes the order that map symbols and other labels and
elements are perceived visually (Tait 2018). Intentionally designed visual hier-
archy results in some symbols rising to the figure, which might include
quantitative data symbolized through thematic map overlays (e.g., choropleth,
proportional symbol, dot density, isoline/surface), and some symbols falling to
the ground, which might include basemap tilesets at variable generalizations
and levels of detail (e.g., streets, satellite, terrain). We collapse symbolization
with visual hierarchy – commonly separate design topics in cartography and
visualization – given their combined impact on visual complexity, which
typically needs to be reduced for mobile maps and visualizations rendered
on small screens with variable environmental viewing conditions.
● Toponomy & Typography: Toponyms are place names and can originate
from within a named place (endonym) or from outside a named place
(exonym), with toponyms sometimes requiring transliteration or transcrip-
tion between languages and character sets for interpretation across geo-
graphies, histories, and cultures (Ormeling 2000). Intentional design of
toponyms is particularly important to support a diverse audience when
moving across cultural, political, and social boundaries, and choosing

414 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
appropriate toponyms requires a careful balance between familiarity for
users and sovereignty of Indigenous and local communities (Berg and
Vuolteenaho 2009; Rose-Redwood, Alderman, and Azaryahu 2010).
Typography then describes the placement and appearance of these place
names as labels on maps (Guidero 2017). Drawing on toponomy and typo-
graphy, labeling is an intentional design processes aimed at adding impor-
tant details back into the map that are otherwise lost through generalization,
symbolization, and other abstraction. Conventionally, labels are styled to
evoke congruence with the labeled feature, using variations in typeface
(serif, sans serif), type size, type style (roman, bold, italics), type color, and
type spacing to evoke nominal or ordinal differences, whereas labels are
placed to minimize overprinting while maintaining graphic association
between symbol and label, with recommendations specific to point, line,
and polygon feature dimensionalities (Imhof 1975). Finally, mobile-first label
considerations may be expanded beyond text directly on the map to include
text-based alerts and notifications when moving.
● User Interaction: Interaction describes the two-way question-answer
sequence between a user and map mediated through a computing device
(Roth 2012). Interaction enables the user to change the display in real-time
based on their needs and interests (MacEachren and Monmonier 1992),
and therefore user interface (UI) design is an intentional process aimed at
implementing functionality that empowers users to do more with their
maps and visualizations while constraining functionality that may lead to
confusing or misleading views. UI design relies on interaction operators, or
interactions generic across maps and visualizations that serve as the basic
building blocks of an interface similar to the visual variables in symboliza-
tion. Interaction operators include: those that change the design (reex-
press, overlay, sequence, resymbolize); those that change the user’s
perspective (zoom, pan, reproject, arrange); and those change or derive
content (search, filter, retrieve, calculate) (see Roth 2013a; Kraak et al. 2020
for complete definitions). While research and practice on UI design in
cartography remains in its infancy broadly (MacEachren 2013), mobile-
first interaction is a unique design context for maps and visualizations
given reliance on multi-touchscreens and other post-WIMP (windows,
icons, menus, pointers) interfaces (Van Dam 1997; Shneiderman and
Plaisant 2020). Further, mobile-first interaction design also requires new,
creative UI designs and layouts to implement interaction operators intui-
tively on constrained screen sizes.
There is a small but growing literature in cartography and visualization on
strategies to adapt and expand the Figure 1 cartographic design space for
mobile use cases. Some of this work focuses on the constraints that mobile

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 415
technology imposes on design, which include: small screen sizes (with screen
resolution becoming less of an issue on recent mobile devices), reduced or less
reliable bandwidth (with processing power becoming less of an issue on recent
mobile devices), costly data plans (exacerbated by the continued digital divide),
limited battery capacity, and variable viewing conditions (Chittaro 2006;
Çöltekin and Reichenbacher 2011; Nagi 2014). Because these technological
and economic constraints also impact non-mobile digital maps, but generally
to a lesser degree, understanding the relative impact of these constraints on
maps and visualizations is important for both mobile-first and responsive carto-
graphic design (Roth 2013b). Abraham (2019) provides a comprehensive review
on historical and contemporary mobile technology, and the constraints therein
on cartographic design.
In contrast, a subset of research approaches design enablements specific to
mobile-first design only. Such enablements include: handheld or wearable use
while moving in the environment (e.g., Clarke 2004; Goodchild et al. 2004),
direct manipulation interaction through touchscreens (e.g., Muehlenhaus 2011;
Newbury et al. 2021), multimodal voice, gesture, and gaze-based input and
multimodal haptic, sonic, and tactile output (Huang et al. 2018), the possibility
of seamless maps between indoor and outdoor environments (e.g., Huang and
Gartner 2009; Chen and Clarke 2020), and the ability to deliver customized maps
and visualizations using location-based services based on the device’s GPS
receiver and other spatial sensors (e.g., Dao, Rizos, and Wang 2002; Tsou 2004;
Meng 2005). Huang et al. (2018) provide a research agenda specific to location-
based services, with the Huang et al. (2024) research agenda in this special issue
expanding this overview to opportunities at the intersection of location-based
services and mobile-first cartography and visualization.
Finally, a subset of research explores the unintended consequences of mobi-
lity and location-based services on the users of mobile maps and visualizations.
Possible consequences include diminished spatial cognition and memory (e.g.,
Ishikawa et al. 2008; Dillemuth 2009), eroded location privacy and increased
surveillance (e.g., Wilson 2012; Ricker, Schuurman, and Kessler 2015), and per-
sonal safety concerns related to split attention and other environmental hazards
(e.g., Reichenbacher 2001; Roth et al. 2018). Griffin et al. (2024) address these
cognitive and cultural challenges related to mobile cartography, and are
repeated here only when explicitly linked to design considerations.
Table 2 summarizes the evolving recommendations in the literature for
explicitly-cartographic mobile-first and responsive design (updated from Roth
et al. 2018; Ricker and Roth 2018), relating the Figure 1 design space to the
aforementioned constraints, enablements, and consequences of mobile tech-
nology. Figure 2 illustrates how some of the Table 2 design decisions may
respond to mobile (expanding upon Kraak et al. 2020). The purpose of the
following research agenda is not to repeat this summary of existing work
beyond the Table 2 summary, but to use it as a foundation for identifying and

contextualizing the research and design gaps facing mobile-first and responsive
design outlined in Table 1.
Mobile-first and responsive scale and generalization
Should generalization be speed- or cost-dependent rather than scale-
dependent for mobile-first cartography and visualization?
Perhaps no design consideration for mobile-first cartography and visualization
has received more attention over the past two decades than the level of detail
(LOD) in the representation, or the number and complexity of features in the map
or visualization (Bozkurt et al. 2005). Convention in cartography suggests that the
optimal number of features and LOD primarily are dependent upon the selected
(or for interactive maps, the default) cartographic scale (e.g., Töpfer and Pillewizer
1966; Ratajski 1967; see Edwardes, Burghardt, and Weibel 2005 for adaptation to
mobile). Early discussions on mobile-first cartography and visualization warned
that supplying detailed representations when moving in the landscape may
overwhelm the user’s cognitive abilities and divert attention away from the
environment (e.g., Meng and Reichenbacher 2005; Reichenbacher 2005;
Meilinger et al. 2007). Constraints of mobile technology such as screen size,

420 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
bandwidth, and processing power also logically suggest that less detail or retriev-
ing details only on demand is better for mobile devices (Chittaro 2006).
However, results from empirical research on mobile-first default scale and asso-
ciated LOD are varied. For instance, a larger default scale for mobile devices
depicting immediate environmental surroundings may help with the accuracy of
identifying nearby landmarks and navigating a local landscape (e.g., Dillemuth
2005; van Tonder and Wesson 2009; Davidson 2014), but a smaller default scale
showing a broader overview may help with the efficiency and accuracy of distance
and direction estimates across wider regions (e.g., MacEachren 1992; Dillemuth
2009; Willis et al. 2009). Bartling et al. (2021, 14) found no performance difference on
mobile devices by default scale and LOD, suggesting an optimal amount of general-
ization that follows an ‘inverted U-shape’ curve by task and that ‘Neither low nor
high levels of map detail complexities aid the users’, a finding triangulated by other
studies on non-mobile maps and visualizations (e.g., Bestgen et al. 2017; Lokka et al.
2018; Liao et al. 2019; Vincent et al. 2019; Keil et al. 2020).
While mobile users still may require variable levels of detail by scale and task (as
first suggested by Harrie, Sarjakoski, and Lehto 2002), the default scale and LOD
for a given mobile map or visualization actually may be contingent on several
unique conditions of mobile devices. First, different modes of travel result in very
different experiences of the environment, with speed of travel in particular
impacting the salience of features in and overall depth of engagement with the
landscape (Edwardes, Burghardt, and Weibel 2005; Winter, Raubal, and Nothegger
2005). Nearly all contemporary mobile devices are equipped with an acceler-
ometer to detect speed and infer mode of travel (Abraham 2019). Arguably a
mobile map (and users of these maps) traveling at higher speeds (e.g., walking vs.
driving vs. flying) needs more overview and less detail, as it can access a greater
region within a given amount of time. Thus, we need generalization strategies
based on the user’s travel range – a mobile concept consistent with the space-time
prism in time geography (see Miller 1991 on; Hägerstrand 1970) – not the
cartographic scale, with the travel range modeled using spatial buffers, network
analysis, or novel techniques calibrated for specific modes of travel (Loeffler et al.
2021; Figure 3c). There also is potential to integrate other mobile sensors, such as
the barometer, compass, and gyroscope, as well as crowdsourced mobile datasets
to infer more about the user’s travel and further restrict the travel range, improv-
ing selection and rendering of relevant features onscreen (Ricker, Schuurman, and
Kessler 2015; Ricker 2019). The default scale even may suggest the intended mode
of travel for the mobile map or visualization, ‘immers[ing] the users into a specific
geographic scale, context, or story’ (Abraham 2019, 107), or respond based on the
user’s initial or current speed (van Tonder and Wesson 2009; Davidson 2014;
Loeffler et al. 2021).
Second, the amount of detail loaded into and rendered on the mobile map or
visualization has a cost (Loeffler et al. 2021). The cost of adding more detail is at
least three-fold: a financial cost on mobile data plans, a battery cost with

2021). Flyover Country (http://flyovercountry.io/) is a free, mobile-first mobile mapping
application that visualizes public data resources about the Earth’s geology and history as
users observe the landscape from an airplane window seat, during a road trip, or while on
a field trip. A: The default map view upon opening Flyover Country, emphasizing its global
coverage. B: Users can request data along a path by directly tapping on the map, and
while this is a novel interaction, there is no visual affordance for the post-WIMP interac-
tion; users also can create a path by tapping the floating action button (FAB) at the
bottom, supporting interaction flexibility for the post-WIMP, mobile-first interaction strat-
egy. C: Tapping the FAB activates a screen allowing users to switch between driving and
flying mode and select desired layers on the map. D: Loading a route renders available
records within the selected drive or flight path, using a dark basemap and light UI to
preserve battery life and overall energy consumption. E: Users can save selected paths for
offline use, with Flyover Country providing an affordance about estimated download sizes
to give users a sense of the potential costs of the data download. F: Previously saved paths
also are available for viewing offline, and can be deleted to free storage space. G: Users
can activate an oblique, egocentric view while driving or flying to improve recognition of
landscape features. H: Selecting a point on the map activates a bottom pull-up menu with
information about the selected record.

increased connecting, processing, and screen rendering, and a carbon cost from
the accumulated energy consumption across all users (the latter is treated in
more detail below). While unlimited data plans are common in developed and
developing countries, unequal access to mobile technology and data services (i.
e., a digital divide) persists across and within all countries (Taylor and Silver 2019;
Kraak et al. 2020). Even with a data plan, added detail wears on battery life and,
combined with potential gaps in connectivity while moving, may leave the user
lost or stranded in the landscape (Roth et al. 2018). Common data conservation
solutions do not consider the resulting design of the map itself, potentially
imposing illegible color distortions in ‘Low Power’ or ‘Battery Saver’ mode (Wu
et al. 2018; see discussion of Figure 8 below), or require caching all information
at once for an offline mode (Loeffler et al. 2021; Figure 3e-f; Roth et al. 2018;
Figure 12a-b). We need a better understanding of the relative financial, battery,
and carbon costs of different generalization operators for maintaining legible
mobile maps and visualizations. A simple strategy may be to relate speed or cost
breakpoints to specific levels of details in existing multiscale databases.
However, speed-dependent or cost-dependent generalization may result in
new strategies for multiscale map design altogether, as less commonly auto-
mated generalization operators including displace, exaggerate, resymbolize,
and enhance may effectively emphasize relevant features when moving and
avoid complex server-side pre-processing (Brewer and Buttenfield 2007).
How should mobile maps and visualizations be generalized at the vista scale?
The possibility of mobile enables maps and visualizations to serve as interactive
information repositories accessed when directly situated in the places they
represent (Roth et al. 2018). While maps and visualizations as mental abstrac-
tions are unbounded by scale (MacEachren 1995), most cartographic general-
ization principles were developed to abstract phenomena that exist on a scale
larger than what could be observed directly by a person at any given time, with
such ‘act of generalization giv[ing] the map its raison d’etre’ (Robinson et al.
1995, 42). However, emerging environmental and social sensing technologies
have enabled the creation of an LOD consistent with the vista scale, or the scale
of the human body and the immediately observable vicinity (Montello 1993).
This includes the possibility of extended reality discussed below, with maps and
visualizations at the vista scale potentially replicating surrounding reality with
hyper-realism (e.g., Mathews and Frazier 2017; Huang 2018; Yanow 2018). But,
why reconstruct and retain details at the vista scale that we already can observe
directly through our senses? We need to rethink principles of selection, simpli-
fication, etc., to support meaningful abstraction at the vista scale.
Generalization at the vista scale also requires asking whose vantage points
are and are not included in the mapped and visualized data (D’Ignazio and Klein
2020; Kelly 2020), and thus which data traces are captured in or erased from the

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 423
digital landscape. Location-based services were triumphed early in mobile
cartography and visualization as an opportunity to level the playing field
through ‘amateur cartography’ (McConchie 2015), ‘citizen science’ (Haklay
2013), ‘crowdsourced cartography’ (Dodge and Kitchin 2013), ‘democratized
cartography’ (Rød, Ormeling, and van Elzakker 2001), ‘neogeography’ (Turner
2006), and ‘volunteered’ (Goodchild 2007) or ‘contributed’ (Harvey 2013) geo-
graphic information. Yet, ‘[w]hile these services can be harnessed for the collec-
tion and digitization of local knowledge, bringing attention to places and issues
that may not receive notice otherwise, other communities may go under
represented making digital divides (in)visible digitally’ (Ricker, Schuurman, and
Kessler 2015, 639).
For instance, mobile-first generalization at the vista scale intersects the
quantified-self movement (Swan 2012, 2013), and selection and other general-
ization operators could be tied to biometric and environment sensors, such as
heart rate, temperature, and humidity, as well as other bluetooth-support
external devices, to further personalize the mobile map or visualization to the
user’s current activity (Nelson and MacEachren 2020). Yet, such continuous self-
quantification cannot be divorced from its economic, political, and social impli-
cations on privacy, surveillance, and marginalization (Wilson 2015). Accordingly,
we need an ethics of generalization for the vista scale that encourages equity
and diversity in selection (see Zook and Graham 2007; Crampton 2009; Wilson
2011; Elwood and Leszczynski 2013; Cinnamon and Schuurman 2013; Stephens
2013; Ricker, Daniel, and Hedley 2014 for relevant critiques), legitimizes affect
and emotion as relevant rubrics for selection (as initially proposed for mobile-
first design by Meng 2005; Gartner 2012), and finally acknowledges the act of
generalization does ‘not reflect the world as it actually is, but actively frame[s]
and produce[s] the world’ (to borrow from Kitchen, Lauriault, and McArdle
2015, 7).
How do we consistently generalize mobile maps and visualizations for both
indoor and outdoor use?
Designing mobile maps and visualizations at a human scale requires mobile maps
that work seamlessly between indoor and outdoor environments. Li (2008, 1)
defines indoors for mobile maps and visualizations as places constrained by
‘architectural components, such as doors, corridors, floors, walls, and stairs’, and
Chen and Clarke (2020, 97) note most definitions relevant to mobile cartography
‘contain the notions of full enclosure created by physical constraints, a finite size
as opposed to the unboundedness of the outdoors, and greater levels of com-
plexity’ (e.g., Jensen, Lu, and Yang 2009; Giudice, Walton, and Worboys 2010; Zhu
et al. 2016; Zlatanova and Isikdag 2016; Yan, Diakité, and Zlatanova 2018).
Notably, a given space may hold characteristics of both indoors and outdoors,
further complicating selection of features relevant to blended indoor and outdoor

424 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
wayfinding (Zhou et al. 2012; Yan, Diakité, and Zlatanova 2018; Chen and Clarke
2020).
Designing indoor-outdoor mobile maps and visualizations is both a
technical challenge (Huang et al. 2018), requiring sensor integration
between GPS and less standardized IPS (indoor positioning systems; see
Liu et al. 2007; Koyuncu and Yang 2010; Mautz 2012; Hossain and Soh 2015;
Grejner-Brzezinska et al. 2016 for reviews of IPS alternatives), as well as a
cognitive challenge (Griffin et al. 2024), with wayfinding within indoor
environments potentially relying on a different set of spatial skills and visual
cues than outdoor navigation (e.g., Gärling, Lindberg, and Mäntylä 1983;
Winter, Raubal, and Nothegger 2005). Blended indoor-outdoor mobile car-
tography also raises a number of questions about design (the focus of this
article), including best practices for integrating coordinate system and
projections, indoor-outdoor and multi-floor symbolization and user interac-
tion, and privacy protection and public safety (Figure 4).
Generalization arguably is the most pressing challenge facing blended
indoor-outdoor maps and visualizations. Indoor maps and visualizations
often are presented at the vista scale, and may be more difficult to navigate
due to smaller viewsheds and fewer salient landmarks in complex indoor
structures (Li and Klippel 2016). Accordingly, a first challenge is acquiring
and harmonizing high-resolution indoor and outdoor datasets that match
the necessary LOD for indoor navigation (Chen and Clarke 2020), possibly
higher-resolution environmental data than available in many places. Drones
and other emerging environmental and social sensors offer potential data
inputs for achieving outdoor LODs consistent with indoor LODs, although
substantial (but so far untested) generalization workflows are necessary to
derive meaningful indoor-outdoor maps and visualizations from the raw
point cloud (Chen 2018a). While a high resolution ‘digital twin’ may be
the ultimate goal for blended indoor-outdoor mobile cartography (Shahat,
Hyun, and Yeom 2021), promoting and advancing interoperability may be a
more tenable strategy to support consistent generalization to consistent
LODs (Giudice, Walton, and Worboys 2010).
Importantly, we need to adapt common point or (poly)line generalization
operators – and possibly invent new operators – to account for increased
feature dimensionalities in 3D and 4D representations now possible on
indoor mobile maps and visualizations (Zlatanova et al. 2013; Zlatanova
and Isikdag 2016). We also need better integration of vector and raster
generalization techniques given the potential of layering image textures on
both the inside and outside of 3D data models when viewed at the finest
levels of detail (Chen 2018b), which in turn requires greater cooperation
between cartography and remote sensing knowledge areas broadly
(Çöltekin, Griffin, and Robinson 2021). Further, and as with primarily outdoor
mobile cartography, more complexity may not always be needed or even

Figure 4. Responsive design solution for indoor-outdoor and multi-floor cartographic design of the
Wisconsin State Capitol Building (USA) (adapted from Rose, Roth, and Woodward 2013). The
Wisconsin State Capitol Building tileset combines digitized public floorplans of the Capitol Building
with OpenStreetMap road and building footprints, using a profile view of the Capitol to navigate
across floors. Creation of the tileset led to a number of questions about indoor-outdoor mobile map
design, for instance: How effective is projection of indoor floorplans in Web Mercator, and what
alternatives exist? Should indoor floorplans be generalized differently across scales to match the
LOD of outdoor multiscale OpenStreetMap base data? At what scales should doors be depicted as a
continuation of a wall versus an opening in a wall? At what scales should thicker walls and other
inaccessible voids be depicted as lines versus polygons? Should multi-floor atrium spaces be
occluded from all but the bottom floor of the atrium, or draw content from across floors to
match the user experience at the vista scale (i.e., what is visible versus what is navigable from a
given floor)? What is the best interaction metaphor for navigating between floors while moving?
possible with blended indoor-outdoor maps and visualizations, and we need
progressive 3D and 4D generalization solutions that account for bandwidth
and data plan unevenness when transitioning between indoor wireless net-
works and outdoor cellular networks (Roth et al. 2018). Finally, it is unlikely
that all aspects of map design can be, or even should be, fully resolved
between indoor and outdoor use cases, with some aspects of the LOD and
visual contrast remaining intentionally responsive to different indoor-outdoor
viewing and use conditions (van Tonder and Wesson 2009).
What level of detail is appropriate for augmented and mixed reality on
mobile devices?
Extended reality (XR) is a relatively recent umbrella term that refers to virtual
reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). While VR is well

426 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
understood and aspires to replace reality by ‘tricking’ the human senses, AR and
MR are conceptually similar in that both aim at enhancing the real experiences
while in place (for a more elaborate definition of each, see Çöltekin et al. 2020;
Çöltekin et al. 2020). Accordingly, AR and MR increasingly are delineated by the
presence of real-time spatial registration: In MR, virtual objects are shown in
their correct positions to match real objects (sometimes described as spatial
computing in MR), while in AR, a virtual object can be shown anywhere in the
world, such as a text prompt popping up anywhere in one’s visual (Çöltekin et al.
2020; Çöltekin et al. 2020). Thus, AR and MR are explicitly cartographic and
mobile technologies (Çöltekin 2019a).
AR and MR displays use mobile-first cartographic design not to abstract
reality, per se, but instead either highlight features in a physical scene, guiding
people’s attention to spatio-temporally relevant information, or overlay other-
wise invisible information (e.g., commercial pricings or ratings, underground
infrastructure, air temperature or pollution) onto reality (Wang, van Elzakker,
and Kraak 2017). Thus, AR and MR represent a fundamental shift in the relation-
ship between maps and generalization: rather than generalizing a map to cull
meaning from the complexity of the real world, they augment a real scene by
overlaying generalized layers atop this complexity to provide more detail than is
directly observable. Countless mobile AR and MR applications have been pro-
posed as proof-of-concepts (e.g., Narzt et al. 2006; Joshi et al. 2020; Murari et al.
2021) and some AR and MR applications already transitioned to real-world use
such as indoor and outdoor navigation (e.g., Google AR and VR 2021) and
infrastructure visualizations to assist field work (e.g., Schall et al. 2009;
Mascarenas et al. 2021), among others.
Further, Çöltekin et al. (2020) propose the possibility of ‘generalizing reality’
by occluding real information in the real world using partially transparent,
blurred, or textured virtual curtains (i.e., a form of simplification); few examples
of generalized reality in mobile AR and MR exist to-date, representing a fruitful
new avenue of research. Potentially relevant work includes LOD management
from computer graphics (Luebke et al. 2003), which comprises innovative image
processing techniques (e.g., visibility culling and level of detail management
based on distance, size, or velocity) that may enhance or expand geometric
operators common in cartographic generalization (Çöltekin 2006), many of
which have a perceptual (e.g., eccentricity LOD, depth of field LOD) or cognitive
(e.g., priority LOD) basis. Modern XR devices often come equipped with eye
tracking and foveated rendering options, both of which provide additional LOD
management possibilities such as gaze-contingent displays (e.g., Bektaş et al.
2015) that could ultimately lead to useful and usable ‘generalizations of reality’
in mobile AR and MR.
Whether we augment or simplify our surrounding environment through
mobile AR and MR, key questions remain on what additional details should be
provided and why, which objects can be safely occluded, and with what level of

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 427
detail the virtual objects must be rendered? As in cartographic generalization,
these questions do not have a clear-cut answer because of their multi-factorial,
ill-defined nature. Proposed solutions mostly build on the abovementioned LOD
management concepts that date back decades (Park, Chou, and Hwang 2018;
Keil et al. 2018), while many of the more sophisticated solutions remain depen-
dent on inferring a user’s context and intentions. One way of approaching LODs
for virtual objects integrated into real scenes is to characterize and control their
visual complexity (Lokka and Çöltekin 2019), such as using real-time saliency
(Tliba et al. 2022; Sutton et al. 2022) or visual clutter algorithms (Flittner and
Gabbard 2021) to automatize mobile AR and MR generalization. If multi-factor
automatization is achievable, such an approach could help overcome both
computational and cognitive issues around information overload inherent to
mobile AR and MR when more detail on an already complex and dynamic real-
world scene as the user moves through it.
Mobile-first and responsive projections
What is the efficacy of egocentric designs and oblique projections?
Egocentrism describes an explicit interest in and viewpoint from the self (see
Towler 1970 for early definition and connection to map use). Mobile devices also
enable egocentric projection considerations at the vista scale introduced above,
and may include centering the map projection on the user’s location, updating
the user’s position while moving, and rotating and tilting the map so that
‘forward’ rather than ‘north’ is ‘up’ in the display (Meng 2005). Egocentric
designs engender a ‘sense of place’ or ‘place attachment’ (see Lewicka 2011
for a synthesis and review) and may help users orient themselves on the map
(e.g., Burigat, Chittaro, and Sioni 2017), relate salient landmarks between map
and environment (e.g., Oulasvirta, Nurminen, and Nivala 2007), and wayfind
using embodied routing directions (e.g., Klippel et al. 2005). However, egocentr-
ism presents new challenges that cross all three research agendas in this special
issue. Egocentric views have been critiqued by cartographers for shifting
emphasis from configural to procedural knowledge and ultimately impeding
environmental knowledge acquisition and spatial cognition (e.g., Richardson,
Montello, and Hegarty 1999; Willis et al. 2009; Huang, Schmidt, and Gartner
2012; Wen, Ishikawa, and Sato 2013; Griffin et al. 2017). Further, egocentric
projections are a technical challenge, as location-based services supporting
egocentrism may be spatially imprecise or slow to update, leading to distracting
or misleading information on the map or visualization (Davidson 2014; Huang
et al. 2018). Location-based services supporting egocentrism such as a ‘tracking
mode’ also quickly drain battery when continuously active, with a ‘dead’ mobile
phone potentially leaving users lost or stranded in the landscape (Roth et al.
2018; Figure 12e).

428 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
Regarding design, the efficacy of egocentric maps and visualizations hinge
on oblique projections that orient the aspect of the developable surface to the
reference global at an angle other than the Earth’s axis of rotation (a normal
aspect) or orthogonally from the axis of rotation (a transverse aspect), resulting
in a more pictorial representation of the landscape (Loeffler et al. 2021;
Figure 3f). Oblique projections historically were less common than alternatives
because they were considered to serve a smaller range of specialist use cases
(Ward 1979) and typically are more difficult to plot than normal or transverse
aspects (Dent 1987). However, real-time oblique projections are now possible
with vector tiling and WebGL mapping technology (Diamond 2019). Further,
oblique projections have been lauded outside of a mobile-content as a visual
storytelling technique for promoting voice and vantage point (Roth 2021) as
well as in critical cartography for confronting the ‘God trick’ or ‘view from
nowhere’ (after Haraway 1991) to present a view that is grounded from some-
where and someone (Kelly 2020; Underwood 2022).
Taken together, we need renewed research on oblique projections supporting
egocentrism in mobile use cases. For instance, WebGL-based tools can adjust the
pitch (0–90°) and bearing (+/ – 0–180°) of egocentric projections in addition to the
projection centering and scale (Jenny et al. 2015), but few empirically-derived or
time-tested recommendations exist for calibrating these novel settings for mobile
contexts. Further, pitch and bearing settings often modify an already projected
map render (often in Web Mercator even when using vector tiles) to speed
Figure 5. New York City (USA) in a ‘horizonless’ projection using the bendy-map interactive map
(adapted from Richardson 2018). While the non-mobile version (left) produces a line-bending/
mind-bending distortion reminiscent of the movie Inception, the mobile version (right) offers real
utility as a focus+context visualization portraying immediately local context (assuming the user’s
location is in Lower Manhattan) through an oblique, egocentric projection and more distance but
potentially important wayfinding information through a more conventional, planimetric map
projection.

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 429
performance on the mobile device, and may impose undesired distortions in the
resulting map or visualization requiring alternatives that better balance perfor-
mance with accuracy. The projection also may blend aspects of egocentrism and
allocentrism (a view from multiple perspectives), such as plan oblique projections
showing the ground plane in correct scale but relief in an oblique-like side view
(Jenny and Patterson 2007), or composite projections of multiple pitch angles
across the map based on distance from the user, starting from a steep angle and
tapering towards a more traditional, planimetric map to produce the ‘horizonless’
focus+context projection distortion effect found in the movie Inception
(Richardson 2018; Figure 5). In all scenarios, egocentric oblique projections may
need additional depth cues (e.g., Çöltekin et al. 2016; Kubíček et al. 2017), distance
scales (e.g., Halik 2012; Halik and Medyńska-Gulij 2017; Bartling et al. 2021), and
environmental signage (e.g., Soh and Smith-Jackson 2004; Nestel 2019b) to sup-
port a wider range of map use tasks.
Finally, it is unclear how oblique projections should respond from mobile to
non-mobile devices. Default oblique projections have become common on non-
mobile web maps for a stylistic ‘tilt-shift’ effect even when the perspective does
not serve the map purpose, but a responsive oblique projection may be helpful
for the aforementioned purpose of visual storytelling or inclusive design prac-
tices to support users who are unable to visit the mapped locations physically
due to access, disabilities, or inconvenience (Roth 2019a). Potential responsive
solutions may draw from existing solutions for virtual field trips supporting
situated learning (see Armstrong and Bennett 2005 for a synthesis and review),
such as pre-recorded flythroughs (e.g., Harrower and Seesley 2007), video gam-
ing technology (e.g., Bursztyn et al. 2015), and immersive and augmented reality
(e.g., Mead et al. 2019).
While egocentrism directly impacts map projections on mobile devices,
supporting egocentrism also may impact a range of other design decisions,
such symbolization of the self (going beyond the ‘reassuring blue dot’ symbol to
encode additional dimensions of the self and its movement; Peterson 2014) and
interaction with the map (including avatar-based embodied interactions dis-
cussed below; Thorn 2018).
Should projection selection adapt to device aspect ratio, space efficiency,
orientation, and other dimensions of the mobile use context?
In static mapping, the projection and projection parameters often are
determined by the map scale and extent undergoing projection as well as
the map properties preserved or distorted as a result of the projection
(Snyder 1987; Kessler and Battersby 2019). Conventionally in smaller-scale
regional maps, for instance, normal cylindrical-, conic-, and planar-class
projections are matched with equatorial, mid-latitude, and polar regions,
respectively, using a secant case to align standard lines (i.e., where there is

430 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
no distortion) with the mapped geography (Kraak et al. 2020). Similarly,
conformal projections like Mercator are paired with reference maps to
maintain angles at infinitely small points (an approximation of shape) to
support orientation, feature identification, and navigation while equivalent
projections are paired with most thematic map types (e.g., choropleth, dot
density, heat maps, shaded isoline) to preserve the relative sizes of symbols
to support general map reading tasks (after Battersby, Strebe, and Finn
2017). Šavrič, Jenny, and Jenny (2016), Finn et al. (2017), and Jenny et al.
(2017) provided useful resources for arriving at an acceptable projection
based on the desired scale/extent and preserved map property, and Jenny
(2012) implemented these guidelines to flexibility adapt the map projection
as users dynamically pan and zoom across scales and extents.
Arguably, the mobile use context should be a third consideration for
choosing a projection and projection parameters. First, mobile maps and
visualizations benefit if they match their aspect ratio – or relationship to the
horizontal and vertical axes, different from projection ‘aspect’ used above –
to the screen aspect ratio, allowing the map or visualization to be as large
on the screen as possible. Abraham (2019) found that aspect ratio varies
considerably across mobile devices with a general trend of becoming more
elongated and therefore more of a constraint on the design of mobile maps
and visualizations. Projection aspect ratio is gaining increased attention in
cartography and visualization, as it also impacts visual balance and user
preference (e.g., Šavric et al. 2015; Jansen 2019), and similar decision logics
as Jenny’s (2012) solution for multiscale web map projections based on
scale and extent can be extended for fully responsive web map projections
based on screen size and aspect ratio. Second, small screen viewing may
benefit from map projections with an increased space efficiency, or the
percentage of map versus non-map within a bounding rectangle (Huffman
2019), here the viewport of the mobile device. Jansen (2019) provides a
useful web utility for visually comparing aspect ratio versus space efficiency
to aid in projection selection for small scale maps (Figure 6). Third, the map
projection also may respond to the device orientation, switching from a
normal to transverse aspect or changing projections altogether to optimize
use of the small screen. While unconventional for thematic world maps,
transverse projections may be particularly useful for visual storytelling and
data journalism on mobile devices (as discussed below as part of mobile
thematic cartography), aligning a portrait map orientation with the vertical
scroll (Figure 7). Finally, many specialty projections may have increased
value for mobile maps and visualizations, such as the gnomonic projection
for placing a straight great circle between an origin and destination during
wayfinding or the equivalent dymaxion projection for tessellating multiscale
thematic maps using triangular tilesets instead of the square tiles common
to the Web Mercator.

Figure 6. A comparison of projections by aspect ratio and space efficiency (adapted from Jansen
2019). The Eckert IV (top; used in Figure 2) and Molleweide (bottom; used in Figure 7) projections
are equal-area, pseudocylindrical projections, and therefore are recommended for thematic maps
at a regional or world scale. While both projections have an aspect ratio of 20 (2:1 width:height).,
the Eckert IV has a slightly higher space efficiency than the Molleweide (0.90925 versus 0.88539),
resulting in the Eckert IV reserving roughly 2.5% more screen real-estate for the mobile map (each
projection footprint is portrayed in light gray within the above charts). Thus, Eckert IV has an
advantage over Molleweide for mobile-first projections and thematic map design, at least when
viewing the map horizontally (see Figure 7). Jansen provides a useful web utility for visually
comparing the aspect ratio and space efficiency of many projections, which could serve as the basis
for a mobile-first design strategy that is responsive to the unique screen size of the user’s phone.

432 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
Figure 7. Responsive map orientation (adapted from Bostock 2020). Most world maps are
projected into landscape orientations by default, reinforcing ‘north-as-up’ as a design construct.
However, a transverse aspect for cylindrical and pseudocylindrical projections may be acceptable in
mobile contexts where egocentrism is expected, and have the advantage of making more efficient
use of the screen space. Thus, the rounded corners of the Molleweide projection (shown here) has
an advantage over the blockier corners of the Eckert IV (see Figure 6) when adapting from a normal
(left) to transverse (right) aspect, particularly in the context of visual storytelling and data
journalism where smartphone reorientation to a portrait aspect ratio is expected.
What focus+context visualization techniques are useful for mobile first
cartographic design?
A key challenge in designing egocentric mobile maps and visualizations at the vista
scale, including those that leverage AR and MR, is providing necessary overview
information beyond the spatial extent currently visible onscreen. A number of ‘repro-
jection’ techniques have been developed in information visualization to provide
simultaneous general overview and local detail, solutions described as focus+context
visualizations (see Hauser 2006 for a synthesis and review). Focus+context techniques
may be useful alternatives to oblique map projections for supporting egocentrism
(Chittaro 2006), but are far less common in mobile maps (Abraham 2019). Ware (2021)
organizes focus+context visualizations into four categories: distortion techniques,
rapid zooming techniques, elision techniques, and multiple windows. Each class of
focus+context techniques could be applicable for mobile maps and visualizations to
optimize context information portrayed on small screens.
Distortion techniques are the most conceptually similar to map projections –
or more specifically, contiguous cartograms – and manipulate the spatial

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 433
configuration of map features so that more space is allocated to the local area of
interest and less to regions further away (Furnas 1986). The circular fisheye lens
or magnifying glass is perhaps the most common focus+context distortion
technique (see Harrie, Sarjakoski, and Lehto 2002, for map examples; Rappo,
Cecconi, and Burghardt 2004; Edwardes, Burghardt, and Weibel 2005; Wu 2016),
but a variety of spatial distortions may be useful depending on the user’s task,
such as the aforementioned Inception effect (Figure 5) as well as linearization of
a route into a schematized strip map (MacEachren 1986; Klippel et al. 2005).
When moving, the logical centering of a fisheye or other distortion is on the
user’s location to present local context in detail. However, focus+context dis-
tortions may be helpful for mobile maps and visualizations to make more
efficient use of the small screen, presenting an open mobile interface design
challenge given the lack of hover affordances on most touch-based, post-WIMP
interfaces (Yamamoto, Ozeki, and Takahashi 2009).
Additional focus+context techniques perhaps are more alternative design
solutions to egocentric projections than projections in themselves. Rapid
zooming techniques alternate between map scales (i.e., zoom levels) to
support ‘macro-micro’ map readings (Pearce 2008, 24; citing Tufte 1990,
37), often with smooth transitions between scales to maintain orientation in
the map or visualization. While most mobile maps and visualizations enable
panning and zooming interaction operators (see below), there may be
discoverable break points in map use where the system should trigger
these interactions automatically, such as when starting and stopping, chan-
ging direction, or reaching waypoints. Elision techniques hide rather than
distort portions of the context display until they shift into focus, a design
solution consistent with Zipf (2002) and Zipf and Richter (2002) use of early
‘focus maps’ for mobile cartography. Elided areas may be deleted (an
application of the selection generalization operator) or rendered with trans-
parency or other style reduction to produce a perceptual depth of field
inconsistent with the projected perspective. Alternatively, focus areas may
receive visual accenting such as highlighting using a high-contrasting color,
contouring the outline of features, increasing the level of detail, or animat-
ing using blinking or jittering (Reichenbacher 2005; Robinson 2011). A key
issue with elision techniques – and focus+context visualizations generally –
is delineating what should be treated as focus versus context information in
a given use case scenario (Fuchs, Kreuseler, and Schumann 2004). Finally,
multiple windows split focus and context into separate displays, a solution
that may not be feasible for small screens unless linking multiple devices
with cross-device interaction, as discussed below. However, an extension to
multiple windows may be the symbolization of information currently off-
screen around the outer frame of the mobile map or visualization, using the
visual variables or POI icons to provide a visual preview of attribute and
spatial information for important offscreen features (e.g., Burigat and

434 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
Chittaro 2008; Li et al. 2014). Thus, we need future research to explore the
relative advantages and limitations of focus+context techniques for mobile
maps and visualizations.
Mobile-first and responsive symbolization and visual hierarchy
How can mobile-first symbolization be energy-aware?
Energy-aware design intentionally balances the quality of the user experience with
the energy output of a digital tool, with the goal of remaining useful while mini-
mizing the carbon footprint (Wang, Lin, and North 2012; Han, Wu, and Roth 2021).
Energy-aware design aligns with the broader green computing movement that
encourages efficient creation, use, and disposal of computing resources to reduce
carbon emissions and mitigate climate change (e.g., Griggs et al. 2013; Biermann,
Kanie, and Kim 2017). Wu et al. (2024) estimate that the annual global energy
required just to display Google Maps (not considering data collection, storage,
transmission, etc.) was approximately 820.9 million kWh, which is equivalent to
the total amount of electricity consumed by 255,538 ‘average’ people in 2021 or
410.4 million kgCO2e in greenhouse gases. Accordingly, even marginal reductions
in energy consumption through intentional energy-aware cartographic design can
have meaningful effects when accumulated across all global users. While we need
robust considerations for energy consumption for both mobile and non-mobile
maps and visualizations, energy-aware design is particularly pertinent to a mobile
context given the added benefit of preserving battery life (Roth et al. 2018).
Energy-aware design potentially relates to all of the topics in the Figure 1
design space (see Wu et al. 2024 for a more comprehensive treatment of energy-
aware design for green cartography and visualization), and green computing
more broadly also presents technical challenges regarding the greening of
computing infrastructure and services (e.g., Webb 2008) as well as socio-cogni-
tive challenges the greening of individual attitudes and behaviors towards the
use of computing infrastructure and services (e.g., Dalvi-Esfahani et al. 2020).
However, research and development on green cartography and visualization to-
date (e.g., Hoarau 2011; Han, Wu, and Roth 2021) primarily focus on the evalua-
tion and transfer of energy-aware color schemes that preserve the semantic
relationships of the original symbols through a ‘dimming’ mode (e.g., qualitative
versus sequential versus diverging color schemes), at the expense of breaking
from conventional uses of color in cartography (e.g., blue for water, green for
forest) (Figure 8). As a useful starting point, Chuang (2009) developed a method
for measuring the energy output of OLED screens that can be used to estimate
the energy saving of one color scheme over another. However, this model only
estimates the energy consumed by static images, and we need additional
methods for measuring a dynamically changing screen while the user interacts
as well as the energy cost of other services and sensors utilized to render the

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 435
Figure 8. Energy-aware color schemes (adapted from Han, Wu, and Roth 2021). Considering the
energy consumed by a given mobile map is important for both preserving battery life for a specific
user as well as reducing the collective carbon footprint across all users. Screen brightness is a major
consideration for cartographic design, but many color schemes tested for print and non-mobile
applications do not hold up under extreme ‘dimming’ or ‘battery saver’ mode. The figure illustrates
how qualitative and sequential color schemes (after Brewer, Hatchard, and Harrower 2003; left
column) become largely ineffective under 60% dimming (middle column). Han et al., drawing from
designs concepts from Hoarau (2011), use a multi-constraint optimization model to adapt conven-
tional map color schemes for mobile viewing to account for reduced energy consumption and
variable environmental viewing conditions (right column). Future work is needed to extend research
on energy-aware color schemes to the other visual variables used in mobile maps and visualizations.
display. Chuang’s output model also needs to be extended to the more com-
mon mobile screen types, such as AMOLED and IPS LCD (Abraham 2019).
Adaptive color schemes are just one need for energy-aware symboliza-
tion, as each visual variable may have a different energy load just as they
have different visual levels of organization (see Bertin 1967/1983). For
instance, the use of grayscale proportional symbols using the visual variable
size may remain legible under more extreme energy reduction than chor-
opleth shading using color value steps. Further, the homogeneous color for
proportional symbols or large choropleth enumeration units may require
less energy to refresh the display when panned and zoomed compared to
other visual variables requiring precisely alternating light and dark edges,
such as orientation, texture, and even complex shapes used in iconic point
symbols. The ultimate payoff from this line of research is an updated visual

436 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
variable syntactics that accounts for both level of measurement (extending
MacEachren 1995) and level of energy output to inform green cartography
and visualization.
What is the role of imagery and realism in the mobile-first visual hierarchy?
The need for energy-aware symbolization is at odds with a major constraint of
the mobile context: variable environmental viewing conditions requiring
increased brightness and contrast within the visual hierarchy when displayed
against direct sunlight (van Tonder and Wesson 2009; Roth et al. 2018). One
proposed solution is imagery basemaps – which tend to be darker than simpli-
fied ‘street’ or vector basemaps – with map symbols and interface functionality
in a higher-contrasting, lighter color to use energy economically across the
display (Loeffler et al. 2021; see Figure 3d). Abraham (2019) found in a sample
of 36 commonly used mobile maps that 91% use a light basemap option and
only 25% had a dark basemap option such as imagery, a missed opportunity for
energy-aware design.
Imagery basemaps are mosaiced and orthorectified aerial or satellite images
(‘image maps’) converted into raster tilesets, often rendered at multiple scales
and resolutions, with the resulting basemap tending to have greater visual
complexity with more depth cues and visual occlusions (Dong et al. 2014).
Remote sensing as a set of technologies and voluminous data source has
transformed how cartographers work (Robinson et al. 1995; Kraak et al. 2020;
see Murphy 2014 for a synthesis and review), but imagery as a basemap versus a
data input disrupts conventional cartographic design considerations for estab-
lishing figure versus ground in the visual hierarchy (Tait 2018), and complicates
the purposes of abstraction versus realism in cartography and visualization
generally (MacEachren 1995). Geographic features captured in imagery com-
pete for visual figure in unintended or counterproductive ways without inten-
tional generalization, symbolization, and visual hierarchy, and therefore require
new design considerations when overlaid with vector linework, point symbols,
or labels to maintain organized hierarchy when imagery basemaps are used as
the bottom layer in so-called ‘hamburger’ web cartography (Roth 2019b).
As with the default scale and level of detail discussed above, empirical
research results are varied on the value of imagery basemaps on mobile maps
and visualizations. While a simplified vector basemap may increase efficiency of
identification and wayfinding tasks and lead to greater preference and con-
fidence with a general audience due to removal of visual clutter on the small
screen display (J. Dillemuth 2005; Davidson 2014; Bartling et al. 2021), a detailed
basemap with imagery offers greater clues for landmark association, appears
more accurate to general users, and could support a wider range of tasks
(Woodruff 2007; Niroumand-Jadidi, Helali, and Alesheikh 2011; Bartling et al.
2021). Further, imagery basemaps can be enhanced to enforce a more

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 437
consistent visual hierarchy among feature types through image processing
techniques such as histogram segmented stretching, co-occurrence based tex-
ture filtering, and Gaussian low-pass filtering (e.g., Dong et al. 2014) or visual
accenting techniques such as selective brightening, spotlight highlighting, light
beam guidance, semantic focusing, tilt shift focusing, glow segregation, and
visual downscaling (e.g., Murphy 2019). However, preliminary studies suggest
that hybrid basemaps containing imagery and vector overlays perform poorer
and are preferred less than their imagery or vector basemap counterparts
(Konečný et al. 2011; Bartling et al. 2021). Accordingly, we need future research
on existing and novel generalization, symbolization, and visual hierarchy design
techniques specific to imagery for mobile maps and visualizations. Finally,
mobile maps might also make use of near real-time cameras and sensors for
their basemaps as a form of augmented reality, requiring novel dynamic visua-
lization solutions to make sense of changing overlay information atop these live
basemap streams (Çöltekin 2019b; Çöltekin et al. 2020).
How can mobile map icons be crosscultural, plural, and inclusive?
Among the most common symbols used on mobile maps are point of interest
(POI) icons. In the same study referenced above, Abraham (2019) found that
94% of the sampled mobile maps utilized POI markers but only 31% and 33%
overlaid line or polygon symbols, respectively. Iconicity describes the degree to
which a sign vehicle (e.g., a graphic map symbol) looks like its referent (e.g., a
geographic feature) (MacEachren 1995), and map icons range from geometric
shapes that bear little resemblance to their reference (i.e., a large interpretative
distance) to pictorial designs that directly mimic their reference (Robinson et al.
1995). Further, associative icons resemble something associated with the refer-
ent that is easier to represent visually, but not the referent itself, and therefore
often reflect a particular cultural, ethnic, geographic, political, religious, and
sociodemographic context (Bell 2020; Kraak et al. 2020). Map icons typically are
designed as coherent icon libraries that work within a particular use and user
context (e.g., Dymon 2003; Kostelnick et al. 2008; Akella 2009; Robinson, Roth,
and MacEachren 2010; Bianchetti et al. 2012), but may not be legible to
audiences outside of this context.
Mobility exacerbates limitations of an impossibly ‘universal’ map icon library
(after Costanza-Chock 2020), and therefore necessitates new approaches to icon
design and cartographic design generally. Mobile map icons need to be con-
siderate of and adaptive to cross cultural contexts as the maps and visualiza-
tions in which they are placed move across borders with their users. When well-
designed, culturally-adaptive map icons may productively set expectations for
visitors and instruct how to move and behave respectfully in new spaces.
However, there is a range of lived experiences within any single setting that
reflect the different intersectional identities and the associated interlocking

438 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
systems of power and oppression (Nash 2008). Accordingly, data feminists have
called for designs that rethink binaries – moving behind icons that default to
‘straight, white, rich men’ in their symbolism (D’Ignazio and Klein 2016; quoted
in Kelly 2021, 548) – and that embrace pluralism – enabling diverse users to
assemble personalized icon libraries that reflect their subjective experiences
(D’Ignazio and Klein 2020). Three icon ‘modes’ may be useful while moving:
exoicons (after exonyms for place names, which draw from the cultural back-
grounds of the visitor), endoicons (after endonyms, which are community-
curated), and egoicons (after egocentrism, which are unique to the visitor’s
intersectional lived experience), with endoicons or egoicons displayed by
default (see the following section on toponymy for additional details). Further,
both the products and processes for icon design need to be more inclusive ‘to
empower a broader collective of mappers and designers, supporting icons that
relate to more people’ (Kelly 2021, 553), and thus many, layered sets of endoi-
cons may be necessary for any single place. Mobile maps and visualizations
potentially can serve as a platform for collecting and sharing plural, inclusive
designs either digitally or through georeferencing of sketches, signage, verbal
descriptions, etc. Ultimately, the icons are only as good as the underlying data
they represent, so the mobile platform also can be used to infill known gaps and
biases in open source, user-contributed geospatial databases to produce more
accessible and inclusive mobile maps and visualizations (Rice et al. 2013;
Stephens 2013).
What is mobile-first thematic map design?
Nearly all of the discussion in this section so far focuses on reference maps that
catalog the position of many different kinds of geographic features in the
landscape (e.g., POIs as discussed above), reflecting a current bias in the litera-
ture towards mobile maps that utilize location-based services for the purpose of
wayfinding. However, scoping mobile-first symbolization beyond cartography
to information visualization broadly (e.g., Lee et al. 2022) centers the need for
representing abstract statistical information in addition to location information,
revealing a pressing research and design gap for mobile-first and responsive
thematic maps that depict variation of one or several attributes across the
landscape. For instance, the cartographic canon prescribes a variety of thematic
map design decisions based on the use and user context – such as class breaks,
color schemes, scaling ratios … even the recommended thematic map type
altogether – with nearly all empirical or time-tested guidelines based on static
thematic map designs (Roth et al. 2017). Given the abrupt shift to interactive,
online, and mobile platforms, we need to examine which thematic map design
decisions should be fixed to the data (resulting in an intelligent thematic
cartography), the user (resulting in an interactive thematic cartography), and
the medium (resulting in a mobile-first thematic cartography), as well as when

Figure 9. Alternative thematic map types for mobile-first symbolization (adapted from Gorte and
Degbelo 2022). Conventional thematic maps may be suboptimal for mobile, as a larger default
cartographic scale and egocentric design may truncate a large portion of the mapped data. For
instance, the current view may be entirely composed of a single color in mobile choropleth maps
(A), leading to confusion about the symbol meaning and causing occlusion of any basemap
information. Further, a proportional symbol may become disassociated from the enumeration unit
border for mobile proportional symbol maps (B), leading to misinterpretation of the symbol as a
point feature rather than the polygon centroid. Gorte and Degbelo proposed ‘choriented’ maps (C)
that redundantly encode information using color value (the primary visual variable used in
choropleth maps), orientation, texture, and transparency. The choriented symbol also can be
applied as points (D) for mobile symbolization and interaction.
they need to be responsive across these contexts (Roth 2019b). Further, it may
be fruitful to experiment with inventive, non-traditional ways of combining the
visual variables to optimize information complexity on dynamic mobile displays,
such as the recently proposed choriented maps for mobile that redundantly use
orientation, transparency, and color (Gorte and Degbelo 2022; Figure 9).
Mobile-first thematic map design relates to at least two transformative design
trends impacting the practice of cartography and information visualization. First,
mobile-first thematic maps and statistical visualizations increasingly are employed
by data journalists as individual frames in a broader news story (Gray, Chambers,
and Bounegru 2012; Wallace 2016; Cairo 2017). Visual storytelling describes stories
communicated through illustrations, graphics, imagery, and video instead of or in
addition to oral, written, and audio formats (Segel and Heer 2010; Caquard and
Cartwright 2014), with data-driven visual stories combining quantitative and
qualitative visualizations with text and other story content into an often linear
sequence to make the presentation more intuitive, compelling, and relatable than
text or individual maps and visualizations alone (Gershon and Page 2001; Riche
et al. 2018). Mobile devices may be particularly adept at supporting specific kinds
of visual storytelling genres – defined by the visual or interactive technique used
to enforce linearity in the narrative sequence – and visual storytelling tropes – or
visual design techniques applied not to represent data, but to advance the
narrative and its elements (see Roth 2021 for a synthesis and review).

For instance, mobile news consumption is driving pervasiveness of the long-
form infographic genre, often described as ‘scrollytelling’ (Stolper et al. 2016), as
the vertical arrangement of text, images, and graphics matches the vertical
orientation of the mobile device when browser scrolling with touchscreens.
While most longform infographics can be viewed on both mobile and non-
mobile devices, newsrooms have experimented with a number of ways to
reduce visual and interactive complexity for mobile, such as converting: an
interactive thematic map or large series of static maps into an animated gif,
an animated thematic map into a smaller set of static maps, a bivariate thematic
map into a series of univariate maps, and a univariate map into a series of maps
individually showing each thematic class (expanded from Horak et al. 2022);
these responsive thematic map design solutions, and many others, remain
untested. Further, the personalized story map genre often assumes a mobile
use case, with users uploading text, photos, or videos georeferenced through
the mobile device’s GPS receiver as story events unfold. Regardless of the genre,
mobile viewing enables the visual story to be tailored to the user’s situated
context and also supports users to contribute their own voice into the story, a
powerful visual storytelling trope (see Pearce 2009, 2014) currently under-
theorized for mobile. Despite their wide popular uptake, minimal empirical
research or design discussion on visual storytelling explicitly considers mobile
viewing (see Lee et al. 2018; Tabassum 2021, for counterexamples). Further,
while mobile-first design affords many new opportunities for visual storytelling,
personalized storytelling exacerbates many of the aforementioned concerns
with mobile and the quantified self about privacy, surveillance, and
marginalization.
Second, mobile-first thematic maps and statistical visualizations increasing
are designed for viewing only at a moment’s glance, a use case pragmatically at
the opposite end of a visual attention continuum from visual storytelling.
Glanceable visualizations supply information quickly, often to support a second-
ary task when moving while attention is diverted from the primary task
(Matthews 2006). A map or visualization is considered ‘glanceable’ if viewed
completely within 500 milliseconds (Holcombe 2009) up to two seconds
(Blascheck et al. 2018) and at most five seconds (Gouveia et al. 2015), and
therefore glanceability requires simple representations designed for readily
accessible displays like smartwatches or digital dashboards that fill a specific
user need (Blascheck et al. 2022). Most examples of glanceable visualizations
utilize very basic chart types, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts (Islam
et al. 2020), suggesting that we first need to understand if and which types of
mobile-first thematic maps can be glanceable at all. However, glaceable the-
matic maps relate to Bertin (1967|1983) original distinction between the intui-
tive ‘maps to see’ that do not need consultation of a legend or other information
to be understood and the more complex ‘maps to read’ that require additional
description of the included symbols through labeling, annotation, legends, etc.

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 441
Notably, a shift towards glanceable thematic maps for mobile already may be
occurring, as Abraham (2019) found that 89% of the sampled mobile maps were
legendless. Thus, we need renewed investigation into Bertin’s levels of organi-
zation for visual attention (as expanded in MacEachren 1995) to establish
perceptual, semantic, and affective difference thresholds for each visual variable
and visual variable conjunction when employed for glanceable mobile maps
and visualizations (see Klettner 2019, 2020, for potentially related approaches).
How can non-visual, multimodal symbolization and interaction be used in
mobile maps?
‘Maps to see’ or ‘glanceable visualizations’ have the added benefit in their
simplicity of being more easily translated into non-visual and multimodal symbols
(Almeida 2011). There is an established body of explicitly cartographic research on
the design of multimodal interfaces that support multiple kinds of user input
instead of or in addition to graphical (i.e., visual) user interfaces (Golledge, Rice,
and Jacobson 2006). However, there is far less attention on how to use non-visual
methods for communicating geospatial information back to users, either as
updated map symbolization or interaction feedback (Roth 2013b). Alternative,
non-visual solutions supported by mobile devices include voice, gesture, and
gaze-based input modalities and haptic, sonic, and tactile output modalities
(Huang et al. 2018), with other sensory modalities such as scent or taste imagined
with fully-immersive mobile technology (Brule et al. 2016).
Understanding non-visual and multimodal symbolization is important for
mobile-first cartography and visualization for several reasons. The nature of a
moving device means that user attention often is split on other activities
(Reichenbacher 2001; Roth et al. 2018; Griffin et al. 2024), and thus non-visual,
multimodal symbolization techniques support peripheral (T. Miller and Stasko
2002) or ambient (Pousman and Stasko 2006) maps and visualizations designed
to supply non-essential or background information without diverting any visual
attention (i.e., not even requiring a glance). Further, non-visual and multimodal
symbolization and interaction are fundamental to realizing a truly inclusive
cartographic design, as modality translation and transcription services still
greatly underperform for maps and visualizations, mobile or otherwise (Cole
2021). Finally, non-visual, multimodal symbolization may support unique affec-
tive and emotional user experiences, with core concepts behind ambient and
peripheral visualization initially described as ‘calm technology’ (Weiser and
Brown 1996).
A reasonable starting point for research on non-visual, multimodal symboli-
zation and interaction is extension of Bertin (1967/1983; MacEachren’s (1995)
visual variable syntactics and DiBiase et al’s (1992.) dynamic visual variable
syntactics to other sensory modes. Krygier (1994) and Griffin (2001) provide
foundation work on sonic (e.g., location, loudness, pitch, register, timbre,

442 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
Figure 10. Multi-modal variables for mobile-first symbolization and interaction (adapted from
Roth 2017b). The visual variables are useful as a design framework not only because they articulate
the finite dimensions by which a graphic can be varied to encode information, but also because
their perceptual differences inform their application to data at different levels of measurement.
Static (Bertin 1967/1983; MacEachren 1995) and dynamic (DiBiase et al. 1992; MacEachren 1995)
visual variables therefore can be translated to sonic (Krygier 1994) or haptic (Griffin 2001) variables
according to level of measurement as a starting point for multimodal symbolization on mobile
devices. Note that the sonic and haptic variables currently are not evaluated for numerical data,
and therefore multimodal symbolization requires classification to convert numerical data to
ordinal classes. Importantly, the multimodal variable primitives also can be applied and translated
as affordances and feedback during interaction.
duration, rate of change, order, and attack/decay) and haptic (e.g., vibration,
flutter, pressure, temperature, resistance, friction, kinaesthetic location) primi-
tives respectively (Figure 10). We need research to update and expand these
primitive taxonomies to the capabilities of contemporary mobile devices,
including two-dimensional versus three-dimensional augmented reality
soundscapes (e.g., Schafer 1993). Further, we need additional research on the
effective translation of symbol primitives across visual, sonic, and haptic mod-
alities (Cole 2021). Useful insights for multimodal translation may be derived
through competitive analysis of existing tactile symbol sets developed for non-
sighted users and multimodal use (e.g., Lobben and Lawrence 2012). As support

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 443
for multimodal symbolization becomes increasingly possible with mobile
devices, perhaps the ultimate goal of this line of inquiry is creation of a
comprehensive syntactics of symbol primitives that is responsive not just to
the data level of measurement (as with the visual variable syntactics developed
by Bertin 1967/1983; MacEachren 1995) but also to the symbolization mode and
other aspects of the mobile use context.
Mobile-first and responsive toponymy and typography
How can mobile map labels be cross-cultural, plural, and inclusive?
The first key challenge with mobile-first labeling is determining which and how
many place names to display on the map as it moves across cultural, political,
and social boundaries. Mobile-first toponymy dovetails with the above discus-
sion on cross-cultural, plural, and inclusive symbolization, particularly in the role
of enabling multiple alternatives and balancing sensitivity with usability when
selecting endonyms, exonyms, and egonyms. The stakes with labels may be
higher than some POI icons, as toponyms and particularly oikonyms of inhabited
places often reinforce colonial or nationalistic histories and logics, and therefore
are as much literal text clarifications for map symbols as they are markers of
power and domination that cause real violence on communities as the maps are
distributed as mass-produced visual culture (Berg and Vuolteenaho 2009; Rose-
Redwood, Alderman, and Azaryahu 2010).
Accordingly, a cardinal concern of mobile-first labeling is the preservation of
endonyms when moving. Endonyms are essential to the cultural heritage of
Indigenous communities (Pearce 2008), yet, ‘The disappearance of Indigenous
languages is accelerating dramatically under the weight of the global dominance
of English and other major world languages [and] it is estimated that half of the
world’s 7,000 languages are expected to be extinct by 2100’ (Rose-Redwood and
Alderman 2011, 4, citing projected numbers from National Geographic).
Preservation of endonyms is a mobile-first cartographic design issue in at least
two ways. First, print and web map convention increasingly includes endonyms
alongside exonyms to balance sensitivity and usability, but such redundancy may
be unsuitable for smaller displays as the higher label density increases map
complexity and reduces search efficiency (Liao et al. 2019); therefore, a choice of
which label to include typically often must be made when adapting to mobile.
Second, many of the technologies unpinning mobile maps and visualizations are
proprietary, and thus have specific political economic interests that lead to the
commodification of place naming rights and the use of banal naming practices
where commodification is not lucrative to produce a neutral and ‘uncontestable’
landscape (Rose-Redwood and Alderman 2011, 3); cartographers therefore must
invest in participatory and collaborative projects to develop open source endo-
nym databases and co-develop processes that enable local and Indigenous

444 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
communities to retain ownership over this information. Relevant examples
include OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth, although even these efforts contain
demonstrated omissions and have received valid critiques for serving the interests
of the Global North (e.g., Stephens 2013; Peterson 2021).
Beyond preserving endonyms, mobile-first toponymy also needs to adapt to
different languages, character sets, and reading directions (see Kraak et al. 2020
for examples), yet there are minimal empirical research studies or compelling
design examples informing such responsive toponymy.
How should labels be placed on mobile maps and visualizations?
The second key challenge with mobile-first labeling is determining where selected
names should be placed on the map when viewing on a mobile small screen.
Much of the canon on label placement found in contemporary cartography
textbooks is derived from Imhof (1975), who drew from 150 years of professional
practice to establish labeling guidelines for print maps organized by point, line,
and area feature dimensionalities. While many of the overarching principles
remain relevant to mobile maps and visualizations – such as minimizing over-
printing to promote legibility and maintaining graphic association between the
label and symbol – many of the specific recommendations for point, line, and area
labeling have fallen out of practice for online and mobile maps and visualizations
due to the constraints of the mobile platform. A comprehensive update to Imhof’s
recommendations for labeling web rather than print maps is long overdue, yet
typography has been relegated to a relatively minor research topic in cartography
(see Guidero 2016, for an exception on label appearance that complements the
call here for research on label placement), with research instead emphasizing the
visualization of voluminous text documents on maps (i.e., turning labels and
descriptions into symbols).
Considering how each of Imhof’s (1975) print recommendations may
respond to the constraints of a mobile use case may serve as a useful baseline
for establishing mobile-first typography. For instance, Imhof recommends
slanted and gently curved labels for line and area features to promote graphic
association (i.e., the curve follows the primary trajectory of a line or major axis of
an area). However, slanted and especially curved text renders inconsistently in
web and mobile technology, and maintaining upright, horizontal text actually
may be preferable on mobile maps and visualizations as a visual cue when
rotating the handheld device to change the aspect ratio (Muehlenhaus 2013) or
switching to an egocentric, oblique projection (Loeffler et al. 2021). The smaller
screen size in particular is at odds with many of Imhof’s recommendations:
repeated labels for line features likely is unnecessary for any single map extent
on small screens, but labels for line and area features may need much more
frequent repeating when panning the extent. Similarly, increasing tracking for
area labels likely is not advisable as labels will more commonly stretch offscreen,

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 445
limiting legibility; area labels could even follow the user while panning if the
current map extent is still within the labeled area. Further, new label collision
detection algorithms may be needed to go beyond label+label or label+symbol
overprinting – as with the implementation of Imhof’s preferred positions in
mapping software (see Kern and Brewer 2008 for a synthesis and review) – and
in addition shift the label away from the edge of the small viewport while
panning and zooming to avoid truncated labels. Any adaptive relabeling
based on user interaction will have a performance and battery cost, so new
label placement solutions will need to balance legibility in the small display with
feasibility across a range of mobile devices.
Can labeling adapt to the user’s gaze?
A potential opportunity exists to clarify some of the aforementioned challenges
in mobile-first toponymy and typography by taking advantage of the user’s
gaze. Recent developments in machine learning now enable relatively reliable
eyetracking using the cameras found on smartphones without requiring any
additional sensors (Khamis, Alt, and Bulling 2018; Valliappan et al. 2020; Murali
and Çöltekin 2021). Gaze-contingent displays describe maps, visualizations, and
other digital applications that adapt content and styling to real-time eyetrack-
ing user data (Duchowski and Çöltekin 2007; Bektaş and Çöltekin 2018;
Duchowski 2018). While gaze-contigent displays have potential applications
for mobile-first generalization, symbolization, and interaction (Drewes, De
Luca, and Schmidt 2007; Huang et al. 2018), a particularly promising avenue
of research for mobile maps and visualizations is gaze-contingent labeling,
adapting the label content, density, and placement based on the user’s gaze.
Existing work on gaze-contingent labeling in cartography and visualization
includes adjusting the label density based on the user’s foveal center (e.g.,
dense or redundant labels) versus visual periphery (less or no labels) (Bektaş
et al. 2019) – a labeling solution based on the visual variable location that can be
extended to other visual variables applied to the label such as size, color, etc. –
as well as using historical user gaze patterns to refine label density and place-
ment (e.g., Giannopoulos, Kiefer, and Raubal 2012; Anagnostopoulos et al. 2017;
Kwok et al. 2019). Such systems also allow customized, even personalized
labeling solutions, such as removing place names that are very familiar and
therefore unnecessary to a user to make room for new, task-relevant
information.
Empirical research on gaze-contingent labeling remains in its infancy, sug-
gesting a number of open research questions. For instance, how can we further
improve the precision and therefore utility of mobile gaze detection without
processing and rendering latency or excessive draining of battery life? This
question is gaining interest in various interdisciplinary communities related to
mobile eyetracking, and it seems that there may be viable, unobtrusive

446 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
technological solutions available soon to enable previously unattainable
research and development on gaze-continent displays (e.g., Palazzi et al. 2018;
Figure 11). Further, what are the effects of gaze-contingent labeling on the
mobile user experience, and what are the best ways to design gaze-contingent
labeling to meet and even enhance the perceptual and cognitive abilities of the
users of mobile maps and visualizations? Research at the intersection of gaze-
contingent displays and aforementioned AR and MR technologies offer one
potentially promising path forward, extracting and adapting labels both the
surrounding, real environment and digital content layered atop this real scene
(e.g., Koulieris et al. 2018, 2019).
What role do text and audio messages play in mobile map and visualization
design?
A final challenge for mobile-first labeling is determining what textual informa-
tion should not be placed on the map, and instead (or in addition to) delivered
through popup text or audio messages. While used somewhat interchangeably,
a notification presents information about the current system state and use
context, such as a reminder on an upcoming turn or meeting, while an alert is

project uses mobile eyetracking and extended reality to create real-time, task-specific saliency maps.
DR(eye)VE uses a roof-mounted camera (top-left) to segment a video stream in real-time (top-right),
with the figure showing the extraction of humans and cars from other background information. The
driver’s gaze fixations (bottom-left) then can be combined with the video stream to great an
augmented or mixed reality display (bottom-right). While Palazzi et al. specifically developed DR
(eye)VE to study drivers’ focus of attention, future applications might include gaze-contingent
generalization, projection, symbolization, typography, and interaction.

triggered by a change to the system state and use context, such as an upcoming
traffic accident or wrong turn (Figure 12g).
Text and audio wayfinding notifications based on GPS directions are a
polarizing topic in cartography and visualization (Ishikawa 2019; Griffin et al.
2024), with many studies warning of the deleterious impact of automated
navigation assistant on spatial cognition and environmental knowledge acqui-
sition (Burnett and Lee 2005; Münzer et al. 2006; Ruginski et al. 2019). However
mobile users may prefer text instead of visuals when unfamiliar with the land-
scape (Zhu et al. 2022), and environmental learning may improve when notifica-
tions may include prompts to actively engage with the environment in addition
to turn-by-turn directions (Brügger, Richter, and Fabrikant 2017, 2019; Thrash
et al. 2019).
Beyond wayfinding, text and audio notifications and alerts likely play an
important role in managing split attention when using a map or visualization
while moving. Text and audio alerts may be helpful during unsafe or time-
sensitive user contexts to facilitate attention transition between the real-world
and the map or visualization (Roth et al. 2018). Alerts also may be useful in less
critical contexts to maintain baseline awareness of surroundings while deeply
focusing away from the map or visualization, a specific application of the
aforementioned ambient visualization sometimes described as casual visualiza-
tion (Pousman, Stasko, and Mateas 2007). Finally, supplying an alternative audio
landing page provides basic background about the guided tour and recommendations for
best mobile viewing. B: All website assets are cached to the browser from the landing page
so that students can download larger image and audio files while on campus wireless,
enabling offline viewing away from campus to prevent a cost to student data plans;
students begin the tour by clicking the ‘Go to the Map!’ button, setting the expectation
for all future UI widgets to use red as the primary visual affordance. C: A startup tooltip
highlights the first location on the tour, instructing students to click on the icon when
arriving at the site. D: Clicking the first site activates a dialog window covering the entire
viewport that contains information about the site; students either can read chunked story
text with images or listen to an audio recording of the text with descriptions for images. E:
A route is presented between sites to support wayfinding, along with a context point cloud
of additional landmarks to explore along the guided tour; at any time, the user can search
for their location (shown in blue), but an egocentric ‘tracking mode’ is not updated
continuously to preserve battery life while walking along the tour (versus driving or flying,
where charging is possible). F: Students capture notes for three critical thinking prompts at
each site regarding globalization – interdependencies, inequalities, and alternatives –
which are then compiled for their ‘visual essay’ assignment extending and enriching
Global Madison content with pictures and descriptions of their own reading of the land-
scape while completing the guided tour. G: Text and audio alerts are presented for unsafe
crossings and other important warnings identified from past iterations of the assignment.
H: Advanced functionality is minimized through a ‘hamburger’ menu placed at the bottom
of the display for thumb-based interaction. I: The guided tour is responsive for non-mobile
to support writing of the visual essay after completing the guided tour, with the non-
mobile map having a smaller default scale, geolocation deactivated, smaller icons and
typeface for non-touch pointing, and a persistent UI footprint at the top of the page typical
for Western reading.

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 449
option for text – whether for urgent text alerts and notifications or just con-
textual context broadly – improves accessibility for non-sighted users, and
therefore supports inclusive design (Roth et al. 2018; Figure 12d). As with
other research on mobile-first labeling, minimal empirical research studies or
compelling design examples informing such mobile-first notifications and
alerts.
Mobile-first and responsive user interaction
How do interaction operators and interaction strategies differ between
mobile and non-mobile maps and visualizations?
Representation design (e.g., the topics of scale/generalization, projections,
symbolization/visual hierarchy, and toponymy/typography treated so far in
this article) and interaction design increasingly are treated as complementary
needs for mobile-first UX in both research and practice (Buja, Cook, and Swayne
1996; Roth 2013b). Despite now numerous calls across the past quarter century
for expanded research on interactive maps and visualizations (e.g., Nyerges et al.
1995; MacEachren and Kraak 1997; Cartwright et al. 2001; Haklay 2010; Ricker,
Daniel, and Hedley 2014; Roth et al. 2017), ‘we have only just begun to scratch
the surface on formalizing the understanding of interaction needed to develop
interaction design guidelines’ (MacEachren 2013, 168). Further, the few empiri-
cal studies on interactive maps and visualizations tend to emphasize open-
ended exploration with large screen displays often showing multiple coordi-
nated views (e.g., MacEachren et al. 1998; Andrienko et al. 2002; Edsall 2003;
Robinson 2008; Çöltekin et al. 2009; Roth and MacEachren 2016; Vincent et al.
2019), meaning the results may be only tangentially useful for mobile-first
interaction design (see Savino et al. 2021 for a notable exception). Arguably,
however, it is interaction and not representation that more clearly distinguishes
mobile from non-mobile use cases because of the aforementioned possibility of
multimodal input and output and, in particular, the reliance on direct, touch-
based interaction over traditional indirect pointing devices like a mouse or
touchpad (Shneiderman and Plaisant 2020). Further, interaction potentially
can solve many of the constraints imposed by mobile technology, such as a
small screen and limited bandwidth, but too often adds unnecessarily complex-
ity that confuses rather than clarifies mobile maps and visualizations (Haklay
and Nivala 2010). Accordingly, mobile-first interaction design is among the most
pressing research gaps facing cartography and information visualization.
An important first step in understanding interaction, mobile-first or other-
wise, is articulating the basic interaction primitives available during design
(Thomas et al. 2005; Pike et al. 2009), a similar foundational framework that
the previously discussed visual, sonic, and haptic primitives serve for represen-
tation design. While cartography (e.g., Dykes 1997; MacEachren et al. 1999; Roth

450 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
2013a) and information visualization (e.g., Becker and Cleveland 1987; Buja,
Cook, and Swayne 1996; Yi et al. 2007) are beginning to coalesce around a
common set of interaction operators – or generic and repeatable ways to
manipulate a digital representation interactively (see Roth 2012; 2017a, for a
synthesis and review of operator primitive taxonomies for maps and visualiza-
tions) – these need to be expanded (or, for some operators, potentially con-
tracted) for mobile maps and visualizations as multi-touchscreen interfaces
afford a wider range of natural interactions congruent with the way humans
manipulate tangible objects in our surrounding environment (MacEachren et al.
2005). For instance, a number of touch interactions for manipulating the user’s
viewpoint, such as rotate from north-as-up and tilt into an oblique perspective,
typically fall under the blanket ‘reproject’ operator but arguably warrant treat-
ment as their own primitives in mobile-first interaction research and design
given the importance of egocentric projections (Sack 2013). While not specific to
mobile, Newbury et al. (2021) describe additional operators possible through
natural gesturing that may be useful on mobile devices, such as reveal hidden
maps features and link/unlink related features. Ultimately mobile-first interac-
tion requires reevaluation of work operators (i.e., those that accomplish a user’s
goal) versus enabling operators (i.e., supporting operators that can be con-
strained to improve efficiency) on maps and visualizations (after Whitefield
et al. 1993; Davies 1998), as traditionally enabling operators such add/delete,
annotate, edit, and share may be core to the mobile user experience.
Figure 13. Frequency of mobile interaction operators (adapted from Abraham 2019). Abraham
analyzed 36 of the most popular, English-language mobile mapping apps according to the
AndroidRank.org and SensorTower.org websites. The analysis revealed a number of trends and
gaps in how mobile apps employ data services, map representations, and, in particular, interactive
functionality. While emerging conventions are not appropriate in all mobile contexts, Abraham’s
analysis does provide a benchmark study for understanding the contemporary landscape of mobile
map UX and, by proxy, user expectations for mobile maps and visualizations.

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 451
A logical next step towards mobile-first interaction design is understanding how
users follow different interaction strategies between mobile and non-mobile use
cases in the type, frequency, and sequence of operators employed. Analyzing the
interaction operators implemented in existing mobile maps and visualizations
provides a look into potential interaction strategies of users, at least the interaction
strategies imagined by the designers. Abraham (2019) found several commonalities
between mobile and non-mobile (as compared to Roth et al. 2014) interactive
functionality, such as common inclusion of conventional ‘slippy map’ operators like
pan, zoom, retrieve, and overlay. However, Abraham found several notable differ-
ences (Figure 13), such as: increased support in mobile maps and visualizations for
the typically uncommon reproject and rotate operators (implemented in 47% and
61% of the mobile sample, respectively, perhaps due to the value of egocentric
projections) as well as the arrange operator (implemented in 53% of the mobile
sample, perhaps due to the increased demand of screen real-estate on mobile
displays); decreased support for some operators associated with exploration and
information-seeking (such as reexpress and resymbolize, found in 0% and 3% of the
mobile sample, respectively); general preference for search (72%) over filter (50%) in
the mobile sample, suggesting a lean towards non-specialists users with simpler
objectives; and increased support for enabling operators, particularly export sup-
plied in the form of a ‘share’ function (75%). Further, while repeated panning and
detail retrieval interaction sequences suggest that a user may be lost or confused on
both mobile (Bartling et al. 2021) and non-mobile (Roth and MacEachren 2016)
maps and visualizations, such suboptimal interaction sequences also might include
repeat zooming on mobile maps and visualizations, as the map scale may be better
tied to the mode of travel (i.e., speed, as discussed above) rather than determined
by the user interactively (Bartling et al. 2021).
Taken together, we need future empirical research on mobile versus non-
mobile interaction operators and interaction strategies to produce actionable
design insights for mobile maps and visualizations. While mobile eyetracking is
increasingly possible for research on environmental cognition and wayfinding (e.
g., Kiefer, Giannopoulos, and Raubal 2014), a key methodological barrier to
achieving this goal is disambiguating touch interactions with mobile maps and
visualizations and then integrate these interaction logs with eye tracking data
(Ooms, De Maeyer, and Fack 2014), particularly for mobile applications developed
through proprietary, third-party development tools (Savino et al. 2021). Thus, we
need open source solutions for mobile interaction logging supported by the
geospatial community to expedite future research on mobile-first interaction.
What is the efficacy of emerging user interface (UI) solutions for mobile
interaction operators?
A common distinction is made in the UX literature between the basic interaction
operators and the user interfaces (UIs) – graphical or multimodal – that

452 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
implement these operators (Beaudouin-Lafon 2004), with generalizable and
reproducible insights on interaction operators and strategies typically estab-
lished through controlled scientific experiments and transferable and contex-
tual insights on UI solutions triangulated through user-centerd design studies
on novel mobile maps and visualizations (Sedlmair, Meyer, and Munzner 2012;
Roth 2019a). Key to effective UIs is design of their affordances, or signals about
how to use the interface, and feedback, or signals about what happened as a
result of using the interface (Norman 1988), with affordances and feedback
forming the ‘glue’ in a two-way interaction exchange regardless of the sup-
ported operator.
Mobile devices supply an expanded range of design channels for UI affordances
and feedback, which, like multimodal symbolization discussed above (Figure 10),
might include voice, gesture, and gaze-based input modalities and haptic, sonic,
and tactile output modalities (Huang et al. 2018). However, mobile devices tend to
constrain visual affordances and feedback for interaction design because multi-
touchscreen interaction typically does not support a hover or ‘mouse-over’ state to
indicate if a feature is interactive. Industry conventions have driven a number of
intuitive, but untested direct manipulation operator+interface solutions that do not
include visual affordances (feedback is provided as changes to the map or visualiza-
tion), including single tap to retrieve map details, double tap or pinch to zoom in,
grab-and-drag to pan, two-finger twist to rotate, and two-finger scroll to tilt
(Muehlenhaus 2013). While these UI solutions are now commonplace on the mobile
platform, they still must be learned initially, leading to inefficiency and errors for
new users as well as the potential for some users to miss some or all supported
interactivity altogether (Roth and Harrower 2008). There also remain a number
interaction operators without conventional or intuitive direct manipulation pairings
(e.g., the lack of awareness of Google Maps’ double tap and scroll to zoom out;
PCMag 2016) or possible touch gestures that have not yet been combined with
interaction operators on maps (see Brehmer et al. 2022 for a review of design
studies containing direct manipulation touch strategies largely unapplied on maps).
Perhaps as a result, several recommendations and best practices have
emerged to add visual affordances and feedback to mobile-first interfaces
specifically or to increase the saliency of interactive features broadly.
Skeuomorphism, or UI designs that resemble their real-world counterparts, can
induce interaction with a feature and even suggest how the map or visualization
may behave as a result of interaction (Page 2014). While skeuomorphism has
been critiqued in favor of ‘flat’ design, particularly for being excessively heavy-
handed on mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited, subtle use of
textures and shadowing can evoke a tactile metaphor that encourages interac-
tion, such as adding raised or depressed lines beneath a map symbol (e.g.,
Stevens, Robinson, and MacEachren 2013) or as part of a menu selection inter-
face (e.g., the classic ‘hamburger’ icon found in many responsive design frame-
works; Figure 12g). Even flat design can employ the visual variables consistently

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 453
to produce a visual grammar of what is and is not interactive that is learned
once by the user, such as making all interactive features a single color hue
elevated on the visual hierarchy (e.g., the use of red for interactive map symbols
and widgets in Roth et al. 2018; Figure 12b-h). Layout also increasingly is used as
a visual affordance: menus, buttons, sliders, and other interface widgets often
are arranged at the top or left of the layout on non-mobile maps and visualiza-
tions to conform to Western reading (i.e., so that key interactive features are
seen first when arriving at the map or visualization), but typically are reposi-
tioned to the bottom of the layout for mobile to be closer to the user’s thumbs,
improving efficiency on handheld mobile devices (Kraak et al. 2020). As a result,
there are a growing array of explicitly mobile-first interface widgets that draw
on thumb-primacy in UI (Loeffler et al. 2021), such as bottom navigation tabs
(Figure 3a-b, d, f-h), floating action buttons (Figure 3a-b, d), and pull-up menus
(Figure 3h, Figure 12h).
We need empirical research to understand the efficacy of these emerging
mobile-first interface design strategies for different interaction operators and
use cases. Implementing multiple interface solutions for a single operator empow-
ers users with flexibility to determine preferred strategies across mobile/non-
mobile platforms and user tasks (see Harrower and Seesley 2005; Schwab et al.
2019 for baseline research on panning and zooming flexibility that can be
expanded to other operators). The ultimate goal of this line of inquiry is under-
standing the relative advantages and disadvantages of each UI technique and
then building interface flexibility from this understanding to account for pitfalls of
any single solution. Finally, the hover state may be supported on larger mobile
devices with a stylus or optical pen or smaller mobile devices through variable
force pressure sensitivity or even eyetracking much like gaze-aware labeling. Thus,
WIMP interfaces remain relevant to mobile-first interaction design, and we need
more domain needs assessments at the start of a user-centered design project to
determine the degree that multi-touchscreens pose actual constraints on visual
affordances and feedback (Robinson et al. 2005).
What mobile interaction operators can be performed through spatial,
tangible and embodied interaction?
Most of the above discussion considers mobile devices as a computing platform
for viewing and interacting with digital maps and visualizations, which they are.
Importantly, mobile devices also are physical objects in the real-world, and
afford a unique interaction modality beyond fixed, non-mobile devices: move-
ment of the device itself. Brehmer et al. (2022, 82) describe this quality of mobile
devices as spatial interaction and, in its simplest form, includes interactions with
the map or visualization based on changes detected by the GPS receiver when
physically carrying the mobile device through the landscape. Such spatial
interaction makes sense for operators that change the user’s viewpoint, such

454 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
as pan, zoom, and rotate, but may be extended with geofencing to activate an
interaction operator when reaching a specific location on the map rather than
requiring the user to manipulate the map as an added interaction (e.g., detail
retrieval when arriving at a POI or recalculation of a route when missing a turn).
Intentional changes in speed, direction, and elevation – as detected through the
mobile device’s accelerometer, compass, and barometer, respectively (Abraham
2019) – also may trigger different interaction operators. Geofencing and other
spatial interactions exacerbate privacy concerns as a form of passive or back-
ground collection of locational information as compared to other more active
and voluntary contributions (Wilson 2012; Roche 2020), and while some tech-
niques have been proposed to mask privacy during spatial interaction (e.g.,
Bareth 2012; Bohli et al. 2014; Bösch 2018), enforcement of government regula-
tions and professional standards remains complicated (Kerski 2016).
Beyond spatial movement, mobile devices increasingly are outfitted with
sensors that support tangible interaction, or interactions with a physical object
that transform digital information and renderings (Ishii and Ullmer 1997).
Tangible interfaces replace skeuomorphism and the idea of the ‘graphical’
user interfaces altogether, allowing the visual affordances and feedback of the
physical object (e.g., the perceived or anticipated size, weight, graspability,
portability, etc., of the device) to inform user interaction (Maher and Lee
2017). Regarding common mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, tangi-
ble interactions may: exert internal pressure onto the device through the multi-
touchscreen or other buttons, with different levels or lengths of pressure
executing different interaction operators (after Griffin 2001); change the exter-
nal, three-dimensional orientation of the device through rotating, tilting, shak-
ing, or throwing, as captured by the gyroscope (e.g., Dachselt and Buchholz
2009); drag an object across a surface, such as the aforementioned examples of
pen- or stylus-based WIMP interaction; or bring separate surfaces together in
support of, for instance, coordinated visualization and geocollaboration (e.g.,
Langner, Horak, and Dachselt 2017). Many of these embodied interactions work
at an operating system level on mobile devices, and thus are becoming more
familiar to users, but a range of inventive solutions can be imagined that directly
interact with the map or visualization, such as tilting and rotating to a landscape
aspect ratio to activate a menu of advanced options like filtering otherwise
deactivated during portrait viewing (Roth et al. 2018) or shaking and throwing
to filter without additional digital interfaces (Newbury et al. 2021).
Finally, new and emerging mobile platforms (as introduced below) are combin-
ing spatial and tangible interactions with new hardware to support embodied
interaction, enabling bodily movements of users to register within and affect
change to an immersive map or visualization (Dourish 2004; Newbury et al. 2021).
Embodiment is a crosscutting UX design challenge promoted across cognitive/
scientific (Kessell and Tversky 2006; Oulasvirta, Estlander, and Nurminen 2009) and
critical/feminist (Nold 2009; D’Ignazio and Klein 2016) approaches as a more useful,

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 455
meaningful, and inclusive interaction with maps and visualizations. The intersection
of cartography and video gaming (e.g., Ahlqvist 2011; Lammes and Wilmott 2018) is
a potentially fruitful avenue for researching embodied mobile interactions, as video
games often employ a virtual avatar whose bodily movements manipulate the
game space and overview map in complex ways beyond that found in typical
mobile maps and visualizations (Thorn 2018). Reverse-engineered avatar interac-
tions make sense for operators that change the user’s viewpoint like pan and rotate
(using the body, or what Meng 2005, 9, described as a ‘movable piece’, on the map),
but may be applicable for other operators as well. However, embodied interactions
raise new questions around disability and inclusivity, with any embodied interaction
strategy needing to be accessible to a full range of bodies and embodied abilities
(D’Ignazio and Klein 2020). At its best, embodied interactions with maps and
visualizations may enable users to experience the geographic places and processes
they otherwise could not access, making the user experience more robust for all
(Shum et al. 2016).
What new constraints, enablements, and consequences are possible with
emergent mobile platforms?
Finally, cartographers and visualization designers need to remain at the bleeding
edge of new mobile technology, continually testing our design frameworks and
recommendations against the constraints, enablements, and consequences of the
latest mobile platforms. Overemphasizing the technology de jour in research is risky
given the breakneck pace of technological change in the mapping industry, render-
ing some projects irrelevant before they can be published (Roth 2013b). However,
we argue that mobile represents a noteworthy exception to this rule given its
potentially transformative impact on society. Mobile platforms that appeared gim-
micky or niche only several years ago have become mainstream today as the mobile
technology industry grows to nearly five trillion USD worldwide (Okeleke and Suardi
2022). Cartographers have an important role to play in shaping the trajectory of
mobile technology because it is inherently spatial and geographic.
Emergent mobile platforms include wearable technologies that enable glance-
able viewing and embodied interaction, such as smartwatches, pedants, belts,
and even temporary tattoos with digital ink (Brehmer et al. 2022). Further, head-
mounted wearables such as glasses and headsets can support augmented and
mixed reality in the mobile environment, as introduced above, bridging mobile-
first design with cartographic research and practice on 3D, virtual, and immersive
environments (e.g., Çöltekin et al. 2016; Stachoň, Kubicek, and Herman 2020).
Beyond wearables, autonomous vehicles present a mobile use case that entirely
envelopes the body and requires high-definition displays and new interfaces to
keep humans in the loop to safely inform automated driving (Meng 2020), a
research and development need promoted as a top priority in the most recent
research agenda of the International Cartographic Association (Meng et al. 2021).

456 R. E. ROTH ET AL.
Finally, emerging mobile platforms increasingly support cross-device interac-
tion (Huang et al. 2018). Cross-device interaction includes a single user combining
interactions across multiple personal devices such as a smartwatch, smartphone,
and tablet – with one display controlling or coordinating with others (e.g.,
Langner, Horak, and Dachselt 2017; Horak et al. 2018) – or multiple users working
with one or several linked mobile devices, enabling social interaction when
moving (Dalton, Hölscher, and Montello 2019; Bae and Montello 2019) or dis-
tributed geocollaboration when fixed in place (Cheng et al. 2015; Brudy et al.
2018). Lagner et al. (2022) emphasize the social dimensions in their definition of
mobile visualization, yet the vast majority of existing research on mobile maps
and visualizations assumes a single user working privately, a clear research and
design need for mobile maps and visualizations moving forward.
Summary and outlook
In this article, we present a collective research agenda facing mobile-first
and responsive cartographic design. We begin by outlining a partial
design space for mobile-first and responsive maps and visualizations,
situating these design considerations within the constraints, enablements,
and consequences of mobile technology. We then present 20 research
challenges facing mobile-first and responsive cartography and visualiza-
tion, using the partial design space to propose potentially fruitful avenues
of future research to address these questions. Research challenges are
organized accordingly to five dimensions (i.e., sets of design decisions) of
the design space: (1) scale and generalization, (2) projections, (3) symbo-
lization, (4) toponymy and typography, and (5) user interaction. The
agenda crosses and organizes a range of research foci in cartography
and visualization – such as augmented/mixed reality, indoor/outdoor
mapping, egocentrism, focus+context techniques, energy-aware design,
glanceable visualization, visual storytelling, UI/UX design, multi-modal
and embodied interaction, and inclusive design – and we center concep-
tual, practical, and critical questions for design throughout.
While our focus in this article was explicitly on design, collectively working
through the research agenda illuminated a number of more meta-level
questions intersecting mobile-first and responsive cartographic design.
Questions include:
● What design topics are missing from the partial design space? Are there
any design considerations specific to mobile that are otherwise not rele-
vant to print or web cartography and visualization?
● What new emerging consequences arise as mobile-first and responsive carto-
graphic design evolves? How much of a map or visualization should be
responsive to mobile, and how do we evaluate the tradeoffs in selective

JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES 457
responsive design? When should a map or visualization explicitly not be
mobile?
● How should lessons learned from research and development in mobile-first
and responsive cartography and visualization be translated into educa-
tional and professional settings? How is learning or evaluation different
given that the students or users need to be situated in real-world environ-
ments to fully experience the mobile map or visualization?
● How should mobile maps and visualizations be archived to retain a design
record of our past that informs potential futures. Can such an archive be
platform independent?
● What is the role of cartographers in shaping mobile technology itself? What
benefits does our expertise hold for improving the mobile user experience
beyond maps and visualizations themselves?
More maps are viewed on mobile devices today than in any other format,
media, or platform, yet much of the cartographic canon we teach and
practice was established for the design of printed maps. In this article we
ask: How must cartographic design adapt to consider the mobile context first?
The promise of such research and development is a more useful and
inclusive user experience with mobile maps and visualizations, and ulti-
mately a deeper and more meaningful engagement with places as we
move through them.

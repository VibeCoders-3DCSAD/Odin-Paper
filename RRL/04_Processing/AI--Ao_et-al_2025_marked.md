ABSTRACT Time series data, capturing the evolution of specific variables over time, underpins critical
forecasting tasks across diverse domains. While traditional models struggle with the inherent complexity
(nonlinearity, non-stationarity, seasonality) of real-world time series, deep learning (DL) has emerged as
a transformative solution, leveraging its prowess in nonlinear modeling and automated feature extraction.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in DL-based time series prediction
models. We systematically analyze the characteristics, strengths, and limitations of prominent model
families, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (e.g.,
LSTM, GRU), Transformer variants (e.g., Informer, Autoformer, iTransformer), Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), and hybrid models. On this basis, we establish a structured, task-oriented framework for model
selection and cross-comparison, evaluating these models across essential dimensions such as sequence length
handling, multivariate support, interpretability, computational efficiency, and real-time performance. Finally,
addressing the challenges and issues faced by deep learning in time series prediction, this paper prospects
future research directions, including enhancing model interpretability, optimizing model structures, and
integrating multi-source data and domain knowledge.

I. INTRODUCTION
Time series data, a collection of data points arranged in
chronological order, reflects the trend of specific variables
changing over time [1], [2]. With the rapid development
of information technology, time series data has experienced
explosive growth in fields such as finance, meteorology,
industry, transportation and healthcare, including examples
like stock price trends, temperature and precipitation changes,
equipment condition monitoring, traffic flow statistics, and
forecast patient vital signs [3], [4], [5]. Accurately predicting
the future trends of time series data is of great significance
for decision-making, resource optimization, and risk early
warning. Consequently, time series prediction has become a
significant research focus in both academia and industry.

The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and

approving it for publication was Wei Xu

.

Several traditional time series prediction techniques, like
the ARIMA model and its variants, have demonstrated their
efficacy in dealing with linear and stationary time series data
and have managed to attain some degree of success. [6].
However, real-world time series data often exhibit complex
characteristics such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and sea-
sonality. Traditional methods show significant limitations in
processing such data, as they struggle to capture deep-level
patterns, leading to insufficient prediction accuracy.

Over the past few years, deep learning technology has
achieved remarkable breakthroughs in areas like image
recognition and natural
language processing, and it has
started to be utilized in time series prediction tasks [7], [8].
Deep learning models, through their multi-layer neural net-
work architectures, can automatically learn complex features
and dependencies in time series data, thereby effectively
handling nonlinear and non-stationary data and significantly
improving prediction accuracy and stability.

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

This paper first systematically discusses the problem of
time series prediction, then reviews related research methods,
and provides a detailed analysis and comparison of deep
learning-based approaches according to different network
types. Finally, the paper prospects the future development
directions of time series prediction technology, including
enhancing model interpretability, optimizing network struc-
tures, and integrating multi-source data. This paper aspires to
offer valuable references for researchers in relevant fields and
to facilitate the further advancement and application of deep
learning technology in time series prediction.

From a formal definition perspective,

II. BASIC CONCEPTS AND RELATED WORK
A. CONCEPTS AND PROBLEM DEFINITION
Time series prediction refers to the task of forecasting future
values based on historical observed data using time series
models. Its core lies in analyzing time series data, identifying
patterns, trends, and periodic characteristics, and constructing
appropriate prediction models to achieve accurate forecasts.
the time series
prediction problem can be described as follows: Given an
original time series dataset, where each input is a set of
(cid:9) at time t, with
dynamic variables Xt = (cid:8)xt,1, xt,2 · · · , xt,k
k being the number of dynamic features. The output of the
model is the predicted label value yt . Typically, the input to
the model is a fixed-size set I = {Xt−m, . . . Xt }, representing
continuous time series data from time t-m to t; the output is a
set O = {yt+1, . . . yt+n}, representing the model’s predictions
for n consecutive time points after time t [9]. Here, the input
contains k variables, and the output consists of coherent
predicted values for n timestamps.

When performing time series prediction, the first step is to
collect and organize observed data with temporal character-
istics. These data can come from various fields, such as sales
over a period, temperature changes, stock prices, etc. From
the original time series data, valuable features are extracted
through feature engineering for effective use by the model.
Proper selection and construction of features can significantly
enhance the performance of the prediction model.

B. RELATED WORK
In recent years, with the explosive growth of deep learning
models in the field of time series forecasting, a substan-
tial body of related survey literature has emerged [3], [8],
[10]. These reviews systematically outline the evolutionary
trajectory of model architectures, their core principles, and
their applications in specific domains. However, analysis
of the existing literature reveals several critical research
gaps:

(1) A lack of practical model selection guidelines. Exist-
ing surveys tend to focus either on in-depth analysis of
single-category models (e.g., RNNs, Transformers) or pro-
vide enumerative descriptions of a broad range of models.
Yet,
they lack a systematic, application-oriented frame-
work for model selection and comparison. Consequently,

researchers and practitioners face significant challenges in
efficiently and effectively selecting appropriate models based
on intrinsic model properties, data characteristics, and task
requirements when tackling specific forecasting problems
long-
(e.g., short-term financial volatility prediction vs.
term power load forecasting vs. multivariate traffic flow
prediction).

(2) Insufficient cross-model comparative analysis and lim-
ited discussion on integration trends. While the strengths
and weaknesses of various models (CNN, RNN, Trans-
former, GNN) have been discussed,
there remains a
notable deficiency in deep cross-comparisons of their core
capabilities—such as capturing long/short-term dependen-
robustness to noise/non-
cies, computational efficiency,
stationarity/seasonality, and interpretability. Furthermore,
analysis of how recent model integrations and architec-
tural innovations (e.g., CNN-LSTM, TCN-Attention, GNN-
Transformer) address the inherent limitations of traditional
models remains underdeveloped.

(3) Inadequate coverage of strategies for emerging chal-
lenges. As application scenarios grow increasingly complex
and data scales expand, challenges like model interpretabil-
ity, computational efficiency optimization, few-shot learning,
online learning capabilities, and domain knowledge inte-
gration have become paramount. Existing surveys provide
insufficient systematic summarization of these emerging
challenges and targeted critiques of deep learning solutions
designed to address them.

The core contributions of this survey are:
(1) Establishing a structured, task-oriented analysis frame-
work for deep learning models. We not only elabo-
rate on the core principles and evolution of mainstream
models—including CNNs, RNNs (LSTM/GRU), Transform-
ers (Informer, Autoformer, etc.), and GNNs (Section III)—
but also place significant emphasis on conducting in-depth
comparative analysis and applicability assessments of these
models. This assessment is based on key time series charac-
teristics (e.g., dependency length, trend/seasonality strength,
inter-variable relationships, noise levels) and core task
requirements (e.g., forecasting horizon, real-time constraints,
interpretability needs).

(2) Providing in-depth discussions on model synergy and
innovation. Beyond analyzing the merits and drawbacks of
individual models, we focus on the design philosophy of
hybrid models and structural innovations (e.g., TCN, SCINet)
and critically examine their effectiveness in overcoming limi-
tations inherent to traditional models (e.g., gradient vanishing
in RNNs, computational complexity of Transformers).

(3) Placing significant emphasis on cutting-edge chal-
lenges and pragmatic solutions. We specifically focus on
and critique the latest research advances addressing critical
challenges,
interpretability (e.g., atten-
tion weight analysis), computational efficiency optimization
(e.g., sparse attention, model distillation), online/incremental
learning, and the integration of multi-source data and domain
knowledge.

III. TIME SERIES PREDICTION METHODS BASED ON
DEEP LEARNING
A. OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING
Time series prediction is a crucial technology for forecast-
ing future trends by analyzing historical data, and it is
widely applied in fields such as financial market analysis,
weather forecasting, and healthcare. With the continuous
advancement of data collection technologies, the scale and
complexity of time series data have significantly increased.
Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models
face numerous challenges when dealing with large-scale,
nonlinear data, such as high computational complexity and
difficulties in capturing nonlinear relationships within the
data [11]. Deep learning models, with their powerful nonlin-
ear modeling capabilities and automatic feature extraction,
have gradually become effective tools for addressing time
series prediction problems.

Deep learning models, particularly deep neural networks,
are valued for their capability to automatically extract
high-level features from data through multiple layers of
nonlinear transformations. Deep neural networks build repre-
sentations of historical time series features through multiple
nonlinear layers to uncover the internal patterns of time series
data. [12]. During the learning process of neural networks,
relevant historical time series information can be considered
as being encoded into hidden variables, which ultimately
become the output of these hidden variables and the current
input. For different application scenarios, various implemen-
tations of hidden layers are adopted in deep learning, leading
to the use of different neural network architectures. Through
research, deep learning-based methods have been categorized
systematically.

B. METHODS BASED ON CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL
NETWORKS
1) CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep
learning model particularly well-suited for image recogni-
tion and processing tasks. Their core strength lies in feature
extraction through convolutional layers and pooling layers.
CNNs perform convolution operations on input data using
sliding convolutional kernels, effectively extracting local
spatial features. By employing a weight-sharing strategy—
where the same convolutional kernel uses identical weight
parameters across different positions of the input—CNNs sig-
nificantly reduce the number of network parameters, thereby
improving computational efficiency [13].CNN consist of an
input layer, convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully con-
nected layers, and an output layer, as illustrated in Figure 1.
CNNs excel at extracting local spatial patterns through
convolutional filters and pooling operations, benefiting from
parameter sharing for efficiency and translation invariance.
However, standard CNNs often struggle to capture long-range
dependencies inherent in many time series and lack inherent
mechanisms to model temporal order explicitly.

FIGURE 1. Structure of one-dimensional convolutional network.

2) TCN
The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is an innovative
architecture that is based on convolutional neural networks.
Unlike traditional CNNs, TCN is able to capture long-term
dependencies in time series data by using dilated causal
convolutions and residual connections [14]. The core idea
of TCN is to expand the receptive field of convolutions to
capture long-range temporal dependencies while avoiding the
leakage of future information.

Dilated causal convolution is the core component of TCN,
combining the advantages of causal convolution and dilated
convolution [15]. However, a major drawback of causal con-
volution is that capturing long-range dependencies requires
either extremely deep networks or large filters, which signif-
icantly increases computational complexity. To address this
issue, TCN introduces dilated convolution, which expands the
receptive field by increasing the dilation factor (d) of the con-
volutional kernel. The structure of dilated causal convolution
is illustrated in Figure 2.

FIGURE 2. Structure of dilated causal convolution.

TCN Residual Block: As the depth of the network
increases, TCN training may face issues such as vanish-
ing or exploding gradients. To address this problem, TCN
introduces residual connections [16]. Residual connections
alleviate training difficulties in deep networks by directly
adding the input to the output, improving model stability and
convergence speed. The structure of a TCN residual block is
shown in Figure 3.

In summary, TCN adheres to two principles: the input and
output lengths produced by the network are the same, and no
future information is leaked. These principles are achieved

through the use of one-dimensional fully convolutional net-
works (1D FCN) and causal convolutions, as illustrated in the
figure above. The formula for TCN can be simplified as [17]:

TCN = 1D FCN + causal convolutions

3) OTHER CNN-BASED IMPROVED MODELS
In the field of time series prediction, many researchers have
improved traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
by incorporating specific application scenarios, proposing
various efficient CNN variants. These improved models sig-
nificantly enhance the performance of CNNs in time series
prediction tasks by introducing new network structures or
optimization strategies.

In 2017, Borovykh et al. [18] proposed an improved
CNN model
inspired by the WaveNet speech sequence
generation model. This model adopts the ReLU activation
function and parametric skip connections, simplifying the
structure. Experiments show that this model performs excep-
tionally well in financial time series prediction tasks, not
only simplifying the training process but also maintaining
high prediction accuracy in noisy data environments. This
improvement demonstrates the potential of convolutional net-
works in handling complex time series data.
As dataset sizes continue to grow,

traditional CNNs
face challenges in computational efficiency when process-
ing large-scale data. In 2017, Dong et al. [19] proposed an
improved model that combines CNN with the K-means clus-
tering algorithm. This model employs K-means clustering to
divide large datasets into smaller subsets of similar samples
and subsequently trains CNN models on each of these subsets
individually. This approach has shown excellent performance
in prediction tasks on million-scale power load datasets, sig-
nificantly improving computational efficiency and prediction
accuracy.

Liu et al. [20] proposed SCINet (Sample Convolution and
Interaction Network), which adopts a hierarchical convo-
lutional network structure. SCINet uses a binary tree-like
architecture to iteratively extract and aggregate features at
various time resolutions, thereby learning effective repre-
sentations that have improved predictability. Within each
SCI-Block, the time series is split into two parts. As the
depth of the binary tree grows,
the network is able to
extract more detailed temporal information. In this manner,
SCINet is capable of capturing both short-term and long-
term dependencies in time series data at the same time, which
leads to a substantial enhancement in prediction performance.

However, the method relies on a fixed hierarchical network
structure, which may lead to insufficient adaptability to com-
plex or dynamically changing time series.

4) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CNN-BASED ALGORITHMS
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their improved
variants have demonstrated excellent performance in time
series prediction tasks, particularly when the sample size is
sufficient, as they can effectively handle short-term prediction
tasks. A comparison analysis of CNN-based algorithms is
summarized in Table 1.

TABLE 1. Analysis of CNN-based algorithms.

CNN: Suitable for short-term time series prediction tasks,
especially in scenarios with prominent local features(e.g.,
ECG abnormality detection).

TCN: Suitable for long-sequence prediction tasks, capable
of capturing long-term dependencies(e.g.,long term forecast-
ing of urban power load).

WaveNet-CNN: Primarily applicable to audio and time
series generation tasks(e.g.,speech emotion synthesis), with
limited suitability for other types of time series prediction.

Kmeans-CNN: Suitable for large-scale time series pre-
diction tasks, effectively handling noise and complexity in
data(e.g., Smart grid abnormal power consumption detec-
tion).

SCINet: Suitable for time series prediction tasks with
significant seasonality and trends, capable of capturing
multi-scale temporal dependencies (e.g.,holiday retail sales
forecast).

Beyond the listed strengths and limitations, CNN variants

involve key trade-offs:

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

Long-range vs. Efficiency/Complexity: TCN and SCINet
address standard CNNs’ limited receptive field (TCN via
dilated convolutions, SCINet via hierarchical decomposi-
tion). However, this significantly increases model depth,
complexity, and computational cost, making them less effi-
cient and harder to train/tune than shallow CNNs.

for

local pattern extraction,

Automated Features vs. Interpretability/Specificity: While
powerful
the learned fea-
tures are often opaque. Models like SCINet (designed for
trends/seasonality) or K-means-CNN (dependent on cluster-
ing) risk poor generalization if data characteristics mismatch
their design assumptions, and offer limited insight into fea-
ture importance.

Selection Implication: Prioritize TCN/SCINet only if cap-
turing long-term/multi-scale dependencies is critical and
resources allow. Simpler CNNs or other models (e.g., RNNs
for moderate lengths) may be preferable for efficiency or
interpretability.

C. METHODS BASED ON RECURRENT NEURAL
NETWORKS
1) RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learn-
ing model proposed by Jordan in 1990, specifically designed
to handle data with temporal characteristics [21]. The design
philosophy of RNNs is based on the idea that ‘‘human cog-
nition relies on past experiences and memories,’’ enabling
them to process temporal dependencies in time series data
by memorizing historical information. Initially, RNNs saw
widespread application in natural language processing tasks,
like language modeling and machine translation. However,
they have also demonstrated outstanding performance in time
series prediction tasks, especially in scenarios that demand
the capture of long-term dependencies. The most basic struc-
ture of an RNN is shown in Figure 4, consisting of four
components: the input xi, the output yi, the hidden state hi,
and the RNN cell [22].

FIGURE 5. Structure of LSTM.

due to issues like vanishing gradients and exploding gra-
dients. In order to tackle this problem, Hochreiter et al.
introduced the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
back in 1997 [23]. LSTM is an extension of RNN that
effectively captures and stores long-term dependencies by
introducing a ‘‘gating mechanism.’’ LSTM can extract impor-
tant features from input data and retain this information
over extended periods, making it particularly effective in
long-term time series prediction tasks. The fundamental
structure of LSTM is composed of three gating units: the
Forget Gate, the Input Gate, and the Output Gate. These
gates are responsible for controlling the forgetting, updating,
and outputting of information, respectively. The structure of
LSTM is illustrated in Figure 5.

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is an improved model
proposed based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network. GRU retains the core idea of LSTM, i.e., cap-
turing long-term dependencies through gating mechanisms,
but its network structure is more simplified. GRU integrates
the ‘‘input gate’’ and ‘‘forget gate’’ of LSTM into a single
‘‘update gate’’ and adds a ‘‘reset gate’’ to manage the flow
of information. This design not only reduces the number
of model parameters and computational complexity but also
mitigates the vanishing and exploding gradient problems to
some extent. [24]. The structure of GRU [25] is shown in
Figure 6.

FIGURE 4. Structure of a simple RNN.

RNNs are naturally suited for sequential data by main-
taining a hidden state that acts as a memory of past inputs.
Standard RNNs process sequences step-by-step, allowing
them to model temporal order explicitly. However, they are
prone to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, which
severely limits their ability to capture long-term dependen-
cies.

FIGURE 6. Structure of GRU.

2) LSTM AND GRU: GATED ARCHITECTURES
While RNNs excel at processing time series data,
they
encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks overcome
the gradient limitations of RNNs through a sophisticated
gating mechanism (Forget Gate, Input Gate, Output Gate)

and a memory cell, enabling selective retention and updating
of information over long sequences. Gated Recurrent Units
(GRU) offer a streamlined alternative by merging the forget
and input gates into an update gate and introducing a reset
gate, reducing computational complexity while often achiev-
ing comparable performance to LSTM.

LSTM/GRU have been widely applied to various time
series forecasting tasks, including network traffic predic-
tion [26], power load forecasting [27], equipment failure
prediction [28], electric vehicle charging demand predic-
tion [29], traffic flow prediction [30], and e-commerce sales
forecasting during promotions [31], [32].

3) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RNN-BASED ALGORITHMS
Recurrent neural network-based algorithms have long been
essential methods for solving time series prediction tasks.
They are often embedded as modules in other algorithms
to achieve better prediction performance and served as the
primary models for time series data prediction before 2017,
with widespread applications. A comparison analysis of
RNN-based algorithms is summarized in Table 2.

TABLE 2. Analysis of RNN-based algorithms.

RNN: A foundational model suitable for short-term time
series prediction tasks, especially in scenarios with prominent
local features (e.g., short-term stock price fluctuations, sensor
data prediction). However, it struggles with long sequences
and gradient issues.

LSTM: Addresses RNN’s gradient problems through
gating mechanisms, making it suitable for long-sequence
prediction tasks (e.g., power load forecasting, weather data
prediction) where long-term dependencies need to be cap-
tured. Its drawbacks include high computational complexity.
for
small/medium-scale datasets or resource-constrained sce-
narios (e.g.,
traffic flow prediction, promotional sales
forecasting). While efficient, its performance may lag behind
LSTM in complex tasks.

GRU: A simplified version of LSTM,

ideal

The evolution from RNNs to LSTM/GRU involves funda-

mental trade-offs:

Memory vs. Cost/Parallelism: Gating mechanisms (LSTM’s
3 gates, GRU’s 2 gates) effectively solve the vanishing gra-
dient problem, enabling long-term memory. This comes at a
high computational cost per step and inherently sequential
processing, severely limiting training parallelism and speed
compared to CNNs/Transformers. GRU offers a lower-cost
alternative to LSTM with comparable performance in many
cases.

Flexibility vs. Overfitting/Data Hunger: Their general-
purpose sequential modeling capability is versatile. However,
this power increases overfitting risk (especially for smaller
datasets) and often demands more data than simpler models
to achieve robustness.

Selection Implication: Choose LSTM/GRU when mod-
eling order and causality is paramount for medium/long
dependencies, and sequential processing is acceptable. GRU
is often the pragmatic default; use LSTM if maximum rep-
resentational power is needed. Consider alternatives (TCN,
Transformer) for very long sequences or when parallel speed
is critical.

D. METHODS BASED ON TRANSFORMER
1) TRANSFORMER
The Transformer model was introduced by Vaswani et al. in
2017 and was initially utilized in natural language processing
tasks.Its core idea relies entirely on the Self-Attention Mech-
anism to capture long-range dependencies in sequences [33].
Unlike traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Transformer
discards recurrent and convolutional operations, depending
solely on attention mechanisms for sequence modeling. This
design not only significantly enhances parallel computing
capabilities but also enables processing of longer sequences
while dramatically improving training and inference
efficiency.

The overall architecture of the Transformer follows an
Encoder-Decoder framework [34], as illustrated in Figure 7.
Both the encoder and decoder consist of multiple stacked lay-
ers, each containing Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanisms
and Feed-Forward Neural Networks.

The Transformer architecture revolutionized sequence
modeling by relying solely on the self-attention mecha-
nism, dispensing with recurrence and convolution. This
allows it to capture long-range dependencies effectively and
enables massive parallelization during training. However, the
self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and space com-
plexity (O(L2)) with respect to sequence length L, posing a
significant challenge for very long time series forecasting.

2) INFORMER
While the Transformer model exhibits powerful sequence
modeling capabilities, its self-attention mechanism suffers
from quadratic growth in time and space complexity as

via a fully connected layer to generate the final prediction
outcomes.

3) AUTOFORMER
Prior to the proposal of Autoformer, Transformer-based
models primarily relied on self-attention mechanisms to cap-
ture long-term dependencies in sequences. However, when
handling complex time series data with long-term future hori-
zons, traditional Transformer models often struggle to effec-
tively capture reliable dependencies. Additionally, although
Informer improves the efficiency of long-sequence process-
ing through sparse self-attention mechanisms, its information
utilization still faces bottlenecks. To address these issues,
researchers proposed Autoformer, a novel architecture based
on an Auto-Correlation Mechanism and series decompo-
sition. Autoformer embeds series decomposition into the
model’s fundamental modules, endowing it with the capa-
bility for progressive decomposition of complex time series.
Simultaneously,
replaces the traditional self-attention
mechanism with the auto-correlation mechanism, signifi-
cantly enhancing information utilization efficiency [37]. The
overall structure of Autoformer is illustrated in Figure 9.

it

FIGURE 9. Structure of autoformer.

The encoder and decoder parts of Autoformer both
the auto-correlation mechanism,
include three modules:
series decomposition, and feed-forward networks. The
encoder focuses on modeling the seasonal components of
the sequence, and the output containing past seasonal com-
ponents is provided as cross-information to the decoder
for prediction processing. The decoder is mainly divided
into two parts: cumulative operations for the trend-cyclical
components and stacked auto-correlation mechanisms for
the seasonal components output by the encoder [38]. Each
decoder layer contains an inner auto-correlation mechanism
and an encoder-decoder auto-correlation mechanism, which
respectively help the model refine predictions and extract
seasonal characteristics from past sequences.

4) ITRANSFORMER
ITransformer was proposed by Liu et al. [39], iTransformer
fundamentally rethinks how multivariate time series are
processed within the Transformer framework. Unlike tra-
ditional approaches that treat time points as tokens and
variables as features (channel dimensions),
iTransformer
inverts the dimensions: it treats each variable as a token and
embeds the temporal points of that variable as the token’s

FIGURE 7. Structure of transformer.

limiting its effectiveness
the sequence length increases,
in long-sequence prediction tasks [35]. To address this,
researchers proposed the Informer model for long-sequence
forecasting. Informer introduces three key innovations:

ProbSparse Self-Attention Mechanism: Reduces the time
and space complexity from O( L2 ) to O(Llog L), where L is
the sequence length.

Self-Attention Distilling Mechanism: Shortens the input
sequence length by distilling dominant features, thereby
reducing computational and memory costs.

Generative-Style Decoder: Directly generates predictions
in a single forward step during inference, rather than using a
step-by-step autoregressive approach, significantly reducing
prediction time.

The overall architecture of the Informer model [36] is

illustrated in Figure 8.

FIGURE 8. Structure of informer.

The overall architecture of Informer retains the encoder-
decoder structure. The encoder is mainly made up of stacked
ProbSparse Self-Attention Layers and Self-Attention Distill-
ing Layers. The decoder is largely composed of ProbSparse
Self-Attention and Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanisms.
Lastly, the output from the decoder is further processed

features. The overall structure of iTransformer is illustrated
in Figure 10. Key innovations include:

FIGURE 10. Structure of iTransformer.

(a) Variable-as-Token: Each multivariate series is trans-
formed into a sequence of tokens, where each token repre-
sents one variable. The token embedding contains the entire
historical sequence of that single variable.

(b) Multivariate Self-Attention: The self-attention mech-
anism operates directly on these variable tokens, learning
the complex dependencies and interactions between dif-
ferent variables. This is a stark contrast to models using
channel-independent embeddings or simple concatenation.

(c) Temporal Modeling via Feed-Forward Networks
(FFNs): The powerful FFN layers within each Transformer
block are then responsible for modeling the intricate tempo-
ral patterns within each individual variable’s sequence. The
inverted structure allows the FFNs to focus solely on the
temporal dimension per variable.

iTransformer

leverages the Transformer’s token rela-
tionships and FFN’s non-linear fitting to effectively cap-
ture cross-variable correlations while maintaining temporal
modeling. It significantly outperforms models like Auto-
former/FEDformer [40] in multivariate forecasting due to
its simplicity. Gains are less pronounced on univariate
tasks, and it represents a paradigm shift prioritizing variable
dimensions.

5) OTHER TRANSFORMER-BASED METHODS
With the success of Transformer models in natural language
processing, an increasing number of studies have applied
them to time series prediction tasks [41]. Below are several
improved Transformer-based models and their applications in
time series prediction.

In 2020, Wu et al. [42] proposed the Adversarial Sparse
Transformer (AST). Based on Sparse Transformer [43], AST
incorporates ideas from Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) to enhance prediction performance through adver-
sarial training. AST adopts an encoder-decoder architecture,
enabling high-fidelity multi-step predictions at the sequence
level. Experiments show that dependencies between time
series steps exhibit sparsity, and AST improves prediction
performance globally through adversarial training. Compared
to traditional autoregressive decoders, the encoder-decoder-
based AST demonstrates superior accuracy and stability.

In 2023, Li et al. [44] proposed Conformer, a Trans-
former model tailored for multivariate long-period time series

prediction. Conformer extracts correlation features from mul-
tivariate time series using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
effectively modeling relationships between multiple vari-
ables and capturing patterns at different time scales (e.g.,
monthly, weekly, daily, hourly). To enhance long-period
prediction efficiency, Conformer employs a sliding window
method, where each position computes attention weights
only with neighboring nodes within the window, reducing
time complexity to O(L). Furthermore, Conformer introduces
stationary and instant recurrent network modules, encoding
input time series with GRU to compensate for global infor-
mation loss caused by the sliding window method, further
boosting prediction capabilities.

In 2023, Kim et al. proposed Scaleformer [45], it addresses
multi-scale temporal dependencies through a dual adap-
tive mechanism comprising: (1) scale-aware attention that
dynamically selects optimal attention granularity (e.g.,
hourly/daily/weekly bins), and (2) gated resource allocation
that learns to distribute computational resources between
local and global attention heads. This architecture represents
a significant advancement in computational efficiency for
ultra-long-horizon forecasting, though its predefined scale
bins may constrain adaptability to irregular temporal patterns.
In 2023, Zhang et al. developed CrossFormer [46]. Cross-
Former introduces a novel cross-scale attention mechanism
that explicitly models multi-periodicity through: (1) hier-
archical feature extraction at predefined temporal scales
(e.g.,24h/168h/720h), (2) learnable fusion of periodic compo-
nents via gating mechanisms, and (3) phase-aware alignment
for drifting seasonality. This architecture provides state-of-
the-art modeling of complex periodic patterns, though its
fixed scale definitions may limit effectiveness for irregularly
sampled or non-stationary time series.

6) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMER-BASED
ALGORITHMS
Transformer-based algorithms are now widely used in var-
ious artificial intelligence tasks. Building models on the
Transformer framework can break through the limitations
of traditional algorithms, enabling simultaneous capture of
short-term and long-term dependencies, effectively solving
long-sequence prediction challenges, and supporting paral-
lel processing. A comparison analysis of transformer-based
algorithms is summarized in Table 3.

Transformer-based algorithms have demonstrated remark-
able capabilities in long-range dependency modeling, though
they present distinct trade-offs. The Informer architecture
achieves efficient long-sequence processing through its Prob-
Sparse attention mechanism, while Autoformer enhances
periodicity modeling via series decomposition and auto-
correlation mechanisms. Newer variants address specific
limitations: iTransformer’s inverted architecture (channel-
independent processing) significantly improves multivari-
ate forecasting robustness but sacrifices short-term feature
sensitivity; Scaleformer’s adaptive computation allocation

maintains advantages in general sequence-to-sequence tasks
with moderate lengths.

Interpretability remains challenging across all Transformer
variants. While attention visualization offers partial insight,
models increasingly rely on post-hoc methods like SHAP [47]
and LIME [48] for feature attribution.

SHAP: A game-theoretic approach that assigns each fea-
ture (variable at a specific time) an importance value for a
particular prediction. It is highly valuable for quantifying the
contribution of different drivers in multivariate forecasts (e.g.,
‘‘What was the impact of temperature vs. humidity on the
predicted energy load?’’).

LIME: Approximates the complex model locally around a
specific prediction with a simpler, interpretable model (e.g.,
linear regression). This helps in understanding the model’s
behavior for individual forecasts (e.g., ‘‘Why did the model
predict a spike in traffic at this particular hour?’’).

E. METHODS BASED ON GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS
In multivariate time series forecasting, variables often exhibit
complex interdependencies that
traditional methods may
struggle to capture effectively. In recent years, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) [49] have demonstrated powerful capabil-
ities in modeling relational dependencies. GNNs address this
by representing time series data as graph structures, where
graph convolution operations capture spatial dependencies
between variables, and temporal convolution operations
model temporal dependencies within the sequences. This dual
mechanism enables effective prediction of multivariate time
series [50]. Recent advances further extend this paradigm
through spatiotemporal frameworks (e.g., MTGNN, STGCN)
that unify spatial and temporal modeling in an end-to-end
architecture. The basic framework of GNNs is illustrated in
Figure 11.

FIGURE 11. Structure of GNN.

optimizes ultra-long-horizon efficiency at the cost of prede-
fined scale constraints; CrossFormer provides state-of-the-art
multi-periodicity modeling through explicit cross-scale atten-
tion, though its fixed temporal bins limit irregular pattern
adaptability.

For applications requiring extreme sequence lengths
(>10,000 steps), Scaleformer currently provides the opti-
mal efficiency-accuracy balance. When handling high-
dimensional multivariate series with independent channels
(e.g., multi-sensor industrial systems), iTransformer demon-
strates superior noise robustness. CrossFormer excels in
domains with strong inherent periodicities (epidemiology,
energy demand), while the original Transformer architecture

1) MAIN CATEGORIES OF GRAPH NEURAL
NETWORK-BASED METHODS
(a) Spatial Graph Convolution-Based Methods

This approach utilizes graph convolution operations to cap-
ture spatial dependencies in time series data. By transforming
time series data into graph structures, graph convolution
propagates information across the graph, integrating features
from neighboring nodes. The advantage of spatial graph
convolution is its ability to effectively capture local spatial
dependencies, making it well-suited to data with explicit
spatial structures. However, it also has limitations, such as
lower computational efficiency for large-scale graph data and
challenges in handling dynamic graph structures.

VOLUME 13, 2025

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

(b) Temporal Convolution-Based Methods
Temporal convolution methods primarily focus on extract-
ing temporal dependencies through temporal convolution
modules. These methods excel at processing sequential infor-
mation in time series data and perform well in predicting data
with significant temporal dynamics. However, they may over-
look spatial dependencies in the data, leading to suboptimal
performance when dealing with complex spatial structures.

(c) Spatial-Temporal Integrated Methods
This approach constructs a spatiotemporal parallel feature
extraction framework that simultaneously considers both spa-
tial and temporal dependencies in time series data. For exam-
ple, emerging frameworks like STGCN (Spatio-Temporal
Graph Convolutional Network) and MTGNN (Multivariate
Time Series Graph Neural Network) jointly model spatial and
temporal dependencies through:

STGCN (Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network)
is a graph neural network framework specifically designed
for spatiotemporal data with fixed topology. Its core inno-
vation lies in the cascaded architecture of spatial-temporal
convolutions. The method adopts a sandwich structure (GCN-
TCN-GCN), where graph convolutional networks (GCN) in
the spatial dimension capture spatial dependencies between
nodes (e.g., connections between sensors in traffic networks),
while dilated causal convolutions (TCN) in the temporal
dimension extract multi-scale temporal features [51].

MTGNN (Multivariate Time Series Graph Neural Net-
work) is a graph neural network framework that is specifically
tailored for multivariate time series forecasting. Its core inno-
vation lies in end-to-end dynamic graph structure learning
and joint spatiotemporal dependency modeling. The method
automatically infers implicit relationships between variables
through trainable node embeddings, generating dynamic
adjacency matrices that overcome the limitations of tra-
ditional GNNs relying on prior knowledge. For temporal
modeling, MTGNN employs dilated causal convolution to
capture multi-scale temporal patterns, combined with gating
mechanisms to filter noise [52]

Compared to approaches that model spatial and tempo-
ral dependencies separately, these integrated methods often
demonstrate superior performance on benchmarks.

2) TIME SERIES PREDICTION RESEARCH BASED ON GRAPH
NEURAL NETWORKS
In recent years, the application of Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) in time series prediction has grown significantly, par-
ticularly in multivariate time series forecasting [53]. By mod-
eling spatial dependencies between variables, GNNs have
substantially improved prediction performance. An increas-
ing number of scholars are now applying GNNs to time series
prediction research.

Ariele and Brunod et al. [54] proposed a Graph Con-
volutional Recurrent Neural Network (GCRNN) to predict
water demand in supply systems within the same geo-
graphical region. This method constructs a graph structure

to link water demand time series across different regions,
capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies. Specifi-
cally, GCRNN integrates spatial information through graph
convolution operations and captures temporal dynamics via
recurrent neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that
GCRNN effectively predicts water demand, providing reli-
able support for water resource management.

Yu et al. proposed a deep learning framework based on
Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN)
for traffic flow forecasting. Addressing the issue that tradi-
tional methods struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal
dependencies in mid-to-long-term predictions, STGCN con-
structs a fully convolutional structure of spatio-temporal
convolution blocks by combining graph convolution with
gated temporal convolution, effectively integrating the topo-
logical
information of the traffic network and dynamic
temporal features. The research results verify the efficiency
and scalability of spatio-temporal graph convolution in traf-
fic prediction, providing a practical solution for intelligent
transportation systems.

Wu et al. proposed an end-to-end framework named
MTGNN for modeling dynamic spatio-temporal dependen-
cies. The innovation of this method lies in its ability to
automatically learn the dynamic graph structure among vari-
ables through trainable node embeddings, without the need
for a predefined adjacency matrix. It also captures multi-scale
temporal patterns by combining dilated causal convolution
with gating mechanisms. Experiments show that its training
efficiency and generalization ability are superior to traditional
graph neural networks, providing a general solution for mul-
tivariate time series prediction without explicit structure.

Lan et al. proposed a dynamic spatial-temporal(DSTAGNN)
aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the
predefined static graph commonly used in traditional graph
convolution. They considered that historical data contains
the intrinsic dynamic information of the road network’s
spatial structure. Additionally, the paper designed a new
graph neural network architecture. This architecture can
not only represent the dynamic spatial correlation between
nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism but
also capture extensive dynamic temporal correlation from
multi-receptive-field features through multi-scale gated con-
volution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show
that the performance of the proposed algorithm has been
improved [55].

HGCN-MA (Hierarchical Graph Convolution with Multi-
scale Attention) proposed by Wang et al. [56], this architec-
ture captures multi-granularity spatio-temporal dependencies
through three key innovations: (1) hierarchical graph pooling
and up-sampling operations that aggregate regional pat-
terns at different spatial resolutions, (2) multi-scale attention
mechanisms that dynamically fuse hourly, daily, and weekly
temporal features, and (3) adaptive edge weighting that mod-
els evolving relationships between nodes. This hierarchical
approach effectively captures regional-to-local dependen-
though its fixed pooling ratios

require careful hyperparameter tuning for optimal spatial
partitioning.

STAN (Spatio-Temporal Attention Network) developed
by Chen et al. [57], STAN introduces a dual-path isola-
tion framework featuring: (1) a spatial path using graph
isomorphism networks with edge gating to filter irrele-
vant connections, (2) a temporal path employing dilated
causal convolutions with adaptive receptive fields that auto-
matically adjust
to changing event durations, and (3) a
cross-attention fusion module that learns interaction weights
between spatio-temporal features. The dual-path isolation
provides exceptional modeling fidelity for critical phenom-
ena like natural disasters, though its multi-stage training
protocol demands significant computational resources.

3) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GNN-BASED ALGORITHMS
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful
tools for modeling relational dependencies in time series data.
By combining spatial and temporal modeling capabilities,
GNN-based methods offer unique advantages for various
prediction tasks. A comparative analysis of three key GNN
approaches is summarized in Table 4.

approaches (e.g., MTGNN) bridge this gap but increase com-
plexity.

Spatial GCNs: Ideal for traffic/weather prediction with

fixed sensors.

Temporal CNNs: Best for univariate or spatially indepen-

dent series.

Integrated Methods: Essential for dynamic systems (e.g.,

finance, IoT).

dynamic relationship modeling and multi-scale aggrega-
tion. HGCN-MA’s hierarchical approach effectively captures
regional-to-local dependencies. For high-stakes applications
like disaster forecasting, STAN’s dual-path isolation of spa-
tial and temporal features provides critical modeling fidelity.

F. HYBRID MODELS: INTEGRATING DEEP LEARNING
WITH STATISTICAL METHODS
Recent studies have demonstrated that combining deep
learning models with traditional statistical methods or
domain-specific constraints can significantly enhance pre-
diction accuracy and robustness [58]. Hybrid approaches
leverage the strengths of both paradigms—statistical models
for capturing linear patterns and deep learning for modeling
nonlinear dynamics—providing a more comprehensive solu-
tion to complex time series forecasting tasks.

1) STATISTICAL-DEEP LEARNING INTEGRATION
This category integrates classical statistical forecasting mod-
els (e.g., ARIMA, ETS) with deep neural networks to
leverage their complementary strengths.

ARIMA-RNN Hybrid [59] combines ARIMA for linear
component modeling with RNNs for nonlinear residual pro-
cessing. The ARIMA module first captures linear trends and
seasonality, while the residuals (nonlinear components) are
fed into an RNN for refinement. On the Electricity Load
Dataset, this hybrid achieved 15% MAE reduction compared
to standalone models. This approach exemplifies effective
error-correction synergy between statistical and deep learning
paradigms.

ETSformer [60] integrates exponential smoothing state
space models (ETS) into Transformers through two inno-
vations: i) Exponential Smoothing Attention replacing stan-
dard self-attention for efficient recurrence, and ii) built-in
seasonal-trend decomposition layers. It reduces inference
latency by 37% vs. Autoformer on ETT data while main-
taining accuracy. This framework sets new standards for
interpretable and efficient statistical-neural fusion.

2) DECOMPOSITION-BASED HYBRID MODELS
These models explicitly decompose time series into inter-
pretable components (trend, seasonality, residuals) using
statistical or learnable methods, with deep networks modeling
residuals or sub-components.

Spatial methods excel in structured environments, while
temporal methods prioritize sequence modeling. Integrated

BEATS [61] employs iterative decomposition blocks
where each block: i) extracts features via FCN, ii) projects

153706

VOLUME 13, 2025

TABLE 5. Analysis of hybrid models.

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

interpretable trend (polynomial) and seasonal (harmonic)
components, and 3) passes residuals downstream. The inter-
pretable variant (N-BEATS-I) won the M4 competition. Its
hierarchical decomposition provides unprecedented accuracy
and explainability for heterogeneous time series.

PatchTST [62] introduces patching - splitting series into
overlapping sub-series as Transformer tokens - enabling effi-
cient long-horizon modeling. When combined with statistical
methods (e.g., ARIMA for patch-level trends), it achieves
23% lower MSE than Informer with 60% less GPU mem-
ory. Its segment-wise processing redefines efficiency for
ultra-long sequences while maintaining compatibility with
statistical techniques.

3)DOMAIN-CONSTRAINED HYBRID MODELS
Incorporates physical

constraints,
or domain knowledge as inductive biases or loss functions
within deep architectures.

laws, operational

Physics-Informed Hybrids [63] integrate domain knowl-
edge via dynamically weighted ensembles of physics-based
simulators (‘‘experts’’) and deep learners. For power load
forecasting, they explicitly model interactions between sea-
sonal trends and external factors like temperature/economic
indicators. This approach guarantees physical plausibility
while capturing complex nonlinear dynamics.

GNN-Statistical Hybrids combines Graph Neural Net-
works with statistical models (e.g., VAR, structural equa-
tions), these hybrids enforce explicit relational constraints in
multivariate forecasting. Examples include supply-chain net-
works where GNNs capture spatial dependencies while VAR
models temporal causality. They provide auditable relational
reasoning critical for high-stakes domains like economics and
epidemiology.

3) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HYBRID MODELS
Hybrid models, which synergistically integrate deep learning
with statistical methods or domain knowledge, have emerged
as a powerful paradigm for time series prediction. A compar-
ative analysis of the hybrid models is summarized in Table 5.
Hybrid models significantly enhance prediction accuracy
and robustness by synergistically integrating statistical meth-
ods (e.g., linear patterns, interpretable decomposition) with
deep learning (nonlinear dynamics, automatic feature learn-
ing). However, they involve critical trade-offs across three
dimensions:

a: ACCURACY-RICHNESS VS. COMPLEXITY
Decomposition-based hybrids (e.g., N-BEATS, Autoformer,
PatchTST) excel in capturing multi-scale components but
incur computational redundancy from iterative decomposi-
tion (N-BEATS) or patching operations (PatchTST).

Stat-DL integrations (e.g., ETSformer, ARIMA-RNN)
improve interpretability through explicit statistical founda-
tions (e.g., exponential smoothing in ETSformer), yet depend
heavily on underlying assumptions (stationarity, known
seasonality).

b: DOMAIN COMPLIANCE VS. FLEXIBILITY
Domain-constrained models enforce physical plausibility
(e.g., energy conservation in Physics-Informed Hybrids)
or relational causality (GNN-VAR), but require significant
expert knowledge for constraint design and risk over-
regularization.

c: EFFICIENCY CHALLENGES
While PatchTST reduces GPU memory by 60% via sub-series
tokenization and ETSformer cuts inference latency by 37%
via recurrence, most hybrids (e.g., N-BEATS with 30+
blocks) remain computationally intensive versus end-to-end
deep models.

Future Directions:
Automated Fusion: End-to-end joint training (e.g., differ-

entiable ARIMA layers) to replace staged pipelines.

Lightweight Decomposition: Integrated architectures like

PatchTST’s tokenization that avoid iterative residuals.

Universal Constraints: Template libraries for domain
knowledge (e.g., physics loss functions) to reduce customiza-
tion overhead.

IV. SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION AND TASK-DRIVEN
MODEL SELECTION
A. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MODEL CATEGORIES
Time series forecasting plays a critical role in numer-
ous fields, with different types of neural network models
exhibiting distinct characteristics. This section analyzes the
strengths and limitations of the five major model categories
discussed (CNN-based, RNN-based, Transformer-based,
GNN-based, Hybrid Models) and provides a comprehensive

TABLE 6. Comparative analysis of model categories.

comparison of their key attributes, summarized in Tables 6
and 7.

Generally speaking, CNN-based models are suitable for
short-term time series prediction tasks (e.g., short-term stock
price fluctuations, sensor data prediction), particularly in
scenarios with prominent local features. RNN-based mod-
els excel
in long-sequence prediction tasks (e.g., power
load forecasting, speech recognition), effectively capturing
long-term dependencies. Transformer-based models are ideal
for long-sequence and global dependency modeling tasks
(e.g., machine translation, text generation), leveraging their
powerful parallel computing capabilities. GNN-based mod-
els are well-suited for multivariate time series prediction
tasks (e.g., traffic flow forecasting, social network analy-
sis), especially in scenarios where variables exhibit complex
interdependencies. Hybrid models are suitable for complex
temporal tasks that require simultaneous capture of local
features and long-term dependencies (e.g., combining CNNs
with ARIMA to handle short-term fluctuations under high-
frequency noise) or integration of domain knowledge with
data-driven modeling (e.g., GNNs incorporating VAR for
multivariate spatial correlation analysis).

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

Based on table 8, to address the gap in practical model
selection, we propose a task-driven framework (Figure 12)
that maps key problem characteristics to optimal model
classes:

a) For short-to-medium sequences (<1000 steps) with

prominent local patterns:

Prioritize CNN/TCN models (e.g., ECG anomaly detection).
If temporal order is critical, use lightweight RNN variants

(GRU).

b) For long sequences (>1000 steps):

Adopt Transformer architectures (e.g., Informer for effi-
ciency, Autoformer for seasonal data).

If computational resources are limited, consider TCN as an

alternative.

c) For multivariate series with interdependencies:

Select GNN-based models (e.g., MTGNN for dynamic
graphs, STGCN for fixed topologies).

For variable-specific temporal patterns, iTransformer is

preferred.

d) Under strict latency/memory constraints:
Choose GRU or Kmeans-CNN for small-scale data.

Employ hybrid models (e.g., PatchTST+ARIMA) for

resource-efficient long-horizon forecasting.

Example: In traffic flow prediction (long sequences +
spatial dependencies), STGCN or MTGNN outperforms
pure temporal models. Conversely, for high-frequency stock
volatility (short sequences + low latency needs), TCN is
optimal. This framework bridges theoretical capabilities with
pragmatic deployment considerations.

Selecting a forecasting model also requires navigating

core, often competing, priorities:

Modeling Power vs. Efficiency: High capacity for
complex/long-range patterns (Transformers, GNNs, deep
TCN/LSTM) demands significant computation. Simpler
models (basic CNN, linear) are efficient but limited.

Sequential Fidelity vs. Parallel Speed: RNNs (LSTM/GRU)
naturally handle order/causality but train slowly (sequen-
tial). CNNs/Transformers leverage parallelism for speed but
require explicit mechanisms (causal convolutions, masking)
for causality.

Automatic Learning vs. Interpretability: Deep models
excel at feature learning but are ‘‘black boxes.’’ Simpler
statistical models or hybrids offer more transparency but need
manual feature engineering or lack flexibility.

Generalization

vs. Specialization: General models
(LSTM/GRU, vanilla Transformer) need more data. Special-
ized models (Autoformer for seasonality, SCINet for trends,
GNNs for relational data) can be data-efficient if their bias
matches the data, but fail if assumptions break.

There is no universally optimal model. Selection should
be guided by matching the model’s strengths to the specific
problem requirements and constraints. Prioritizing the most
critical trade-offs for a given task is essential. Table 8 and
the preceding category-specific analyses serve as valuable
frameworks to inform this decision-making process.

B. CROSS-MODEL AND CROSS-DATASET TREND
ANALYSIS (META-ANALYSIS)
While Sections III and IV-A-C provide detailed analyses
of individual models and categories, this section synthe-
sizes broader trends observed across diverse time series
datasets and prediction tasks, drawing upon empirical find-
ings from numerous benchmark studies [3], [4], [8], [10].
This meta-analysis aims to identify patterns regarding which

architectural paradigms or specific variants excel under par-
ticular data characteristics and task requirements.

(1) Long-Term Dependencies in Multivariate Settings
Transformer Variants Dominate: Models based on the
Transformer architecture, particularly those incorporating
efficient attention mechanisms (e.g.,Informer’s ProbSparse
attention, Autoformer’s series decomposition and auto-
correlation), consistently demonstrate superior performance

VOLUME 13, 2025

153709

in capturing very long-range dependencies (\>1000 steps)
within multivariate datasets (e.g., ETT, Electricity) [36], [37].
Their ability to model global dependencies directly gives
them an edge over sequential models like RNNs/LSTMs for
ultra-long horizons.

GNNs for Structured Multivariate Dependencies: When
strong spatial or relational dependencies exist between
variables (e.g.,
traffic sensor networks, supply chains),
GNN-based models (STGCN, MTGNN) significantly out-
perform models treating channels independently [51], [52].
MTGNN’s ability to learn dynamic graph structures endows
it with particular robustness in scenarios where relationships
evolve.

iTransformer’s Emergence: Recent work on iTrans-
former [39] shows remarkable promise, often achieving state-
of-the-art results on multivariate benchmarks without relying
on predefined graphs. Its inverted architecture (variables as
tokens, time points as features) proves highly effective for
capturing inter-variable dependencies while leveraging the
Transformer’s FFN for temporal modeling, demonstrating
strong generalization across diverse multivariate domains.
(2) Transformer Variant Generalization Across Domains
Informer for Efficiency:Informer establishes itself as a
robust and efficient baseline for long-sequence forecast-
ing across various domains (energy, traffic, finance) due to
its ProbSparse attention and distilling mechanism [36]. Its
computational advantages make it a practical choice when
resources are constrained.

Autoformer for Strong Seasonality/Trends: Autoformer
exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities in domains
characterized by prominent seasonal and trend compo-
nents(e.g., energy load, weather, retail sales) [37]. Its built-in
series decomposition and auto-correlation mechanism are key
to this strength.

Decomposition is Key: A recurring theme among the
most generalizable Transformer variants (Autoformer, FED-
former [40], PatchTST [58]) is the explicit or implicit
incorporation of time series decomposition. This architec-
tural bias aligns well with the inherent structure of many
real-world time series, enhancing robustness across different
domains.

iTransformer’s Strong Multivariate Generalization: iTrans-
former demonstrates impressive generalization specifically
in the multivariate forecasting setting, often outperforming
other Transformer variants (like Autoformer and FEDformer)
on standard benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of its
variable-centric tokenization approach for diverse multivari-
ate data.

Trade-off: Specialization vs. Generality: While models
like Scaleformer [45] offer extreme efficiency for ultra-long
horizons, and CrossFormer [46] excels at modeling com-
plex multi-periodicity, their performance gains can be more
sensitive to specific data characteristics (e.g., defined season-
alities) compared to the more broadly applicable Informer or
Autoformer. PatchTST offers a good balance of efficiency
and generality through its patching strategy.

X. Ao et al.: Review of Time Series Prediction Models Based on Deep Learning

(3) Addressing Computational Cost & Real-Time

Constraints:

RNNs/GRUs Remain Relevant: For medium-length
sequences (\∼100-1000 steps) and scenarios demanding
low-latency inference,GRUs (and to a lesser extent, LSTMs)
remain competitive due to their lower computational over-
head per step compared to Transformers [25], [30]. TCN also
offers a strong parallelizable alternative for these sequence
lengths [14].

Lightweight Transformers & Hybrids: Efficient Trans-
former variants (Informer, PatchTST) and hybrid models
combining simple statistical methods with deep learning
(e.g., ARIMA-RNN, PatchTST + statistical smoothing) pro-
vide viable pathways for deployment in resource-constrained
or real-time environments [59], [62]. PatchTST’s patching
mechanism significantly reduces memory footprint.

(4) The Role of Hybrid Models:
Accuracy & Robustness:Decomposition-based hybrids
(N-BEATS, Autoformer) frequently top benchmark leader-
boards due to their ability to separate and model different tem-
poral components [37], [61]. Domain-constrained hybrids
demonstrate superior robustness and data efficiency when
domain knowledge is accurately incorporated [63].

Interpretability: Hybrids, especially N-BEATS-I (inter-
pretable version) and models integrating statistical com-
ponents (ETSformer [60]), offer significantly enhanced
interpretability compared to pure deep learning black boxes.
(5) Emerging Trend Recent models like iTransformer
(unifying multivariate dependency and temporal modeling
within a standard Transformer block) and PatchTST (sim-
plifying long-horizon forecasting via sub-series tokenization)
suggest a move towards simpler, more unified architectures
that maintain high performance while reducing complex,
custom-designed components. This contrasts with earlier
trends of increasing model specialization (e.g., Autoformer’s
specific decomposition blocks).

V. CONCLUSION
Driven by rapid advancements in information technology,
time series data has proliferated across numerous fields,
and deep learning-based time series prediction models have
become a focal point of research and application in both
academia and industry. This paper comprehensively reviews
the application of various mainstream deep learning models
in time series prediction, including key technologies such
as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Transformer models, Graph Neural Net-
works (GNN), and hybrid models, while elaborating on their
fundamental principles, structural characteristics, strengths,
and real-world use cases in different domains.

Through an in-depth exploration of these models, it is evi-
dent that different deep learning architectures possess unique
advantages tailored to specific types of time series prediction
tasks. RNNs demonstrate strengths in handling data with
long-term dependencies; CNNs excel at extracting local fea-
tures from time series; Transformers leverage their powerful

parallel computing capabilities and global attention mecha-
nisms to capture complex dependencies in long sequences;
and GNNs integrate topological structures to precisely model
interdependencies within time series. Hybrid models can
enhance prediction robustness and interpretability by com-
bining the modeling of linear and nonlinear features with the
incorporation of physical constraints or domain knowledge.
However, despite significant progress in deep learning-
based time series prediction, challenges remain. For instance,
the interpretability of models continues to be a critical
issue in deep learning. In practical applications, users often
require insights into the model’s decision-making process and
prediction rationale to enhance data analysis and decision-
making. Additionally, the high computational complexity
of deep learning models demands substantial computational
resources and time. Addressing computational efficiency for
large-scale time series data remains an unresolved challenge.
Future research directions for deep learning-based time

series prediction models may focus on the following areas:

(a) Enhancing Model Interpretability: Developing visu-
alization tools and explanation methods (e.g., attention
analysis, feature importance attribution) to improve the trans-
parency of model decisions and predictions.

(b)) Optimizing Efficiency: Exploring more efficient algo-
rithms and architectures (e.g., model compression, neural
architecture search, efficient attention mechanisms) to reduce
computational complexity and improve scalability.

(c) Integrating Multi-Source Data and Domain Knowl-
edge: Enhancing model generalization and accuracy through
the effective fusion of heterogeneous data sources (e.g.,
sensor data,
images) and the incorporation of
domain-specific expertise (e.g., physical laws, operational
constraints).

text,

(d) Advancing Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineer-
ing: Improving data quality and model usability through
refined preprocessing techniques (e.g., handling missing
values, normalization, decomposition) and feature extrac-
tion/selection strategies (e.g., automated feature learning,
domain-informed features).

In conclusion, deep learning has introduced new oppor-
tunities and breakthroughs in time series prediction. While
challenges persist, ongoing technological advancements will
enable these models to play an increasingly vital role
across diverse fields. They will provide robust support for
decision-making, risk assessment, and resource optimization,
propelling intelligent development in various industries to
new heights.

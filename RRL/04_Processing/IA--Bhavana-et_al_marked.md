ABSTRACT: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful driver of innovation in financial technology
(FinTech), enabling predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and automated advisory services. Yet, most personal
finance applications remain limited, focusing primarily on reactive expense tracking rather than proactive wealth
management. This paper introduces AI Wealth Advisor, an intelligent system designed to deliver personalized budget
planning, financial goal setting, and expenditure optimization using machine learning and predictive analytics. The
system integrates classification, forecasting, anomaly detection, and explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparent, real-
time financial guidance. Through Natural Language Generation (NLG), it translates complex analytics into simple,
actionable recommendations, accessible to individuals across diverse literacy levels. A pilot study showed promising
results: anomaly detection accuracy of 95%, a 22% improvement in savings, and enhanced financial literacy for 78% of
participants. In addition to performance improvements, the system addresses challenges related to privacy, fairness, and
user trust. This report details the methodology, research workflow, and results of AI Wealth Advisor, supported by
visual analytics. Findings indicate that the system can bridge the gap between advanced financial analytics and practical
usability, positioning itself as a scalable digital companion that empowers individuals to achieve sustainable financial
well-being.

I. INTRODUCTION
Financial literacy is widely recognized as a key determinant of economic well-being, shaping individuals’ ability to
plan, save, invest, and navigate increasingly complex financial ecosystems. However, evidence highlights major gaps in
this area. The Global Financial Literacy Survey (GFLEC, 2023) reported that more than 60% of adults worldwide lack
understanding of fundamental concepts such as compound interest, inflation, and risk diversification [1]. These
deficiencies often result in unsustainable indebtedness, poor retirement planning, and heightened susceptibility to fraud,
with consequences particularly severe in emerging economies where access to financial education is limited [2].
Traditional financial management tools, such as spreadsheets and ledger systems, provide basic record-keeping but lack
predictive and adaptive capabilities. Modern budgeting applications like Mint, YNAB, and PocketGuard [3] improve
automation and visualization but remain primarily reactive, rule-based, and unable to adapt to dynamic financial
behaviors [4]. By contrast, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have demonstrated transformative
applications in financial services [5–7]. Despite advancements in fraud detection, risk scoring, and portfolio
optimization, most AI-driven tools remain enterprise-focused, leaving a significant gap in personalized, consumer-
centric financial advisory solutions.
To address this gap, this study proposes AI Wealth Advisor, an intelligent system for proactive financial management.
The system integrates multiple AI techniques, including predictive analytics for income and expenditure forecasting,
anomaly detection for fraud prevention, Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency, and Natural Language Generation
(NLG) for delivering insights in user-friendly language. Unlike conventional tools, AI Wealth Advisor is designed to
be predictive, personalized, and interpretable, thereby enhancing accessibility and trust among users.

This research contributes a novel AI-driven architecture for personal finance, validated through pilot studies, while also
addressing challenges of bias, privacy, and user adoption. The system aims not only to improve individual financial
outcomes but also to advance the broader field of intelligent financial technologies.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become pivotal in modern financial systems, addressing
critical challenges such as fraud detection, forecasting, personalized advisory, portfolio optimization, and regulatory
compliance. Recent research highlights diverse applications and methodological innovations that enhance operational
efficiency, accuracy, and trustworthiness in financial services.
Fraud detection remains a primary focus of AI applications in finance. Mohammed et al. (2021) utilized Autoencoders
with Isolation Forest on bank transaction logs from European financial institutions, achieving 96% detection accuracy,
reducing false positives by 12%, and demonstrating scalability to large datasets. Ensemble learning approaches
(Carcillo et al., 2019) further improved fraud detection in imbalanced credit card datasets, effectively balancing
precision-recall trade-offs and enabling real-time monitoring.
In financial forecasting, hybrid models combining ARIMA and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (Zhang et al., 2022)
enhanced household expenditure predictions, reducing mean absolute error by 18% and demonstrating robustness under
noisy conditions. Deep learning models, particularly LSTM and RNN architectures (Makridakis et al., 2018),
outperformed traditional econometric methods, effectively capturing seasonal patterns and ensuring long-term
predictive stability.
AI has also facilitated personalized financial advisory and portfolio management. NLP-driven financial assistants
(Yang et al., 2023) improved accessibility for low-literacy users and enhanced financial confidence, while generative
AI agents (Kury et al., 2025) enabled interactive, tailored recommendations, albeit with concerns regarding
transparency and hallucinations. Contextual bandit approaches (Li et al., 2021) have further optimized recommendation
systems, increasing user engagement by 25% and reducing redundant suggestions. Reinforcement learning techniques
(Bauman et al., 2023) adaptively optimized portfolio allocations under market volatility, outperforming static strategies.
Trust, explainability, and regulatory compliance are critical for AI adoption in financial contexts. Explainable AI
methods, such as SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) and LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), have enhanced transparency in
black-box models, supporting regulatory validation. Priya et al. (2024) demonstrated that XAI frameworks improve
interpretability and mitigate compliance risks. Moreover, differential privacy mechanisms (Abadi et al., 2016) ensure
the confidentiality of sensitive financial data, while fairness-aware ML methods (Barocas et al., 2019) address
algorithmic biases in lending decisions.
Foundational research in technology adoption (Davis et al., 1989) emphasizes the importance of usability and
simplicity for effective AI adoption, and deep learning principles (Goodfellow et al., 2016) continue to underpin
modern financial models. Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of AI and ML in finance,
enabling accurate, personalized, transparent, and ethically aligned solutions across multiple domains, from fraud
detection to advisory services and regulatory compliance.

III. METHODOLOGY OF PROPOSED SURVEY
The design and implementation of AI Wealth Advisor follows a systematic methodology aimed at ensuring accuracy,
transparency, scalability, and user trust. The methodology is structured into six major components: datasets,
preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, explainability integration, and evaluation.
3.1 DataSet
Datasets form the foundation of AI-driven financial advisory systems, as the quality and richness of the data directly
influence the accuracy of predictions, the reliability of anomaly detection, and the personalization of recommendations.
In the context of an AI Wealth Advisor, one of the most important data sources is transaction data, which includes
income deposits, debit and credit card purchases, recurring bill payments, and subscription charges. These records,
often accessed through secure banking APIs enabled by frameworks like Open Banking (PSD2 in Europe), provide
time-stamped, user-specific information that allows models to detect spending patterns, forecast future expenditures,
and flag unusual behavior. Complementing individual-level data, household expenditure surveys such as the U.S.
Consumer Expenditure Survey and India’s National Sample Survey provide population-wide insights into income and
spending across demographic groups. These datasets serve as valuable benchmarks and help address the cold-start
problem, where new users with limited transaction history can be supported through generalized expenditure patterns.
At a broader level, financial behavior is shaped not only by personal habits but also by macroeconomic conditions,
making datasets that track inflation rates, employment levels, interest rates, and stock indices essential. Sources like the
World Bank, IMF, and OECD provide such indicators, enabling the AI Wealth Advisor to contextualize predictions
within larger economic trends, such as rising prices or industry-specific downturns. Fraud and anomaly detection, a
critical security component of advisory systems, relies heavily on specialized datasets like the European Credit Card
Fraud Dataset, which includes labeled examples of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Since fraudulent activity
typically constitutes less than 1% of all transactions, these datasets are highly imbalanced, requiring advanced
resampling strategies and anomaly detection algorithms such as Autoencoders and Isolation Forests. However, privacy
restrictions limit access to real financial records, creating a strong need for synthetic and augmented datasets.
3.2 Preprocessing
Raw transaction data is often noisy, unstructured, and incomplete. Preprocessing ensures data quality and consistency:
 Cleaning: Duplicate and erroneous entries are removed.
 Normalization: Currency values are standardized to avoid inconsistencies across regions.
 Categorization: Merchant codes and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are used to classify expenses into
predefined categories (e.g., housing, transport, food, healthcare) [5].
 Anonymization: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stripped to ensure privacy compliance with GDPR and
CCPA [6].
 Imputation: Missing values are filled using statistical methods (mean substitution, KNN imputation).
This ensures the dataset is clean, balanced, and ready for feature extraction.

||Volume 8, Issue 5, September-October 2025||
DOI:10.15662/IJARCST.2025.0805004
3.3 Feature Engineering
To make data actionable, meaningful features are extracted:
 Financial Ratios: Savings-to-income, debt-to-income, and liquidity ratios.
 Behavioral Patterns: Average transaction frequency, spending spikes, seasonality trends.
 Derived Indicators: Credit utilization rate, financial stress index, and monthly net cash flow.
 Temporal Features: Day-of-week and month-of-year indicators for seasonality.
For anomaly detection, statistical features such as z-scores, transaction deviation, and spending volatility are engineered
[7].
3.4 Model Development
AI Wealth Advisor employs a multi-model architecture designed for classification, forecasting, anomaly detection, and
personalized recommendations.
3.4.1 Classification Models
For categorizing expenses:
 XGBoost [8] and Random Forests are used for structured data.
 BERT-based NLP models [9] classify unstructured transaction descriptions. Performance is evaluated using F1-
score and accuracy metrics.
3.4.2 Forecasting Models
Predicting future expenditure is achieved using:
 ARIMA for short-term linear forecasting.
 Prophet (Meta) for seasonality-adjusted trends [10].
 LSTM Networks [11] for long-term non-linear forecasting.
 Transformers [12] for capturing global sequential dependencies.
Ensemble forecasting combines these models to reduce error rates.
3.4.3 Anomaly Detection Models
Fraudulent or unusual spending behavior is flagged using:
 Isolation Forests for detecting outliers.
 Autoencoders [3] for reconstructing transaction patterns.
 GAN-based anomaly detectors for adversarial detection.
3.4.4 Recommendation Engine
Personalized budget and savings recommendations use:
 Contextual Bandits [13] for adaptive suggestions.
 Reinforcement Learning [14] to dynamically adjust recommendations based on user feedback.
3.5 Explainable AI (XAI) Integration
Transparency is central to user trust. AI Wealth Advisor integrates:
 SHAP values [15] to explain feature importance for each prediction.
 LIME [16] for model-agnostic interpretability.
 Rule-based summaries for non-technical users.
For example, instead of “anomaly detected with probability 0.92,” the system explains: “Your grocery expenses this
week were 38% higher than your usual pattern, likely due to festival-related purchases.”
3.6 Security and Privacy Safeguards
Given the sensitivity of financial data, security measures include:
 Encryption: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit [4].
 Differential Privacy [17]: Adds controlled noise to protect user data.
 Federated Learning [18]: Enables training on user devices without centralizing raw data.
 Access Controls: Role-based authentication to limit system access.

DOI:10.15662/IJARCST.2025.0805004
3.7 Evaluation Metrics
The system is evaluated across multiple dimensions:
 Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
 Forecasting: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R².
 Anomaly Detection: Area Under ROC Curve (AUC), Precision-Recall AUC.
 Recommendations: Adoption rate (% of suggestions followed), User Satisfaction (survey-based).
 Usability: System Usability Scale (SUS) score [19].
Pilot testing with 100 users demonstrated:
 Expense classification accuracy = 91% F1-score.
 Forecasting error = MAE of $43/month per user.
 Anomaly detection accuracy = 95%.
 Recommendation adoption rate = 41%.
3.8 Ethical Considerations
Financial AI systems carry risks of bias, exclusion, and manipulation. To mitigate this:
 Fairness-Aware Algorithms [13]: Ensure recommendations do not disproportionately disadvantage vulnerable
groups.
 Transparency Reports: Provide users with system performance summaries.
 Consent Management: Explicit opt-in mechanisms for data collection.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
AI WealthAdvisor represents a comprehensive approach to personal financial management by integrating budget
planning, anomaly detection, forecasting, and explainable recommendations. The system bridges the gap between
advanced analytics and financial literacy, empowering users to save more, avoid fraud, and build financial confidence.
Pilot studies validate its impact with measurable improvements in savings and awareness. Challenges include data
privacy, algorithmic bias, and scalability across diverse financial ecosystems. Future directions include reinforcement
learning for adaptive budgeting, generative AI for conversational advisory, and integration into wider financial
services. With ethical safeguards, AI WealthAdvisor has the potential to become a scalable financial companion for
individuals worldwide.
The findings confirm that AI Wealth Advisor is effective in bridging the gap between advanced AI analytics and real-
world usability. By combining forecasting, anomaly detection, personalization, and explainability, the system not only
